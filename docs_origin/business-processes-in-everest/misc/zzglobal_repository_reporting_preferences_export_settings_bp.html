<p>Specify the location of your global reports repository. <strong>Everest Reports</strong> reside in, and are accessed  from this location.</p>

<p class="note">• The reports repository location in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box (Path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> &gt;  <strong>General</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Report 
 Settings</strong> tab) overrides this selection.</p>

<p>• All repository paths in <strong>Everest</strong>  are stored in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths. On a network, the  UNC is a method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer,  without having to specify the storage device it is on. For Windows, the  UNC name format is \servername\sharename\path\filename.</p>

<p>• You can specify the reports repository of the local workstation, or  another server/workstation on your network, as the global reports repository.</p>
