<h1 id="prompt-if-the-orderedreceived-quantity-is-less-than-eoq">Prompt if the ordered/received quantity is less than EOQ</h1>

<p>Check this box to have the system prompt you on saving the  document if the input quantity ordered in a purchase order or received  in a purchase receipt differs from the EOQ. When prompted, you may save  the document with the different quantity or postpone the save so you can  edit the ordered/received quantity.</p>

<p>On migration from Everest 3.0 to Everest 4.0, the system  defaults to Single Unit of Purchase Measure for the default quantity with  the prompt checkbox checked. When setting up a new company, the system  defaults to EOQ with the prompt checkbox unchecked.</p>
