  <dt><strong>Prompt for customer credit status when sales  order is converted into sales invoice in the pull sheet browser</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this option to check if customers have exceeded  their credit limit and/or are on credit hold, when a sales order is converted  to an invoice in the <strong>Pull Sheet</strong>  browser.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/lens.gif" alt="" /><a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/misc/prompt_for_cust_credit_status_when_so_is_converted_into_si.html">Prompt  for customer credit status when sales order is converted into sales invoice  in the pull sheet browser</a></dd>
  <dt><strong>Automatically  transfer pending authorizations from Sales Order to Sales Invoice</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select whether or not pending credit card authorizations  available in the sales order should be automatically transferred when  a sales order is converted to a sales invoice. Enabling this option allows  you to more easily process payments from the batch payment browsers after  an order has been shipped.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">When an order is partially invoiced and this  option is enabled, the system will transfer the pending authorization  to the partial invoice and retain a copy for the remainder of the order.  This copied batch payment will use the same credit card information but  will change to a “Sale” type transaction during future processing. The  type change happens because the authorization will be consumed by the  partial invoice.</p>
