<p>Check this option to display the printed documents in matrix  format for matrix items. The line items that are part of a matrix group  will be printed in a matrix format. Printing in matrix format can greatly  reduce the amount of space/paper it takes to print out a document with  a large number of matrix items. Vendor part numbers and serial numbers  will not display if you select this option.</p>

<p>When you select this option, the <strong>Display 
 in matrix format</strong> check box is checked by default in the <strong>Document 
 Printing Preferences</strong> and <strong>Document 
 E-mail Preferences</strong> dialog boxes.</p>
