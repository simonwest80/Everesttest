<p>The <strong>Purchase Order</strong> is the second  document generated in the purchase process. The purchase order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created  when you decide to purchase products or services from a vendor.</li>
  <li>Records details  of the order placed.</li>
  <li>Helps in materials  planning (the quantities already on order and their expected delivery  dates are considered before placing further orders).</li>
  <li>Records the  receipt of items whose quality has to be assessed before they are accounted  into stock.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information from the purchase order flows into the purchase receipt  and invoice.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> also enables you to  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handle drop  shipments (a purchase order can be created from a sales order).</li>
  <li>Generate purchase  orders in bulk for items, based on inventory levels and for existing sales  orders.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  purchase order is an intermediate or pending document. Accounting entries  are <strong>not</strong> generated when a purchase  order is created unless deposits have been made against the order.</p>
