<p>You can create system documents by using the quotes, orders, invoices,  receipts and memo documents from the Purchasing, Invoicing and Inventory  menus. <strong>Everest</strong> automatically generates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The accounting  entries (for the final system documents).</li>
  <li>The sequence numbers  for the system documents.</li>
</ul>

<p>System documents are further classified into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intermediate/Pending 
 documents</strong> - Intermediate/Pending documents are created at the initial  stage of a business transaction. Accounting entries are not generated  at this stage.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" />  A  purchase quote is an intermediate or pending document which indicates  the beginning of the purchase cycle.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Final 
 documents</strong> - Final documents are created from the pending documents  to complete the purchase, sale or return process. Accounting entries are  automatically generated when these documents are created.</li>
</ul>
