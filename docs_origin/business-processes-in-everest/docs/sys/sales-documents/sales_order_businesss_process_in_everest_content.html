<p>The <strong>Sales Order</strong> is the second  document generated in the sales process. The sales order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created  when a customer places an order for products or services.</li>
  <li>Records details  of the order placed.</li>
  <li>Helps in materials  planning (the quantities on order and their expected delivery dates are  considered for the calculation of available stock and for placing the  purchase orders).</li>
  <li>Records the  quantities of items reserved against the order. (You can identify the  exact items to be shipped, or the stock area from which it is to be shipped).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  sales order is an intermediate or pending document. Accounting entries  are not generated when a sales order is created, unless deposits have  been received against the order (a Receipt Journal is created).</p>
