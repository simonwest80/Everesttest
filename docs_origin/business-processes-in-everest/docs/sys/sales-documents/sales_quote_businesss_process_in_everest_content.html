<p>The <strong>Sales Quote</strong> is the first  document generated in the sales process. The sales quote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Records details  of quotations sent to customers.</li>
  <li>Helps the sales  department to follow up with prospective customers on the various quotes  issued.</li>
  <li>Tracks prospective  customers and the value of sales expected, using the Sales Opportunity  feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the sales quote flows into the sales order</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  sales quote is an intermediate or pending document. Accounting entries  are not generated when a sales quote is created.</p>
