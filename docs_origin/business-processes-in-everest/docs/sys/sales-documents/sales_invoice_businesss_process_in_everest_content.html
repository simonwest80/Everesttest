<p>The <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> is the last  document in the sales process. A sales invoice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created  when inventoried items are shipped to a customer, or customers are billed  for services rendered.</li>
  <li>Records details  of the items and services purchased by the customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the sales order flows into the sales invoice.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  sales invoice is the final document which updates the inventory values,  customer balances, stocks and accounts receivable. Accounting entries  are automatically generated when a sales invoice is created.</p>
