<p>When a Work Order is issued, the materials required for the work order  are reduced from their inventories and added to the inventory of the work-in-progress.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  Accounting  entries are generated when the value of the inventory is transferred from  production to work-in-progress, and from work-in-progress to the Built  stage.</p>
