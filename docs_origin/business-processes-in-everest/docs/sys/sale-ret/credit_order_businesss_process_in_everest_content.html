<p>The <strong>Credit Order</strong> is the second  document generated in the sales return process. The credit order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created when  you issue a Return Merchandize  Authorization to the customer.</li>
  <li>Records details  of the proposed returns.</li>
  <li>Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered in assessing the quantities to be purchased).</li>
  <li>Records the dispatch  of items by a customer for repairs or replacement. You can record the  returned quantities and the stock areas in which you expect to receive  the returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the credit order flows into the credit memo.</p>

<p class="note">The credit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are <strong>not</strong>  generated when a credit order is created. A credit order can also be generated  from a sales invoice.</p>
