<dl>
  <dt><strong>When applying document discounts how should the  discount be applied?</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field identifies how global discounts are applied.  You can select <strong>Options &gt;</strong> <strong>Document</strong> &gt; <strong>Document 
 Discount</strong> from the sales document profile and specify the discount  percent. When applying discounts in sales documents, you can reduce the  <strong>Item Price</strong>, or retain the item  price and display the Discount Amount applied. Select one of the following  options to apply the document discount:</dd>
</dl>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Option</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Discount%</td>
      <td>The discount amount and percentage are displayed in the respective columns  for each item in the document.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Price</td>
      <td>The item price displayed in the document is reduced by the discount  amount. The discount columns do not display any values.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="example"><strong>A company allows a discount of 3% on total  bill amount while another company gives a discount price of $25 on the  total bill amount if the bill amount exceeds $250. The settings allow  you to select the correct option.</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Behavior for price column if quoted/ ordered  quantity is changed and new price is available</strong></dt>
  <dd><strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to define how should the price alter when the quoted/ordered  quantity is changed and new price is available.</dd>
  <dt><strong>A company orders a pack of 100 CD-ROMs at  a price of $75. It later changes the order to 10 packs of 1000 CD-ROMs.  The vendor gives a special discount price of $700 instead of $750. Various  options are available as shown below to apply pricing in such an instance.</strong></dt>
  <dd>The price applicable to an item is calculated after  considering all pricing schemes when you retrieve the item into the sales  document. If the quantity of an item is changed and thus another price  becomes applicable to the item, the price may be changed automatically  or <strong>Everest</strong> may prompt you depending  on the option selected in this field. <strong>Everest</strong>  provides you with the following options:</dd>

<p class="note">This option is applicable only if the quoted or ordered quantity is  changed in a sales document.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Customer level price to override list price for  price calculation</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option alters the manner in which the least  price is determined in sales orders and invoices. <strong>Everest</strong>  considers five types of pricing to arrive at the least price:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>List price  (Fixed price/Mark up)</li>
  <li>Customer level  price</li>
  <li>Quantity pricing</li>
  <li>Promotional  pricing</li>
  <li>Special pricing  (Discount percent from least price/ Discount fixed amount from least price/Fixed  price/Markup over last landed cost/Mark up over average cost/Fixed amount  over cost/ Level pricing)</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>: If this option is not checked, the least of the  above five prices is considered.</dt>
  <dd>If this option is selected, the List Price is overridden  with the Customer Level Price if it is defined and only Customer Level  price, Quantity pricing, Promotional pricing, and Special pricing are  considered to arrive at the least price.</dd>
  <dd>If this option is selected and a Customer Level  price is not defined, only the List Price, Quantity Pricing, Promotional  pricing, and Special pricing are considered to arrive at the least price.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Automatically apply item discounts applicable  to a customer when retrieving the item on a document</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option automatically applies item discounts  based on special pricing rules or quantity discounts for selected customer  levels, when items are retrieved into a sales document. The discounts  related to items are defined in the <strong>Sales</strong>  tab of the <strong>Item</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</dd>

</dl>

<p class="example"><strong>Item discounts are set for special items like  computer consumables for customers who place bulk orders.  </strong>Everest**  allows you to apply the special pricing allowed for the customer when  such an item is pulled into a document.**</p>

  <dd>Check this box to exclude special pricing rules  that have been assigned to matrix groups or custom tracking assigned to  matrix elements.</dd>

<p class="example"><strong>A garment company sells more than 10,000 varieties  of garments which are inventoried as matrix groups/items. The company  also sells 50 different items as accessories. For setting a special discount  only for the accessories, apply special pricing to all the items in the  **Special Pricing</strong> browser (path:  <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Discounts</strong>  &gt; <strong>Special Pricing</strong>), and select  this checkbox to ignore the special pricing for the matrix groups.**</p>
