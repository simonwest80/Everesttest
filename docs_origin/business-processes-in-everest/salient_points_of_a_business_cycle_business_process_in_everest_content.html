<ul>
  <li>Each function  goes through defined steps in a process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">To make a purchase, you have to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Obtain quotes from a list of vendors.
    <ul>
      <li>Place an order for an approved quote.</li>
      <li>Receive the items.</li>
      <li>Inspect and approve the items.</li>
      <li>Make vendor payments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>All the functions  are interdependent.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Inventory increases when you purchase an item.</p>

<p>Inventory decreases when you make a sale.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documents evidence  of transactions in each process.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">A purchase quote records quotations received from vendors.</p>

<p>A sales order records orders received from customers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accounting entries  increase or decrease the assets and liabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Accounting entries are generated when items are received into stock  but not when an order is placed.</p>
