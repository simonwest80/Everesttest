<dl>
  <dt><strong>Type of cost to be displayed in inventory browsers,  stock transfers and pricing analysis</strong></dt>
  <dd>Set the default item cost type to be displayed in  the <strong>Items</strong> browser, on stock transfer  documents and browsers, and the <strong>Pricing</strong><strong>Analysis</strong> dialog box.</dd>
  <dd>The prices displayed in these browsers depend on  whether you are in extended mode or not. All the costs of the item are  displayed as such when you are in extended mode. On clearing the <strong>Enable Extended Mode</strong> check box in the  <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Workstation Settings</strong>), the display of the different costs  varies, which is elucidated in the table below.</dd>
