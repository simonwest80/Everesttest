<p>The average cost, sales price, markup and margin are displayed in this  section.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Cost</strong></dt>
  <dd>The average cost per unit of purchase. The cost  is arrived at by dividing the total purchase value by the total quantity  of purchase.</dd>
  <dd>This cost may be different from the average cost  of the items in stock.</dd>
  <dd>The cost displayed in this field is different from  the average cost in the following cases:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>The item’s  purchase measure is not a single unit.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example"><strong>If  the purchase measure is a dozen, the average cost displayed in this field  is per unit whereas in the **Item</strong> profile,  the average cost per dozen is displayed.**</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Sell</strong></dt>
  <dd>The average selling price per unit of sale is displayed.  The sell price is arrived at by dividing the total sales value by the  total quantity of sale. This is the same as the <strong>Average 
 Price</strong> field available in the Field Chooser of the <strong>Items</strong>  browser.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Profit</strong></dt>
  <dd>The profit on each unit of the item is displayed.  The profit is computed by reducing the average cost from the average sales  price.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Markup</strong></dt>
  <dd>The average mark up on cost is displayed. <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">A negative amount in the markup and cost fields indicates 
 a loss on the sale of the item.</font></dd>
  <dd>The average mark up on cost is computed using the  formula:</dd>
  <dd>[(Average sell (price) - Average cost)/Average cost]*100</dd>
