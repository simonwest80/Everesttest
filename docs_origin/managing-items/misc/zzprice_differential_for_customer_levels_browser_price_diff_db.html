<p>Price Differential is defined as a percentage or a flat amount. By default,  this percentage or flat amount is applicable to all the customers who  purchase the item. You can specify the price differential (as a percentage  or a flat amount) for each customer level separately. All customer levels  that have been defined are displayed in the <strong>Price 
 Differential for Customer Levels</strong> section.</p>

<p>The price differential for each customer level is different from the  price to which the differential is applied.</p>

<p class="example">You specify  a price differential of flat $2 in general to upgrade from A to B. Item  A’s price is $10 but the price for level 1 is $8. When upgrade is done  for customer in level 1, the upgrade price will be $10 (8+2). For customers  at level none, the upgrade price will be $12 (10+2).</p>

<p>Now, if you specify a price differential for level 1 at $1.75 instead  of $2; the price for customer level 1 will be taken for such customers  AND the price differential for level 1 if it exists will be used; so in  this case, it would be 9.75 (8+1.75).</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have  selected any of the first five options in the <strong>Percentage/Amount</strong>  field, the <strong>Percent</strong> and <strong>Amount</strong>  columns will be displayed in this section.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Percent</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter a percentage for each customer level in the  <strong>Percent</strong> column. It is not mandatory  to enter a percentage for every customer level.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>The amount of price differential is calculated and  displayed in the <strong>Amount</strong> field  for each customer level. You cannot edit this column.</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>If you have  selected the <strong>Flat Amount (+ or -)</strong>  option, only the <strong>Amount</strong> column  is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Amount</strong></p>

<p>Enter a flat amount for each customer level.</p>
