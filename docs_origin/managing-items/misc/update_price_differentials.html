<h1 id="update-price-differentials">Update Price Differentials</h1>

<p>Whenever there is a difference in the price of an item and its upgrade,  the difference has to be entered either as a fixed price or can be arrived  at by specifying a formula.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a change in the cost (average cost or last cost),  or selling price of an upgraded item and the alternate item, you have  to re-apply the formula to calculate the new Price Differential. This  is a highly cumbersome and time-consuming process.</p>

<p>In order to simplify the process of updating the Price Differentials  during such circumstances, <strong>Everest</strong>  has provided with an <strong>Update Price Differentials</strong>  feature. This feature allows you to update the price difference for both  items and kits.</p>
