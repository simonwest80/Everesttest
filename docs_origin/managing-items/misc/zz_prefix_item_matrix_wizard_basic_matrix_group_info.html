<p>The code of an individual matrix item is made up of a combination  of the elements defined in the later sections of this wizard. The prefix  is entered in this field. You can enter a unique code of up to fifteen  characters in the Prefix field. This is a mandatory field.</p>

<p>Specify a Prefix for your Item Matrix.</p>

<p class="example">The prefix is <strong>87456</strong>  in this example.</p>

<p class="note">It is always better to create a Prefix of  shorter length to control the length of the matrix item code.</p>
