<p>Promotions or promotional campaigns are methods of increasing your sales.  Promotional campaigns are carried out by offering discounts or free items  for certain items for a specified time period to attract more customers.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>You can create offers that are valid only  for a certain period to attract customers quickly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> helps you to keep track  of the costs (like advertisements, brochures, printing etc.) incurred  for these promotions. You can create promotion codes that can be attached  to special pricing profiles and sales documents. The promotion code helps  to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up prices  specific to promotion campaigns</li>
  <li>keep track  of revenue and expenses for the promotion</li>
  <li>calculate the  net profit earned during the period of promotion</li>
</ul>
