<p>If you wish to specify a flat amount as the price difference choose  this option and enter the flat amount in the <strong>Percentage/Amount</strong> field.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>The price difference is positive by default,  and hence will always be added to the selling price of the item being  upgraded. If you wish to have a negative value for price difference, so  that it is subtracted from the selling price of the upgraded/downgraded  item you must prefix the percentage or amount with a ‘-‘ (minus)  sign.</strong></p>
