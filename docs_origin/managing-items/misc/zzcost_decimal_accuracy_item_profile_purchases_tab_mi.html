<p>Specify a decimal accuracy of between 0 and 6 from the drop-down list.  This field is disabled if you select ‘fractional’ in the <strong>Quantity 
 Entry Method</strong> field of the measure. You can modify this field after  the item is used in a document. The decimal accuracy identifies the precision  with which the percentage of the measure’s base unit must be expressed.  All of the costs in the Purchase and Inventory tabs are based on this  cost decimal accuracy, except the Last Cost fields (Last Cost, Last Add-on  Cost, and Last Landed Cost) which always allow up to six decimal places.</p>

<p>The following can be entered in the cost decimal accuracy for the item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cost price  and the discount value in the purchase documents</li>
  <li>The cost in the  work order and inventory adjustment documents</li>
  <li>The cost in the  sales documents</li>
</ul>
