<p>An auto-serialized item can be tracked like a serialized item. To do  so:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assign the  manufacturer’s serial number to the item when purchasing it (from the  Purchase Order/Receipt/Invoice), or selling it (from the Sales Order or  Sales Invoice) or from the <strong>Serial Numbe</strong>r  profile.</li>
  <li>You can set  the flow control preference to your requirement. If the preference is  set to skip such items, auto-serialized items with the manufacturer’s  serial numbers will not be automatically assigned to a document. If preference  is set to prompt the user, <strong>Everest</strong>  will ask you whether the item with the manufacturer’s serial number has  to be attached to the sales document.</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, you can ensure that the item attached to the document is  identical to the one sold or returned.</p>
