<p>The total value of sales as displayed in the <strong>Sales 
 (qty)</strong> field divided by the total value of purchases as displayed  in the <strong>Purchase (qty)</strong> field is  displayed. This ratio indicates the percentage of the quantity purchased  that has been sold. A low ratio would lead to an inventory build up of  the item and indicates that sales do not meet expectations.</p>
