<p>Enter the markup percentage at which the item should be sold. For each  quantity level, you can specify a different percent markup. <strong>Everest</strong>  calculates the selling price of the item by marking up the cost of the  item with this percentage.</p>

<p class="example">The cost  of an item is $400. The special quantity pricing defined for the item  is that, if a customer buys 20 quantities of this item the cost will be  marked up by 10%.</p>

<p>In this case, the selling price is calculated as follows:400 * 10/ 100  = $40. This amount will be added to the cost price i.e., $400 + $40 =  $440. Therefore, when a customer buys 20 quantities of this item, it will  be sold at $440 per unit.</p>
