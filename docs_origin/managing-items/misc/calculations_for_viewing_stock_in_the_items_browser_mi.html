<p>*The <strong>Average Price</strong> is the same  as the <strong>Sell</strong> field under the <strong>Average Amounts</strong> group in the Item Summary  for the item (path: <strong>Items</strong> browser  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Summary</strong>  or press <strong>Ctrl + T</strong>). The system  calculates it as <strong>Sales (amount)</strong>  / <strong>Sales (qty in item stock measure)</strong>  under the <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Activities</strong>  group. See <a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/misc/the_item_summary_dialog_box.html">The Item Summary  Dialog Box</a> for detailed information.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>The <strong>Stock 
 Measure</strong> field shows the inventory unit of measure. You can also  locate the stock measure on the <strong>Inventory</strong>  tab of the <strong>Item</strong> profile. The <strong>Stock</strong> <strong>Measure</strong>  field is shown regardless of which <strong>View</strong>  menu option is selected for viewing stock.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Total 
 Stock</strong> and <strong>Available Stock</strong>  fields are stored in the stock measure up to 6 decimal places and converted,  using a conversion factor, to the default purchase or default sales measure.</li>
