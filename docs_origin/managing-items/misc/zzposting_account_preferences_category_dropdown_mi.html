<p>Specify an account selection methodology to be used for the  Category profile. You can specify accounts without setting up posting  groups. If you prefer to use posting groups (groups of accounts), instead  of making individual account selections, that option is also available.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Accounts Based Upon Hierarchy</strong> – Select this option if you would  like the system to use inventory accounts at the location level first  (if defined) and then at the company level (accounting defaults).</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Posting Groups</strong> – Select this option if you would like to use Posting  Groups to define your accounts. If you select this option, you must enter  an “Inventory Posting Group” in the <strong>Posting</strong><strong>Group</strong> field that appears when  you make this selection. 
Select a Posting Group to be associated with the category being defined.  All the Posting Groups of the type Inventory are available for selection.  This is not a mandatory field.
If no Posting Group is defined in these two profiles, the Posting Group  selected in the <strong>Location-Category</strong>  grid of the <strong>Location</strong> profile is  used.</li>
  <li>Specify  Accounts – Select this option if you  would like to specify the inventory control accounts to use for this Category.  Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/img/look_up_button_mi.gif" alt="" /> lookup button to view the related accounts that  can be defined. On the Accounts screen, select the Inventory Control Accounts  that you would like to define for this Category. Click Apply and then  click OK to apply your selections.</li>
