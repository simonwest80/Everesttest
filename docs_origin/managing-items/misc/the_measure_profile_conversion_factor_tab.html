<p>The value of stock computed when either the <strong>Fractional</strong>  or <strong>Decimal</strong> method is selected  is illustrated in the following example:</p>

<p class="example">If an item’s measure is a kilogram, and the base unit is 1000 grams,  2 and a half kilograms would be expressed as 2:500 under the fractional  method. The value of the quantity at a rate of $2 would be calculated  as follows:</p>

<p>2 * $2 + (500/1000)*$2</p>

<p>If the quantity is 2 kilograms and 500 grams and the decimal accuracy  is 3, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed as 2.500.</p>

<p>The value of the quantity would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>2.500*$2</p>
