<p>The following quantity columns are also displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On 
 Debit Committed</strong> - The quantity of returns that you expect to make  to the vendor on the particular debit order is displayed, for all stock  areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Pending</strong>  - The net quantity that has NOT yet been returned to the vendor is displayed.  Thus: Pending (quantity) = On Debit (quantity) - Shipped (quantity)</li>
  <li><strong>Shipped</strong>  - The quantity that has already been returned on the debit order is displayed.  This column displays a value if the document is on back order.</li>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Area</strong> - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.</li>
