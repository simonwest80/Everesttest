<p>The <strong>Pending Purchase</strong> <strong>Orders</strong>  browser displays a list of purchase orders that contain the selected item.  Purchase Orders are displayed with respect to each location that is added  to the <strong>Items</strong> browser. The details  of items that you expect to receive from vendors are thus provided.</p>

<p>Other purchase order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  terms, and due date are also displayed in the <strong>Pending 
 Purchase Orders</strong> browser.</p>

<p>The following quantity columns are also displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total 
 On Order</strong> - The quantity that has been ordered (irrespective of  whether it has been partly received or not) is displayed.</li>
  <li><strong>Pending 
 On Order</strong> - The quantity that has NOT yet been received on the order  is displayed. Thus:</li>
</ul>

<p>Pending Quantity = On Order (quantity)  - Received (quantity)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Received</strong> - The quantity that has already been received on the purchase order  is displayed. This column displays a value if the document is on back  order.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">All quantity fields are shown in the unit  of measure of the respective document.</p>
