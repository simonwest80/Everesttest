<p>You can import third party databases such as vendor’s or a competitor’s  catalogs, and browse for quick reference during the purchase or sales  cycles.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>Tech Data updates it’s electronics catalog  on monthly basis. By importing this catalog into **Everest</strong>,  your purchase department can see whether they sell a particular product,  and at what price. The sales department can also browse the catalog to  see if an item can be specially ordered by a customer. If a competitor’s  catalog is imported, the sales department can compare the selling price  of a product to theirs, and make a better offer to the customer.**</p>

<p>You have to define the third party catalog within <strong>Everest</strong>  so as to create the required structure based on which the data can be  imported. You can also add selected items from the third party catalogs  to your database. You can update the cost of the imported item, to make  the latest cost available to your customers.</p>
