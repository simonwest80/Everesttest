If  this option is checked when the item is retrieved into the sales order  but unchecked when the sales order is converted into sales invoice, the  force price on the sales order will be carried to the sales invoice. If  unchecked when the item is retrieved into the sales order but checked  when the sales order is converted into sales invoice, the force price  will not be relevant and the price on the sales order will be carried  to the sales invoice.</p>
