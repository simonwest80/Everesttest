  <dt>: If you set up the cost of shipping to be 90% of  its selling price, and you bill $200 for shipping on a document, the cost  of shipping is computed at $180 but the bill that you receive from your  carrier for this may differ.</dt>
  <dd>When the cost of an item is calculated using this  method, on sale an accounting entry is made for the notional cost by debiting  the expense account for the item and crediting the liability account defined  for the item in the Accounts tab of the Item profile.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Include in Commission Report Calculation</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box if sales commission is payable  to sales representatives on sales of the item being defined, and the item  is included for commissions. The commission due to sales representatives  is calculated by the <strong>Sales 
 Commission</strong> and <strong>Commission 
 (Quick Summary)</strong> reports (path: <strong>Reports

  <dt><strong>Tax inclusive selling price</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this option to include the amount of tax  applicable to the item in the selling price of the item. When the item  is sold, the price is computed using the formula:</dd>
  <dd>Item Price = Selling price of the item + Tax applicable.</dd>
  <dt>: If an item’s selling price is $110 which is inclusive  of 10% sales tax, the base selling price which accounts for the revenue  is $100.</dt>
  <dd>The purpose of arriving at this base selling price  is:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>: To identify  the revenues to be accounted.</li>
  <li>: To identify  the amount of tax payable to the Tax Authorities.</li>
  <li>: To compute  the discount, if any, on the base price rather than on the tax inclusive  price.</li>
  <li>: To compute  the commission payable to sales persons based on the revenues rather than  on the tax inclusive price.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>This option is not enabled for kit items.</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Include in Freight Calculation</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use this option to indicate whether the weight of  this item is to be included when estimating freight on a sales document  in which the item is included.</dd>
  <dd>You can enter the weight for computation of freight  on sales in the <strong>Weight</strong> field of  the <strong>Item Freight</strong> dialog box. Double-click  the <strong>Freight</strong> field in the <strong>Price Calculation</strong> section grid. Freight  is computed on sales only for items that have this option selected.</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="note">
  <li>If  this option is not checked for a complete kit, but is checked for the  items contained in the kit, the complete kit is not considered for freight  calculation. Freight is not calculated and charged.</li>
  <li>When this option  is checked for a kit, freight is calculated based on the total weight  of the kit, after excluding all items, which have this option unchecked.  The item weights are recalculated based on the quantity of items.</li>
</ul>

<dl class="example">
  <dt>If the freight calculation option is checked for a kit, and only  6  out of 8 items comprising the kit have the freight calculation option  checked, <strong>Everest</strong> considers only  the 6 items for calculating the document weight and applies the freight  rate for the document weight calculated.</dt>

  <dt><strong>Pack Separately</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box if the item has to be packed  separately while shipping. Freight is computed separately for each unit  of the item contained on sales and purchase documents.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">A sales invoice contains three line items, A, B and C.  Item A is marked as “pack separately” while items B and C  do not have this option selected. 10 units of Item A and 2 units each  of items B and C  are shipped. The number of packages in this case are 11 (10+1). Freight  is computed for each unit of item A separately.</p>

  <dt>This field is disabled if the **Item </dt>
  <dt> Type** selected in the <strong>General</strong>  tab of the <strong>Item</strong> profile is <strong>Kit</strong>. If this option is selected for  items that make up a kit, only those items will be packed separately.</dt>

  <dt><strong>Sales Price Decimal Accuracy</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the number of decimals between 0 and 6 to  be used for the sales price. The default sales price decimal accuracy  is the currency decimal accuracy. You can change the decimal accuracy  after the item is used in any document or pricing records are created.</dd>
  <dt><strong>If you decrease the decimal accuracy, the  pricing records do not change. They have to be updated manually.</strong></dt>
  <dd>All prices on the <strong>Sales</strong>  tab are based on the <strong>Sales Price Decimal 
 Accuracy</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note"><strong>All measures in the Item profile must have  the same Quantity Entry Method. This includes stock, sales, and purchase  measures. For serialized items, the stock measure is automatically selected  as the default sales measure and cannot be changed. You cannot select  additional sales measures for serialized items.</strong></p>

<p>The selling price of an item is the base price at which you sell the  item to your customer. The difference between the cost of the item (actual  cost in case of serialized inventory and average cost in case of non-serialized  inventory) and the selling price is your gross margin of profit. Use Item  pricing in Everest to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>: Select from  three different methods of price calculations.
    <ul>
      <li>: Specify different  prices for different customer levels.</li>
      <li>: Specify different  prices for different quantity levels.</li>
      <li>: Set up discount  schemes for the item based on quantity or customer.</li>
      <li>: Define promotional  schemes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul class="note">
  <li>Selling prices  set up in the <strong>Item</strong> profile can  be changed in individual sales documents.</li>
