<p>Use this option to enable lot tracking in <strong>Everest</strong>.  Non-serialized inventoried items that have been purchased from a vendor  or returned by a customer can be tracked easily by assigning numbers to  a batch or lot of items. These numbers that have been assigned are called  lot numbers. You can make lot tracking mandatory for the particular item  code by selecting the <strong>Use</strong> <strong>lot</strong> <strong>tracking</strong>  check box. An item must be lot tracked for details to display in the <strong>Lot History</strong> Browser.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> picks the starting sequence  for the lot number from the logged in location. If the sequence number  is blank in the login location the sequence number is picked from the  default or the main location.</p>
