<p>Use the <strong>Tax Inclusive Cost</strong> option  to specify that the vendor as displayed in the <strong>Item 
 Price</strong> column of purchase documents quote the cost of the item after  including the sales tax amount.</p>

<p>The tax on purchases may include Recoverable and Non-recoverable taxes.  If this option is selected, the recoverable portion of taxes is reduced  from the item cost (base price) and only includes the non-recoverable  portion.</p>
