<p>The <strong>Notes</strong> tab is provided in  the <strong>Item</strong> profile to enter additional  information about the item. Additional information can be any information  you would like to convey to the user who is processing a sale or purchase  transaction for a particular item.</p>

<p>Notes can also remind you of tasks that have to be done prior to proceeding  a transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Extended Purchase/Sales Description</strong></p>

<p>The notes specified in the <strong>Extended 
 purchase description</strong> and <strong>Extended 
 sales description</strong> sections are printed on purchase and sale documents  respectively.</p>

<p>In these sections, you can define additional information or tags such  as the user code and time that has to be retrieved into documents along  with the item.</p>

<p class="example">If you add %user%  to the <strong>Extended sales description</strong> section,  then when a sales document is being created, the item’s extended description  will also show the logged in user name.</p>

<p>This feature is especially useful in the  service industry.</p>

<p class="example">Create a non-inventoried item called “Tech”  and in extended description add the ‘user’ tag. When this item is retrieved  into a sales document the user that the item represents becomes apparent  since the user code of the logged in user is also retrieved.</p>

<p>The tags that can be included are:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Tag Name</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Date</td>
      <td>Current login date is retrieved into the document.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time</td>
      <td>Current time is retrieved into the document.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User</td>
      <td>Code of the logged in user is retrieved.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Item code</td>
      <td>Code of the item is retrieved.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Item description</td>
      <td>Description of the item is retrieved.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="steps">To add a tag to the extended purchase description section,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place the cursor  in the <strong>Extended purchase description</strong> section.</li>
  <li>Select the  required tag from the right-click menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly tags can be added to the <strong>Extended 
 sales description</strong> section.</p>
