<h1 id="item-matrix">Item Matrix</h1>

<p>This is a group of items with defined attributes. The items in a matrix  represent unique combinations of the available attributes, with minimal  cost variations. Sales of items of different combinations are based on  customer preferences.</p>

<p class="example">A 100% cotton branded shirt available in three sizes, two colors and  5 patterns is set up as a matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Item Matrix Wizard</strong> helps you  create item matrices.</p>

<p>When an item matrix is created, two types of items are created:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Matrix 
 Group</strong> - A master item with Matrix Group as the <strong>Item 
 Type</strong> to represent the item matrix.</li>
  <li><strong>Matrix 
 Item</strong> - Individual combinations of the item with <strong>Matrix 
 Item</strong> as the <strong>Item type</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Set up an item matrix when:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Your line of  business includes items that are sold in a variety of combinations with  minor price differences</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Garments and shoes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It would be  very cumbersome to set up each combination as an individual item. When  you set up an item matrix, <strong>Everest</strong>  automates the process of setting up individual combinations of the item.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If a garment is available in combinations  of 3 sizes, 3 colors and 3 patterns, the total number of items within  the matrix would be 27.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to  manage item stocks at the matrix level, the attribute level and the individual  item level.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you run a garment store, you would like  to know the total stock of Beefy Haynes  T-shirts, all the T-shirts in white color, and the total stock of the  red, striped T-shirt in the size ‘large’.</p>
