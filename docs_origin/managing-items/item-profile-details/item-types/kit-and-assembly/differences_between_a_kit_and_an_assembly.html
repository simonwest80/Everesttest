<ul>
  <li>Items that are components of a kit continue to form a part of their individual stocks until sale whereas items that are components of an assembly are reduced from their individual stocks during manufacture.</li>
  <li>Stocks of kits are not maintained, but an assembled item has its own inventory.</li>
  <li>When a kit is sold, all components of the kit are added to the sales document; when an assembly item is sold, it becomes a single item in the sales document.</li>
  <li>The composition of a kit can be altered at the time of sale; the composition of an assembly can be altered only during manufacture.</li>
</ul>
