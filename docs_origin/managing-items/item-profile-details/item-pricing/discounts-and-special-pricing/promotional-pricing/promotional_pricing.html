<p>Promotional pricing schemes are defined for a specific item for a specified  time period. Promotional pricing is used either for introductory offers  or for stock clearance.</p>

<p>You cannot create more than one promotional scheme for an item during  the same period.</p>

<p class="example">If you have defined a promotional price for Item A for the period December  25,   2007  to January 30, 2008, you cannot define another scheme for the same item  for the same period.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>Prices are applicable  to each unit of measure.</li>
  <li>Promotional Pricing  is not applicable to <strong>Everest eStorefront</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The various promotional pricing methods are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unit price  of $X - All units of the item are sold at $X during the specified period.</li>
  <li>Discount percent  - An item is sold at the stipulated discount during the specified period.</li>
</ul>
