<h1 id="the-quantity-pricing-dialog-box">The Quantity Pricing Dialog Box</h1>

<p>Use this dialog box to define the quantity pricing and markup values  you wish to use for this item/kit for each measure listed. When a measure  is selected in the sales document for an item, the quantity pricing defined  for that measure applies to the item.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Quantity</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the minimum quantity to be purchased by the  customer in order to receive the special pricing. You can define up to  5 different quantity levels. The quantity is in the decimal accuracy for  the sales measure.</dd>
  <dt><strong>% Markup</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the markup percentage at which the item should  be sold. For each quantity level, you can specify a different percent  markup. <strong>Everest</strong> calculates the  selling price of the item by marking up the cost of the item with this  percentage.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">You cannot specify zero (0) in this field. <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you to enter a value greater than zero.</p>

<p class="example">The cost of an item is $400. The special quantity pricing defined for  the item is that, if a customer buys 20 quantities of this item, the cost  is marked up by 10%.</p>

<p>In this case, the selling price is calculated as follows:400 * 10/100  = $40. This amount is added to the cost price i.e., $400 + $40 = $440.  Therefore, when a customer buys 20 quantities of this item, it is sold  at $440 per unit.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Price</strong></dt>
  <dd>To specify a fixed price (per measure) at which  the item has to be sold, specify the price in this column.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">You cannot specify zero (0) in this field. <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you to enter a value greater than zero.</p>

<p class="example">The selling price of the item ‘A’ is $100.  The special quantity pricing defined for the item is $90 per unit. It  is applicable only if a customer buys 20 quantities of this item.</p>

<p class="note">It is mandatory to define either a fixed price or a markup percentage  if you specify a quantity greater than zero in the <strong>Quantity</strong>  column.</p>

<p>You cannot define both fixed price and markup percentage for a certain  quantity of an item.</p>
