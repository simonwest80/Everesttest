<p>Average Cost is the current weighted average cost of the item. The weighted  average cost of the item is computed by adding the value of a purchase  to the value of quantity in stock and dividing the sum by the sum of the  quantity in stock and quantity purchased.</p>

<p>Average cost is thus computed using the following formula:</p>

<p>Average Cost = (Value of Purchase + Value of Quantity in Stock)/ (Quantity  purchased + Quantity in Stock)</p>

<p class="example">You buy 100 of item A at $10. The value of  the quantity of stock is $1000. The weighted average cost of item A will  be $10. You buy another 50 of item A at $11. The weighted average cost  of item A is now $10.33.</p>

<p>The average cost is used for computing selling price of the item where  the calculation method for the item is based on average cost.</p>

<p>If the item is a non-serialized inventoried item, the cost of goods  sold that is debited to the Cost of Goods Sold account is computed at  average cost by multiplying the quantity sold by average cost at the time  of sale. Average cost also includes factor costs if applicable.</p>

<p class="note">All the costs referred  to here are the costs per purchase measure and not the costs per</p>

<p>unit.</p>

<p>In the case of non-inventoried items, the <strong>Average 
 Cost</strong> field in <strong>Item</strong> profile  is the last cost of the item.</p>

<p>The average cost in the <strong>Factor Cost</strong>  section indicates the average cost inflated by the factor percentage or  amount.</p>
