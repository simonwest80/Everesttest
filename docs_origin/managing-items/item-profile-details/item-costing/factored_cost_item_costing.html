<h1 id="factored-cost">Factored Cost</h1>

<p>Factored costs are the item’s last cost and average cost inflated by  the specified percentage.</p>

<p class="example">If the actual last cost and average cost are  $100 and $105, and the cost factor percent is 10, the factored last cost  and factored average cost are $110 and $115.50.</p>

<p>When costs are factored and the item’s selling price has to be calculated  based on cost, the sales price is calculated using the factored cost.  If sales commission is payable based on profits, the profit is computed  by deducting factored costs from the sales price.</p>

<p class="note">The factored last cost of a Kit is not updated when there is a change  in the last cost of any of the items that comprise the Kit. None of the  related fields in the <strong>Purchase</strong>  tab of the <strong>Item</strong> profile are automatically  updated for kit items. The kit’s last cost has to be manually updated  to reflect the changes in the last cost of component items.</p>
