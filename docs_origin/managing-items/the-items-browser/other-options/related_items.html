<p>Related items represent items that can be sold or purchased as substitutes  or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item.</p>

<p>Upgrading an item can be defined as selling/purchasing an enhanced version  of an existing product.</p>

<p>Downgrading an item can be defined as selling /purchasing a product  that has fewer features than an existing product.</p>

<p>The <strong>Related</strong> <strong>Items</strong>  feature in <strong>Everest</strong> allows you  to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define multiple  upgrades or downgrades for an item. You can also define multiple related  items with the same item code but with different sales measures.</li>
  <li>Specify Price  Differentials for the upgrades or downgrades (indicate a fixed price or  a formula as the upgrade price, that will enable you to arrive at a new  price for the upgraded item).</li>
  <li>Assign upgrades/downgrades  and their price differentials to specific item kits.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>While adding items to the document, if there  is not enough stock, the **Related</strong><strong>Items</strong> browser will be automatically  displayed prompting you to select a related item as replacement. The prompt  will occur only if you have set up related items. You will have to set  the preference under <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts &gt; Sales 
 Document &gt; Sales Document 2</strong> tab for prompting the user to select  related items for items not available in stock.**</p>

<p>Related items also apply to Matrix Groups and kits.</p>
