<p>The <strong>Custom Fields</strong> feature in  <strong>Everest</strong> provides the ability to  track records based on user-defined fields. Custom fields are available  for item, vendor, customer and serial number profiles, contact manager  tasks as well as all documents. They can be a character string, a date  field, a logical field or a numeric field. Up to four custom fields can  be displayed in the associated browser.</p>

<p class="example">In an item’s profile, you might want to maintain a record of the item’s  color, texture, or expiry  date.</p>

<p>When you select this option the <strong>Custom 
 Fields - Item</strong> profile is displayed. You can enter data in the custom  fields for the selected item. You can also add or modify custom fields  setup for items.</p>
