<p>Inventory adjustments are the adjustments made to the book values of  items in stock in terms of cost and quantity to reflect the actual values  or quantities of the stock.  The  inventory option has the following sub-menu options:</p>

<p><strong>Stock Transfer -</strong> Stock transfer  normally takes place to correct demand and supply imbalances within the  company.</p>

<p class="example">An item that is slow moving in a certain distribution center is moved  to an area where it is in demand.</p>

<p>Stock transfers are also required to segregate old or damaged stock,  stocks to be exchanged or repaired, and stocks nearing obsolescence from  the other stocks.</p>
