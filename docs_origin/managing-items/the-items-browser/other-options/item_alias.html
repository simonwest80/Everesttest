<p>Items can have multiple aliases or alternatives assigned. Aliases provide  alternative methods for finding item codes. You can also assign alternative  descriptions and selling prices, when the item is retrieved into a document  using the alias specified.</p>

<p>To use aliases to search for items, they must be defined as one of the  search methods in the <strong>Alternative Search 
 Sequence when an item Code is not found</strong> section of the <strong>Items</strong>  dialog box.</p>

<p>This feature is used when you don’t want to maintain multiple item codes,  but you want to use an alternate description or price on documents on  a regular basis. Although descriptions and prices can be changed on a  line item based on documents, it is easier to define an item alias if  these changes are made regularly.</p>

<p>Using item aliases can be extremely helpful when selling to a regular  customer like the government, and the description on your invoice needs  to exactly match their purchase order and include their part number. This  permits referencing an item by the manufacturer or distributor’s part  number as well as by your own part number.</p>
