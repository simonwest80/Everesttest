<h1 id="split-and-merge-a-matrix-group">Split and Merge a Matrix Group</h1>

<p>It is also possible to split a matrix group, and merge some  matrix items from an existing matrix group to another matrix group.</p>

<p class="example">You have a matrix group with the attributes  Color and Size. Colors available are Red, Blue and Plaid. Plaid products  are in style and you want to promote them by separating them into a distinct  matrix group that has only Plaid color products. The existing matrix group  with Red and Blue colors will remain, and you will have a distinct Plaid  matrix group. You can put this in a custom tracking group that allows  shoppers to find it more easily on your web store also.</p>

<p><strong>Points to remember</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You must have a  New matrix group already defined to merge the matrix items that you split  out of the existing matrix group.</li>
  <li>The New matrix  group must have undefined element combinations available to merge the  split matrix items.</li>
  <li>These unselected  matrix items must have the same number of attributes as the matrix items  that you wish to merge into the matrix group.</li>
  <li><strong>Everest</strong>  does not allow you to duplicate item codes or element combinations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">To split a matrix group, copy an existing  matrix group, delete unwanted elements and merge the remaining items into  a new matrix group with a new code and prefix or merge matrix items into  another matrix group.</p>
