<h1 id="statutory-forms">Statutory Forms</h1>

<p><strong>The statutory forms are the reports required  by the Federal Government. The Federal Government specifies the format  of these forms<font face="Verdana" class="hcp2">.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong>**Everest 
 US Payroll</strong> provides the following statutory forms<font face="Verdana" class="hcp2">:</font>**</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-w2/form_w2_sfr.html">Form  W2</a> - Annual Wage and Tax Statement</li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-w3/form_w3_sfr.html">Form  W3</a> - Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements</li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-940/form_940_sfr.html">Form  940</a> - Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment</li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-941/form_941_sfr.html">Form  941</a> - Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">For the W2, W3, 940 and 941 statutory forms,  we do not maintain formats specific to each year in <strong>Everest</strong>,  as that would be too cumbersome in terms of maintaining numerous templates  and the respective calculations. If you print a form for any of the previous  years, the data for that year displays in the latest IRS format.</p>
