<p>The US payroll reports refer to the statutory forms that the company  has to file with the Federal Government and the reports that you generate  every year to analyze payroll.</p>

<p>Reports can be broadly categorized into two kinds based on their function<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">: </font></p>

</ul>

<p class="note">The legal name of the company entered in the  <strong>Company 
 Creation Wizard</strong> is displayed on all reports generated from  <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>Almost all the payroll reports are based on the transaction date irrespective  of their posted or unposted status, and whether the checks for these transactions  are printed or not. The following reports, however, consider only those  transactions for which checks have been printed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Form W2</li>
  <li>Form W3</li>
  <li>Form 940</li>
  <li>Form 941</li>
  <li>Withholdings report</li>
  <li>Pay Stubs report</li>
</ul>

<p>To match these reports with the transactions, print all the checks before  generating the above reports.</p>

<p class="example">You are generating a <strong>Withholdings</strong>  report for Employee A. Employee A has had five transactions where the  amount withheld in each transaction is $5000. Checks are printed for only  the first two transactions. When the <strong>Withholdings</strong>  report is generated, it  displays  the amount withheld as $10,000 (Total of the amount withheld for two transactions)  instead of $25,000 (Actual total of all the five transactions). To avoid  this discrepancy, it is advisable to print checks for all the transactions  before generating the report.</p>
