<p>A supplemental payroll is run in addition to the regular payroll to make additional payments to the employees irrespective of which payroll period they belong to. When you process a supplemental payroll transaction, the transaction records are displayed in the <strong>Payroll Transactions</strong> browser.</p>

<p>Supplemental payroll allows you to make additional payments, or contributions or deductions without having to wait for a regular pay date.</p>
