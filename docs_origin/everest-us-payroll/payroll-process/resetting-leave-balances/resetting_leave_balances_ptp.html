<p>You can reset the vacation and sick leave balances of the employees  to zero at the beginning of every calendar year, if you do not want to  carry over them.</p>

<p>Only the leave balances of the employees for whom you have selected  the options <strong>Reset sick every year</strong>  and <strong>Reset vacation every year</strong>  in the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>Employee</strong> profile (path: <strong>Payroll 
 &gt; Employees &gt; Employee Data</strong> &gt; from the <strong>Employees</strong>  browser, double-click the required record) are set to zero.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the option <strong>Reset sick every year</strong>  is not selected for an employee in the <strong>Employee</strong>  profile, the sick leave balance of that employee will not be set to zero,  when you reset the leave balance.</p>

<p class="steps">To reset sick and vacation leave balances,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Payroll &gt; Reset Leave 
 Balance</strong>. You will see the <strong>Confirmation</strong>  window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to reset the sick and vacation leave  balances to zero.</li>
</ul>
