  <dt><strong>Transactions Grid</strong></dt>
  <dd>Transaction grid in this browser displays details  of each transaction such as transaction number, pay date, take home pay  etc. Amount of payment is the take home pay and it cannot be edited.</dd>
  <dd>If you want to generate a computer check, select  the option <strong>Computer Check</strong>. Leave  this option unchecked to make a manual payment, where check is written  out by hand or a wire transfer etc.</dd>
  <dd>If you are making a manual payment, you need to  enter the reference number for payment in the <strong>Check 
 #</strong> column. For a manual payment, you can also specify the check  date in the <strong>Check Date</strong> column.  The <strong>Check #</strong> and <strong>Check

  <dd>Employees with a take home pay of  $0.00  are also listed in this browser.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/hint.gif" alt="" />  You  can create payroll payment journals even when an employee’s take home  pay is nil in order to record the payroll transaction and generate statutory  forms and pay stubs.</dd>
  <dd>For such transactions, you cannot print computer  checks. You must enter the check number and date in the <strong>Reference 
 #</strong> and <strong>Reference Date</strong> fields.  When you select this transaction for payment, accounting entries are not  created for the same. However, the transaction is marked as paid in the  back end.</dd>
