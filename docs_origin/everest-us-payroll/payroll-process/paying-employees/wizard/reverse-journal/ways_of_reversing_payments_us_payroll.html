<p><strong>Everest US Payroll</strong> allows you  to reverse the payments created for a particular transaction record. You  may need to reverse payment records to rectify errors in payments.</p>

<p>Reversal entries are required to nullify the accounting effect of the  original payment entry. The original payment entry is a system entry and  cannot be deleted; hence, it is marked as “Reversed” and a reversal payment  entry is created.  A  Reversal payment entry is also required for audit trails.</p>

<p>Using the following options available from the <strong>Reverse 
 Payments</strong> browser (path: <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>US Payroll</strong> &gt; <strong>Payments</strong>  &gt; <strong>Reverse Payment</strong>), you can  either permanently remove the payroll payment  transaction  or recreate a new one:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purge - This option  allows you to permanently delete the payroll payment transaction. Use  this option for computerized checks that are not printed or for zero amount  payroll transactions.</li>
  <li>Reverse Payment  - Use this option to reverse and recreate a payroll payment that has a  check number assigned.  When  you select this option, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a reversal payment entry for the original transaction, and an  new payment entry to recreate it. The reversed and recreated payroll entry  will appear in this browser itself.</li>
</ul>
