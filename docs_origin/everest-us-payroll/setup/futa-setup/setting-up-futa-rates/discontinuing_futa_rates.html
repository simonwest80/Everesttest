<p>When you discontinue a <strong>FUTA Setup</strong>  dialog box, it is temporarily unavailable for selection. The record is  not deleted from the database, it is merely deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue FUTA rates, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Payroll &gt; Federal 
 Taxes &gt; FUTA</strong>. You will see the <strong>FUTA 
 Setup</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  record you want to discontinue.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>FUTA Setup</strong> browser, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will see the <strong>Confirm</strong>  window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to discontinue.</li>
