<p>US Payroll calculates the taxable amount or the base for each tax based  on the current taxability for the employee and displays these amounts.  You can edit the information, if required.</p>

<p class="note">Ensure that changes to the taxable amounts  are made only after you have entered all earnings and deductions. If you  change the taxable amount and then make modifications to the amounts of  earnings or deductions, then <strong>Everest</strong>  will recalculate the taxable amount and you will lose the changes made  to the taxable amounts.</p>

<p>The amounts that you specify in the taxes withheld columns are summarized  and displayed in the <strong>Withholdings</strong>  field.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Before saving the history, ensure that the take home pay calculated  and displayed in the <strong>General</strong> tab  is correct.</dt>
