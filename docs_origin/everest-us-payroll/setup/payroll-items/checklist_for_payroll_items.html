<p>It will be useful, if you make a checklist of the following before setting up payroll items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare a list of all types of addition, deductions and company contributions.</li>
  <li>Prepare a list of fringe benefits given to your employees.</li>
  <li>Prepare a list of third party payments made to your employees (although these items are not  added to the employee’s paycheck, they may have to be considered for withholding taxes).</li>
</ul>
