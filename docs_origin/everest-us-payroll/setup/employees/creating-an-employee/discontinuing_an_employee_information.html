<p>When you discontinue an employee, it is temporarily unavailable for  selection. The record is not deleted from the database, it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by activating  it again.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue an employee, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Payroll &gt; Employees 
 &gt; Employee Data</strong>. You will see the <strong>Employees</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  record you want to discontinue.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Employees</strong> browser, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will see the <strong>Confirm</strong>  window.</li>
