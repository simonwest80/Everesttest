<p><strong>Vacation Accrual</strong> - An employee is eligible to avail vacation leave for a particular number of hours for every pay period that the employee works.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If an employee is paid semi-monthly and is eligible for 78 hours of vacation leave a year, then 3 hours are added to the employee’s vacation leave balance every pay period<font face="verdana">.</font></p>

<p>The employee may utilize the vacation hours at a future date but the vacation hours are earned in the current pay period. The vacation pay paid to the employee when they were utilized is an expense that belongs to the period in which they were earned and not the period in which they were utilized.</p>

<p>Most companies accrue liability for vacation hours that are earned in the current pay period but may be availed at a future date. Payroll items set up for accruing the value of vacation leave earned in a pay period are <strong>Vacation Accrual</strong> type of items.</p>

<p><strong>Everest US Payroll</strong> automatically calculates the number of vacation hours earned by an employee in a pay period. The vacation accrual item identifies the payroll item and the accounts that must be credited or debited with the value of the vacation hours earned.</p>

<p><strong>Other Accruals</strong> - The pay type of all payroll items other than sick and vacation accruals is Other Accruals.</p>
