<p><strong>Everest US Payroll</strong> allows you to define new payroll items as per your requirements. Unlike default payroll items, the user-defined items are applicable only to the specific employee for whom the payroll item has been defined. Bonus, special allowances etc., are examples of user-defined payroll items.</p>
