<p>Illustration 2 pertains to cases where a payroll item, which is not  taxable to social security, is tracked to Box 7, for instance, Social  Security tips.</p>

<p>As a result, when Form W2 is generated, Box 7 shows the data for taxable  and non-taxable tips, while Box 4 displays the social security tax withheld  on the taxable tips and wages only. Box 3 is calculated after considering  the upper limit with the taxable tips only.</p>

<p>In such a scenario, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you that the figures in Boxes 3 and 7 may not be correct.</p>

<p>The data in Box 3 is displayed after validating the upper limit and  considering only the taxable portion of tips. Once the upper limit is  reached, Box 3 retains its value while Box 7 continues to increase with  subsequent transactions by considering the non-taxable portion of the  tips also. You can either save this form and close it or close it without  saving, so that you can make changes to the <strong>W2 
 Tracking</strong> profile (path: <strong>US Payroll 
 &gt; Setup &gt; W2 Tracking</strong>).</p>

<p>Box 7 is tracked to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tips 1, which is  taxable</li>
  <li>Tips 2, which is  non-taxable</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Values for Transaction 1, 2 and 3</td>

      <td>$85,000 (30000 + 20000 + 15000 +20000) where 15000 pertains to taxable  tips and 20,000 pertains to the non taxable tips</td>
      <td>$85,000 (30000 + 20000 + 15000 +20000 +20000) where the last 20,000  refers to the non-taxable tips of the 3rd transaction</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In cases where Box 7 is tracked to non-taxable payroll items, you can  make changes to Box 3 and/or Box 7. <strong>Everest</strong>  once again validates the upper limit of the social security wages and  asks you to make the required changes in case you have exceeded the upper  limit.</p>

<p class="note">When <strong>Everest</strong>  calculates the figures for box 3 and Box 7, it considers only the taxable  portion of Box 7. If you make adjustments to either Box 3 or Box 7, it  takes into account both the taxable and non-taxable items for validations.</p>
