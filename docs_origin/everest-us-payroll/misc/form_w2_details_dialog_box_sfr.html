<h1 id="form-w2-details---dialog-box">Form W2 Details - Dialog Box</h1>

<p>Use this dialog box to make adjustments to the values specified in Form  W2.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter a short description about the adjustment being  made in this field.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">If the employee has received an additional  amount of $500 as third party tip, you can enter Third Party in the <strong>Description</strong> field and $500 in the <strong>Amount</strong> field.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the amount to be adjusted in this field. To  deduct the amount from the total in the form, prefix the amount with a  minus (-) sign.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Delete</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use this button to cancel the adjustment to a particular  field. If you want to cancel the adjustment, click the field for which  you made the adjustment, select the entry and click the <strong>Delete</strong>  button.</dd>
  <dd>The <strong>Delete</strong>  button is enabled when you save the adjustment.</dd>
  <dt><strong>OK</strong></dt>
  <dd>Click <strong>OK</strong> to  save the adjustment made to a specific field and return to the <strong>Employee 
 Form W2</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">When you save the <strong>Employee</strong> Form W2, US Payroll saves the adjustments made to each box. When  you recreate the form for an employee (assume that more transactions are  added for the employee), US Payroll does <em>**</em> not overwrite the adjustments.</p>

<p>You must save all Form W2s issued to your employees,  to  create an accurate Form W3 report, which is a summary of all Form W2s.</p>

<p class="example">Assume that for an employee, the value in  Box 1 is $5000 and the adjustment is $500. Therefore, the value of Box  1 is $5500. If another transaction is added to the employee’s details  for $1000, and you</p>

<p>recreate Form W2 for the employee, the value  in box 1 is $6000; but US Payroll keeps track of the adjustment and displays  the total value of Box 1 as $6500 ($5000 +500+1000).</p>
