<h1 id="deductions">Deductions</h1>

<p>‘Deductions’ are the amounts that are deducted from an employee’s pay.  The deduction could be a voluntary deduction or mandated by legal decrees.</p>

<p class="example">Insurance premium is a voluntary deduction  whereas child support payments may be a deduction arising from a court’s  decree.</p>

<p>‘Deductions’ result in a liability to the company. The amounts deducted  have to be remitted by the employer to the organization responsible for  its collection.</p>

<p class="example">Insurance premium deducted is remitted to  the insurance company specified by the employee.</p>
