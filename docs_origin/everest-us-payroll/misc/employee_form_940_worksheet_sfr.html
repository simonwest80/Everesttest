<p>This is the two-letter abbreviation for the state(s) to which you are  required to pay contributions (including the District of Columbia, Puerto  Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).</p>

<p>Enter the beginning date of the experience rate.</p>

<p>Enter the ending date of the experience rate.</p>

<p>Enter the state experience rate, that is, the rate of the state assigned  to you for paying your state unemployment tax.

<p><strong>Everest</strong> displays the value arrived  at by subtracting the state experience rate, that is, the column (d) from  0.054.</p>

<p>Enter the taxable state wages on which you must pay SUTA for each state  shown in the column (a).</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> displays the value arrived  at by multiplying the amount in column (e) by column (f). The same amount  will be displayed in the line 3 Total and this is editable.</p>

<p>Enter the value arrived at by subtracting the line 4 from line 1 in  the line 5a.</p>

<p>Enter the amount paid late as state unemployment tax.</p>

<h1 id="form-940---worksheet">Form 940 - Worksheet</h1>

<p>Use the worksheet tab to figure your credit step by step.</p>

<p class="note">Do not complete the worksheet if line 9 applied  to you.</p>

<p><strong>Before you can properly fill out the 
 worksheet, gather the following information:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Taxable FUTA wages  (from line 7 of Form 940),</li>
  <li>Taxable state unemployment  wages,</li>
  <li>The experience  rates assigned to you by the states where you paid wages,</li>
  <li>The amount of state  unemployment taxes you paid on time (On time means that you paid the state  unemployment taxes by the due date for filing Form 940.), and</li>
  <li>The amount of state  unemployment taxes you paid late. (Late means after the due date for filing  Form 940.)</li>
</ul>

<p class="warn">Do not include any penalties, interest, or  unemployment taxes deducted from your employees’ pay in the amount of  state unemployment taxes. Also, do not include as state unemployment taxes  any special administrative taxes or voluntary contributions you paid to  get a lower assigned experience rate or any surcharges, excise taxes,  or employment and training taxes. (These items are generally listed as  separate items on the state’s quarterly wage report.)</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>1. Maximum allowable credit</strong></dt>
  <dd><strong>Everest</strong>  displays the value arrived at by multiplying the line 7 by 0.054. This  is the maximum credit against FUTA tax for state contributions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Compute your credit:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>2. Credit for timely state unemployment tax payments  – How much did you pay on time?</strong></dt>
  <dd>Based on the following two options, you can continue  to fill out the worksheet:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>If line 2 is  equal to or more than line 1, no need to continue the worksheet. You have  completed the worksheet. Leave line 10 of Form 940 blank.</li>
  <li>If line 2 is  less than line 1, continue the worksheet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Before filling line 
 3 of the worksheet:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>: If any of the  experience rates assigned to you were less than 5.4% for any part of the  calendar year, you must list each assigned experience rate separately  on the worksheet.
    <ul>
      <li>: If you were  assigned six or more experience rates that were less than 5.4% for any  part of the calendar year, you must use another sheet to figure the additional  credits and then include those additional credits in your line 3 total.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>: After you complete the worksheet, enter the amount  from line 7 of the worksheet on line 10 of Form 940. Do not attach the  worksheet to your Form 940. Keep it with your records.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>3.  Additional credit — Were ALL of your assigned experience rates 5.4% or  more?</strong></dt>
  <dd>Based on the following two options, you can continue  to fill out the worksheet:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>If yes, enter  zero on line 3. Then go to line 4 of this worksheet.</li>
  <li>If no, fill  out the computations below. List ONLY THOSE STATES for which your assigned  experience rate for all or part of the calendar year was less than 5.4%.</li>
