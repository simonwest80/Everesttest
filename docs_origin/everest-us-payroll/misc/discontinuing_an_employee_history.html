<p>When you discontinue a particular employee history, it is temporarily  unavailable for selection. The record is not deleted from the database,  it is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available  for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/note.gif" alt="" />  If  you discontinue a history transaction and create a regular payroll transaction  for the same payroll period, the discontinued record cannot be reactivated.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue an employee history, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Payroll &gt; Employees</strong>  &gt; <strong>Employee History</strong>. You will  see the <strong>Employee History</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  record you want to discontinue.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Employee History</strong> browser, select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will see  the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to discontinue the specific information.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you discontinue a historical transaction,  subsequent payroll transactions that would have calculated taxes on the  year to date amounts including the historical amounts, would now be wrong.  <strong>Everest</strong> displays a warning if  you discontinue a historical transaction of an employee who has payroll  transactions that are processed after the historical pay date, in the  same calendar year.</p>

<p>You can choose whether or not to discontinue  this transaction by clicking <strong>Yes</strong>  or <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Everest</strong>  also logs an event if you choose to discontinue such historical transactions.</dt>
