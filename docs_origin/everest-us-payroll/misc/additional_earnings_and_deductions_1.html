<p>The <strong>Additional Earnings and Deductions</strong>  grid displays all payroll items of type Additions, Deductions, Contributions  and Accruals, set up for the employee.</p>

 Pay</strong> are increased.</p>

<p>You have to enter the base amount and amount of payment for each payroll  item in this grid.</p>
