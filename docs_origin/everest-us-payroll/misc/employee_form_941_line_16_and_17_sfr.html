<p>If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period,  you are a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit  Rule discussed in section 11 of Pub. 15 (Circular E) applies.</p>

<p>You are a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the taxes  reported on Form 941 for the lookback period are $50,000 or less.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/note.gif" alt="" /> The lookback  period constitutes the four consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of  the prior year. For 2007, the lookback period begins July 1, 2005, and  ends June 30, 2006. For details on the deposit rules, see section 11 of  Pub. 15 (Circular  E).</p>

<p>If you reported more than $50,000 of taxes for the lookback period,  you are a semiweekly schedule depositor.</p>

<p>You must complete Schedule B (Form 941) and submit it with your Form  941. Do not use Schedule B (Form 941) if you are a monthly schedule depositor.</p>
