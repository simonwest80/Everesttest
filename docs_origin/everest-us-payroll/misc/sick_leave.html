  <dt><strong>Sick hours credited for the pay period</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field displays the number of sick hours credited  to the employee’s account for the specified pay period. You can reduce  the value in this field, if the employee has earned less number of leaves  in the pay period.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">The number of sick hours credited for the  pay period is derived by dividing the total number of sick hours for a  calendar year by the number of payroll periods in a year. If the balance  of hours in the employee’s account exceeds the maximum balance specified  in the <strong>Employee</strong> profile, the hours  credited are reduced to ensure that the balance is restricted to the maximum  balance.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Amount accrued for the sick hours</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field denotes the amount that is accrued for  sick hours. This amount is calculated by multiplying the number of hours  credited to the employee’s leave account with the sick hour rate specified  in the <strong>Employee</strong> profile. This  field cannot be edited.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Balance of Sick Hours</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field displays an employee’s total balance  of sick hours accrued from the beginning of the year to the current pay  period. This is derived by deducting the availed sick hours from the total  sick hours that the employee is entitled from the beginning of the year  till the current pay period.</dd>
  <dd>If the balance of sick hours is negative, you will  be prompted of the same when you save the transaction.</dd>
