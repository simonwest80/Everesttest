<h1 id="calculation-type">Calculation Type</h1>

<p>The calculation type identifies how the local tax is calculated. The  calculation types can be any one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>% 
 of Federal</strong> - The local tax is calculated as a percentage of the  federal income tax of the employee.</li>
  <li><strong>% 
 of State</strong> - The local tax is calculated as a percentage of the state  income tax of the employee.</li>
  <li><strong>% 
 of Gross</strong> - The local tax is calculated as a percentage of the gross  salary of the employee.</li>
  <li><strong>% 
 of Net Salary</strong> - The local tax calculated as a percentage of net  salary of the employee.</li>
  <li><strong>Flat 
 Amount</strong> - You are required to specify a flat amount to be deducted  from the employee’s earnings.</li>
  <li><strong>Based 
 on the Hours Worked</strong> - The local tax is calculated at a rate based  on the number of hours worked by the employee.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">For the calculation type set to % of Gross  or % of Net Salary, the local tax is calculated in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Min1 = Minimum  of (Local Tax Taxable amount) or (Local Tax Taxable amount + <a href="javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)" id="a1">Year to date</a><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a1');
//--></script>  - Lower Limit set in the <strong>Local Tax</strong>  profile)</li>
  <li>Min2 = Minimum  of (Taxable amount) or (Upper Limit set in the <strong>Local 
 Tax</strong> profile - Year to date)</li>
  <li>Min3 = Upper Limit  - Lower Limit set in the <strong>Local Tax</strong>  profile</li>
</ul>

<p>If Lower Limit and Upper Limit are greater  than zero, the least of Min1, Min2 and Min3 is considered to calculate  the Local tax. Local tax is calculated as a percentage of Net Pay/Gross  Pay.</p>

<p>If Upper Limit is greater than zero, <strong>Everest</strong> calculates Min1 amount, as stated  above, to arrive at the Local Tax amount.</p>

<p>If Lower Limit is greater than zero, <strong>Everest</strong> calculates Min2 amount, as stated  above, to arrive at the Local Tax amount.</p>
