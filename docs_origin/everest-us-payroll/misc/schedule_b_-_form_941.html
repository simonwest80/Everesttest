<h1 id="schedule-b---form-941">Schedule B - Form 941</h1>

<p>Schedule B (Form 941) is used to report the tax liability of an employer  on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Tax Liability = Income tax withheld + Social Security (employee and  employer) + Medicare Taxes (employee and employer) - Advance earned income  credit payments</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Depositors</strong>: You are  a federal monthly depositor if your company’s federal tax liability during  the lookback  period was less than $50,000. This is why all new employers are monthly  depositors. Monthly depositors pay taxes for a given month by the 15th  of the next month.</p>

<p class="example">Taxes for the month of June are due by July  15th. However, if the 15th falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the due  date is deferred to the next banking day.</p>

<p><strong>Semiweekly Depositors</strong>: If your  lookback liability  is greater than $50,000, you are a semi-weekly depositor. You pay taxes  on three banking days after the end of any semi-weekly period in which  you accrued a liability. The IRS divides the week into two periods: (1)  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and (2) Saturday, Sunday, Monday and  Tuesday. Taxes accrued during the Wednesday-Friday period are due on the  following Wednesday, and taxes accrued during the Saturday-Tuesday period  are due on the following Friday. In some cases, when a bank holiday occurs  during the week, you are granted an extra day to make the tax payment.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the Deposit Schedule Rules</p>

<p>There are two main exceptions to the monthly and semi-weekly tax deposit  requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Next-Day 
 Deposit Rule</strong>: If you accrue $100,000 or more in federal tax liability  at any point during a deposit period, you must remit taxes on the next  banking day. This could result from a single payroll, or it could result  from multiple payrolls within a single deposit period (month or semi-week).</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you are a monthly depositor and pay a one-time  bonus to employees that results in more than $100,000 in liability on  a single day, you must pay the amount due immediately. You also become  a semiweekly depositor until your lookback  liability falls below the $50,000 threshold again.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Quarterly 
 Exemption</strong>: If your federal tax liability is less than $2,500 for  a quarter, regardless of your deposit schedule, there is an option of  paying taxes due with your tax filing at the end of the quarter, instead  of making deposits during the quarter.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Schedule B must also be used by semiweekly  schedule depositors who file Form 941-SS, Employer’s Quarterly Federal  Tax Return (for American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands).</p>
