<p>Check box b if you are a successor employer and you are reporting wages  paid before you acquired the business by a predecessor who was required  to file a Form 940 because the predecessor was an employer for FUTA tax  purposes, or you are claiming a special credit for state unemployment  tax paid before you acquired the business by a predecessor who was not  required to file a Form 940 because the predecessor was not an employer  for FUTA tax purposes.</p>

<p>A successor employer is an employer who acquires substantially all the  property used in a trade or business of another person (predecessor) or  used in a separate unit of a trade or business of a predecessor, and immediately  after the acquisition, employs one or more people who were employed by  the predecessor.</p>
