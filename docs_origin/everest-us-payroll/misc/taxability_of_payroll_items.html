<h1 id="taxability-of-payroll-items">Taxability of Payroll Items</h1>

<p>All payroll items are not taxed uniformly. The payroll item taxability  identifies the taxes that are payable on the payroll item. You will have  to specify the taxes applicable to each payroll item.</p>

<p>Amounts for payroll items of type <strong>a</strong><strong>ddition</strong> or <strong>Company</strong><strong>Contribution</strong> that are not taxable  are not added to the taxable wage base for computing the tax.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If the company contribution  to a 401K plan is not taxable to federal income tax, and an employee earns  $5000 as salary and the company contributes $150 towards a 401 K  plan, then the federal income tax is calculated on $5000 only.</p>

<p>A deduction that is not taxable will result in a reduction in the taxable  wage base for the tax.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> The salary of an employee  is taxable to federal income tax but an employee’s contribution to a 401  K plan is not  taxed. In this case, if an employee earns $4000 as salary and makes a  contribution of $500, then the federal income tax would be calculated  on $3500. In effect, the employee gets a tax rebate on the deduction.</p>

<p>The taxability of a payroll item could differ at the employee level,  if the employee’s filing state and local taxes differ from the state and  the taxes defined in the <strong>Employee Template</strong>.</p>

<p>Payroll Items Grid</p>

<p>All payroll items that are set up in the <strong>Employee 
 Template</strong> are listed in the grid beside the <strong>Payroll</strong><strong>Item Type</strong> field. You can include  a new payroll item in the employee’s pay package by inserting it into  the grid.</p>

<p>To view payroll items of a particular type listed in the grid, you need  to specify the type of your choice in the <strong>Payroll 
 item type</strong> field.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> Select <strong>Accruals</strong>,  to view the payroll items of type accrual in the grid.</p>

<p>To view all types of payroll items that are set up for an employee,  you will have to select <strong>All</strong> in  the <strong>Payroll Item Type</strong> field.</p>

<p>You will have to specify the federal, state and local taxes that are  applicable to each payroll item by selecting the respective check boxes.  To exempt a payroll item from a tax, uncheck the respective check box.</p>
