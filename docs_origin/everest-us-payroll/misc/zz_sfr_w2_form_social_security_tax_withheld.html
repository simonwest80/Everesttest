<p>This field displays the total amount of social security tax withheld,  including social security tax on tips, from the employee’s pay. Hence  this box is calculated as the sum of the total social security tax withheld  from the employee’s paycheck throughout the year.</p>

<p>The maximum value that can be displayed in this field is obtained by  applying the following formula:</p>

<p>Social security wage base limit for the year * Tax rate for the year</p>

<p class="example">The Social security wage base limit for 2009  is $106,800 and the tax rate for the year is 6.2%; hence, the maximum  value this box can display is $ 106,800 * 6.2% = $ 6,021.60.</p>
