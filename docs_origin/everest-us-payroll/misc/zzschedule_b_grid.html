<p>Day</p>

<p>This column displays the days of the month.</p>

<p>Calculated Amount</p>

<p>The tax liability for each date when wages are paid is calculated by  <strong>Everest</strong> and displayed in this  column. You cannot edit this amount.</p>

<p>Adjustments</p>

<p>Enter the amount of under-reported or over-reported tax liability as  adjustments in the <strong>Adjustments</strong>  column. You can enter both positive and negative amounts in this column;  however, the figure should not exceed the amount displayed in the <strong>Calculated Amount</strong> column. Since an over-reported  liability has to be offset only against subsequent liabilities, the credit  adjustment amount cannot be more than the ‘Calculated amount’.</p>

<p class="note">Under-reported tax liability must be adjusted  against the date on which the error is discovered.</p>

<p class="example">Tax liability for the quarter April-June 2003  was $15,000. However, the tax reported in Schedule B for that quarter  was only $ 13,000. If you notice this difference of $2000 on December  4th, 2003, report the same in the October-December quarter of 2003 against  the date December 4th.</p>

<p class="note">To rectify an over-reported liability, adjust  the amount as a credit in subsequent liabilities until the amount is exhausted.</p>

<p class="example">You pay wages on every alternate day of the  month: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and so on. On the 3rd of December, you  discover that you have over reported social security tax on a prior quarter  by $12,000. Break up the over-reported amount and adjust it against the  tax liabilities of three pay days: ($5000) on 3rd December, ($5000) on  5th December and ($2000) on 7th December.</p>

<p>Final Amount</p>

<p>The ‘Final Amount’  is calculated as a sum of the columns ‘Calculated Amount’ and ‘Adjustments’.</p>
