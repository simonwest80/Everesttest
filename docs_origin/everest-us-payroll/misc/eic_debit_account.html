  <dt><strong>EIC Debit Account and Location/Sub-Location</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Advance Earned Income Credit (EIC) is paid to  low income employees by the employer on behalf of the Federal Government.  The amounts paid towards EIC are deducted from the total amount of FITA,  social security and medicare taxes payable to the Federal Government at  the time of payment.</dd>
  <dd>Amounts paid towards EIC can be treated either as  an expense or as an asset to be adjusted towards the taxes paid to the  Federal Government. The EIC Debit account is the asset or the expense  to which advance EIC amounts have to be debited.</dd>
  <dd>“Location/Sub-Location” is the location  or sub-location responsible for the expense or asset account.</dd>
