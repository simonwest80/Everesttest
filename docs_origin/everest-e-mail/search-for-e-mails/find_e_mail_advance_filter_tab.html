<p>This tab facilitates an advanced search and you can specify multiple  search parameters. This is a more complex option than the other tabs in  the <strong>Find</strong> filters, and is extremely  useful to narrow down your search to meet your requirements.</p>

<p>When you choose parameters in any of the tabs, (such as <strong>Quick 
 Find</strong>), and click the <strong>Find</strong>  button, the find condition is automatically displayed in this tab.</p>

<p>You can specify advanced conditions to search out for mails that match  your condition.</p>

<p class="steps">To create an advanced find filter, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Advanced Find</strong> tab, select <Click here="" to="" add="" condition="">. You will see a new condition added.</Click></li>
  <li>Click the underlined  condition (e.g. Look  In), you will see a drop- down list.</li>
  <li>Select the  condition you want to apply from the drop-down list.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>&lt;?&gt;</strong> and type the condition string  to be filtered. Click <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can add multiple conditions and modify them by clicking <Click here="" to="" add="" condition="">.</Click></p>

<p>You can also select or deselect queries in the <strong>Advanced 
 Find</strong> pane by selecting or deselecting  the query check box.</p>

<p class="example">If you want to search for messages you have  received from Steve, you need to create a query <strong>From</strong>  in <strong>Steve</strong>.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Find</strong> to view the messages  that match your condition.</p>
