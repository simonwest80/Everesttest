<p>MAPI is an acronym for Messaging Application Programming Interface.  MAPI is a key industry-standard API because it lets Windows-based applications  interact with many different messaging services by using a single interface.  Messaging services have evolved to encompass much more than just electronic  mail. Today, messaging services include fax and voice support, Internet  mail, rich information sharing applications such as Microsoft Exchange  Server and network based information services such as MSN.  Through MAPI, the applications and messaging clients can take advantage  of the growing number of these messaging services.</p>

<p>The MAPI architecture defines the way in which MAPI applications and  messaging clients, such as the Microsoft Exchange client, interact with  various messaging services such as Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Exchange  Server; MSN  (The Microsoft Network), CompuServe®,  and the Internet.</p>
