<h1 id="check-names-dialog-box">Check Names Dialog Box</h1>

<p>When there are similar names in your address book, clicking on the <strong>Tools &gt; Check Names</strong> option brings  up the <strong>Check Names</strong> dialog box.  When selected, the dialog box displays the matching names in the address  book. You can select the appropriate name (or e-mail ID) to whom you want  to send mail.</p>

<p class="example">You have ‘Mary John’ and ‘John Fredericks’ in your address book. When  you type ‘John’ in the <strong>To</strong>, <strong>Cc</strong> or <strong>Bcc</strong>  fields of the message window and select the <strong>Check 
 Names</strong> option, the dialog box will display both ‘Mary John’ and  ‘John Frederick’ along with their respective e-mail ID’s.</p>

<p>If you misspell a name or type a name which is not present in your address  book, and then select the <strong>Check Names</strong>  option, <strong>Everest E-Mail</strong> does not  recognize it and the dialog box displays “No Suggestions”.</p>
