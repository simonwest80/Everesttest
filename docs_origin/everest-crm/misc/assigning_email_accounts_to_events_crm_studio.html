<p>You have to assign e-mail accounts to events if you want to send an  e-mail upon triggering of an event. For each event an e-mail account can  be assigned or the same account can be assigned for different events.  When the event occurs, the e-mail is sent from the account that you have  specified.</p>

<p class="steps">To assign e-mail accounts to events, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect</strong>. You will see the <strong>Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Under <strong>Application Events</strong> in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign the e-mail accounts.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Events</strong> option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the  event for which you wish to assign the e-mail account and double-click  to edit. You will see the <strong>Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Email</strong> tab and specify the e-mail  account. You can also include reports or files as attachments and send  them along with the e-mail.</li>
</ul>
