<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to create  your own attachment templates and send them as an HTML attachment along  with e-mails from Business Activity Monitoring to internal parties such  as users of <strong>Everest</strong> and external  parties such as customers and vendors whenever the specified event occurs.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>The attachment  templates will be only in .htm or .html format. No other file formats  are supported.</li>
  <li>You must copy your  own attachment templates into the folder where <strong>xpEverestACRM.dll</strong>  resides other than <strong>Everest</strong> folder  structure. This folder location can vary, but it is typically located  in the path: <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft 
 SQL Server\MSSQL\Binn</strong>. If the MS SQL instance is located on the  D: drive, the path could begin with a D instead of a C.</li>
  <li>If you do not copy  any attachment template files to this path, the attachments will be sent  in the system defined format.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">: You may want to create a purchase invoice template  in your own format and send as an e-mail attachment whenever a purchase  invoice is created. To execute this, you have to create a purchase invoice  template with the given list of tags provided in <strong>Everest</strong>  and copy it in the specified name and path, typically <strong>C:\Program 
 Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL\Binn</strong>. The system will use the  attachment template file associated with the document type to generate  e-mail attachment if it is saved in the specified name and path and attached  to the event.</p>
