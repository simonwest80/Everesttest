<p>Consider you have new customers who have joined your existing customer  base. You may want to greet all new customers by sending them a welcome  e-mail. To do so, you can specify the following format:</p>

<p>Dear &lt;#CUSTFIRSTNAMECONT&gt;  &lt;#CUSTLASTNAMECONT&gt;,</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>We at &lt;#LEGALCOMPNAME&gt;  welcome you to our existing customer base and look forward to a long and  fruitful association with you. Your date of joining us as a customer is  &lt;#SYSCURRDATE</td>
      <td>D4</td>
      <td>&gt;.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We also look forward to your feedback from time to time to enable us  to provide the best services for our customers.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Staff members</p>

<p>&lt;#LEGALCOMPNAME&gt;</p>

<p>In the above format, the tags will be replaced by actual data in the  output.</p>

<p class="note">The format specifier should be inserted before  the closing braces of the tag as shown in the example.</p>

<p>In <strong>Everest CRM</strong>,  there are some <a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-crm/misc/special_tags.html">Special Tags</a> that result  in additional output when the action is executed.</p>
