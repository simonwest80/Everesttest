<p>Similar to assigning e-mail accounts to events, you can assign fax accounts  to events if you want to send a fax upon triggering of an event. For each  event a fax account can be assigned or the same account can be assigned  for different events. When the event occurs, the fax is sent from the  account that you have specified.</p>

<p class="steps">To assign fax accounts to events, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect</strong>. You will see the <strong>Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Under <strong>Application Events</strong> in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign the fax accounts.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Events</strong> option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the  event for which you wish to assign the fax account and double-click to  edit. You will see the <strong>Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Fax</strong> tab and specify the fax account.  You can specify a cover page or a template to be followed while sending  fax. You can also include text reports or text files as fax pages and  send.</li>
</ul>
