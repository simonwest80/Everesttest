<p>To manage your business operations you can define processes or activities.</p>

<p>An activity is a step taken to perform a specific action. A process  or procedure can be described as a series of activities or steps a user  takes to complete a specific task. Each process should have at least one  activity. Each activity is associated with an action that gets executed  when the event occurs. Examples of actions are sending e-mail, printing  reports or letters, creating tasks/appointments etc. Each action is scheduled  to be carried out at a specific time.</p>

<p class="example">Suppose you do a sale and have to create an invoice for the same. You  want several things to be accomplished when the invoice is created, say,  sending e-mail to the customer about the status of the invoice, informing  the sales team, printing a report to be given to the manager or setting  a task for the sales representative for the follow-up with the customer.</p>

<p>In such case, to accomplish the task you can define a process with the  above activities, each activity performing an action.</p>
