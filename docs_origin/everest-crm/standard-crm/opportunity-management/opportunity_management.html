<p>Opportunity Management in <strong>Everest CRM</strong>helps you keep track of the possible sales opportunities that you  may encounter in business. Prospective customers and the value of sales  expected are tracked in <strong>Everest CRM</strong>using <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">the </font><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-crm/standard-crm/opportunity-management/the-sales-process.chm::/sales_opportunities_an_introduction.html">Sales  Opportunity</a> feature. Creating sales opportunities helps you track  the stage each opportunity is in, its probable value and expected date  of closure.</p>

<p>Sales opportunity may be tracked using the details given below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/opportunity-grades/opportunity_grade.html">Grade</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/sources-of-opportunities/source_of_opportunity.html">Source</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reasons_closed_sales_opp.html">Reason  closed</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/sales-stages/sales_stages.html">Sales  stage</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can enter sales opportunity details such as source, grade, stage  and reason closed directly in a sales quote, order and invoice without  creating a sales opportunity first.</p>

<p>Maintaining sales opportunity details for sales quotes, orders or invoices  that are created directly is important for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can track  the stage in which the sales quote is.</li>
  <li>You can measure  the effectiveness of the various means of advertisement by keeping track  of the source of the sale.</li>
  <li>You can track  the reasons for clinching the order.</li>
</ul>
