<p>CRM, an acronym  for Customer Relationship Management, is an information technology industry  term for methodologies, software, and usually Internet capabilities that  help an enterprise manage customer relationships in an organized way.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>An enterprise might build a database about  its customers so that management, sales people, customer service providers  could access information, match customer needs with product plans and  offerings, remind customers of service requirements, know what other products  a customer had purchased, and so forth.</strong></p>

<p>Simply stated, CRM  is about successfully attracting and retaining customers.</p>

<p>CRM is the  core of any customer-focused business strategy and includes the people,  processes, and technology questions associated with marketing, sales,  and service. In today’s hyper-competitive world, organizations looking  to implement successful CRM  strategies need to focus on a common view of the customer using integrated  information systems and contact center implementations that allow the  customer to communicate via any desired communication channel.</p>

<p>CRM includes  everything used to attract and retain customers, prospects, and business  partners. It includes Contact Management, Sales Force Automation, Opportunity  Management, Relationship Management, Marketing Automation, Company Websites,  Telesales and  Telemarketing Systems. Essentially, any and all technologies, processes  and procedures that facilitate or support the Sales and Marketing functions  can be identified with CRM.</p>
