<p>When you try to save a new document, profile or journal, <strong>Everest</strong>  assigns the current number in sequence (as specified in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile) and automatically generates the next sequence number.</p>

<p>If the system is unable to save the data for some reason; then the current  sequence number that has been assigned by <strong>Everest</strong>  to the new document, profile or journal is not used.</p>

<p>If the document is not saved, the sequence number assigned to it is  lost.</p>

<p>The next time the document, profile or journal is saved <strong>Everest</strong>  assigns the next sequence number.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You  create a Purchase Quote that is assigned the number 1000, but are unable  to save due to a system failure. When you re-save the Purchase Quote a  new sequence number 1001 is assigned to it.</p>
