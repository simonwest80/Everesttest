<p>Enter the path (\server name\shared folder name) where the third party  catalog images must be copied.</p>

<p>An UNC is a naming convention that permits you to use a network resource,  such as a network server, without formally connecting to the network resource  with a mapped drive.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/example.gif" alt="" /> The file  you want to copy exists on a server. Let us call it “Images”. It also  must be in a folder on that server. Let us call it “Files”. If you share  the folder you can access it remotely by connecting to \IMAGES\FILES.</p>
