<p>If you check the boxes in the <strong>Searchable</strong>  column, the respective fields will appear as sort tabs in the output browser.  This activates the fields and allows you to perform a local search on  these fields which is typically faster than a search on the server.</p>

<p class="note">For the <strong>Sort</strong>  tabs to display, enable them in the browser properties. Right-click the  title bar and select <strong>Browser Properties</strong>.  On the Browser Property Editor <strong>General</strong>  tab, in the <strong>Show Index Tabs</strong> section,  select <strong>Bottom</strong>. Click <strong>Apply</strong>  and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>You can  select  a predefined action or activity for a field in the <strong>Action</strong>  column that will occur when you select that field in the output browser.  For additional drill-down capabilities, you can also select your predefined  Advanced Query Builder filters as actions.</p>

<p class="example">If you select “Open Customer Profile” for  the ADDRESS.NAME field, you must also select an Action Parameter 1, such  as “CUST_CODE”. This is necessary since there could be multiple customer  codes with the same name.</p>

<p>The <strong>Action Parameter 1</strong> and <strong>Action Parameter 2</strong> columns activate  based upon your Action selection. If parameters are required to uniquely  identify what should happen, you must select the relevant action parameters.</p>

<dl class="example">
  <dt>If you select to open a Document Profile,  you must also identify the document type and document number. Refer to  the Advanced Query Builder Supported Actions section for more information.</dt>
