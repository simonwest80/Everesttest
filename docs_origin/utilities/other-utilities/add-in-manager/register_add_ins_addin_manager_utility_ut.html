<p>Programmers create add-in configuration files that are added to <strong>Everest</strong>. These configuration files give  <strong>Everest</strong> necessary information  about the add-in such as where the add-in attaches to <strong>Everest</strong>,  where the add-in is located, and whether or not the add-in is enabled  by default. When you start <strong>Everest</strong>,  these add-in configuration files are validated by the system. <strong>Everest</strong>  then registers the add-in on the workstation. Add-ins must be installed  and registered on each workstation where they will be used.</p>
