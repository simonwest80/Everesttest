<p>You can completely remove an add-in from a workstation, if necessary.  This removes the add-in from the Add-In Manager list and it cannot be  enabled. If you need to use this add-in again in the future, it must be  reinstalled.</p>

<p class="steps">To remove an add-in from the Add-In Manager  list, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main menu  bar of the appropriate workstation, select <strong>Utility</strong>  &gt; <strong>Add-In</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Add-In 
 Manager</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the add-in  to be removed from the list.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Remove</strong> button. The selected add-in is  removed from the list and the add-in configuration file extension is renamed  from ACF to BAK.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button to exit the <strong>Add-In 
 Manager</strong> utility.</li>
</ul>
