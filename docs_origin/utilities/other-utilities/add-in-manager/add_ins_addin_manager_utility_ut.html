<p>An <strong>Add-In</strong> is a supplemental  program that extends the functionality of the main <strong>Everest</strong>  application. Usually they are created by third-party programmers to better  satisfy the requirements of your business environment. <strong>Everest</strong>  browsers, documents and profiles can use add-ins.</p>

<p class="example">A Chart add-in is added to the <strong>Items</strong>  browser which displays the top ten items when selected from the menu bar.  The following figure displays the location of the add-in on the toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Figure:  Items Browser with Chart FX Add-In</strong></p>

<p>In this example, when the user opens the <strong>Items</strong>  browser and clicks the <strong>Chart FX Add-In</strong>  icon on the toolbar, the add-in executes and a chart displays the top  ten items.</p>
