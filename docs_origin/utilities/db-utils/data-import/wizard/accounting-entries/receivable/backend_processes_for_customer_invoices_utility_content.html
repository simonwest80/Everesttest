<p>Credit Memo</p>

<p>A manual credit memo is automatically generated when you import a credit  memo.</p>

<p>When you import Accounts Receivable balances and credit memos, entries  are made in an open sales journal that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The login date  falls in the same accounting period as the open sales journal.</li>
  <li>The open sales  journal belongs to the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> of the user (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Workstation Settings</strong>).</li>
  <li>The open sales  journal belongs to the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user importing the balances.</li>
  <li>A system journal  with the description ‘A/R Import’  exists.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If such an open journal does not exist, a  new sales journal is created using the sequence number from the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoicing</strong>  tab).</p>
