<p>Purchase Invoice</p>

<p>A manual purchase invoice is automatically generated when a purchase  invoice is imported.</p>

<p>Debit Memo</p>

<p>A manual debit memo is automatically generated when a debit memo is  imported.</p>

<p>When you import purchase invoices and debit memos, entries are made  in an open purchase journal that fulfils the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The login date  falls in the same accounting period as the open purchase journal.</li>
  <li>The open purchase  journal belongs to the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> of the user (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Workstation Settings</strong>).</li>
  <li>The open purchase  journal with the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user importing the balances.</li>
  <li>A system journal  with the description ‘A/P Import’  exists.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If such an open journal does not exist, a  new purchase journal is created using the sequence number from the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong>&gt;  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchasing</strong> tab).</p>
