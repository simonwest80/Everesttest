<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you  to import all your matrix items and create a matrix group with the <strong>Everest</strong> <strong>Matrix 
 Item Import Wizard</strong>. This feature is especially useful to import  a large number of matrix items at a time by importing an Excel (.xls/.csv)  file that lists all the matrix items.</p>

<p>Import matrix items when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You are implementing  <strong>Everest</strong> and have a large number  of items that must be configured as Matrix Groups in <strong>Everest</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">You are an apparel company selling over 1000  styles of clothing.  Each  style must be configured as a matrix group and includes over 7 different  variations such as Size and Color.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your vendor has  provided you with a file that has item code, description and price details  for a new line of products that you plan to carry.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">You are preparing for the fall fashion season  by configuring 15 new styles of coats you are going to sell.</p>
