<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows multiple layers  of location classification. You can categorize your company based on functions,  products, locations, profit centers, cost centers or any other criteria  and a combination of these criteria.</p>

<p>A location is at the parent level in the tree hierarchy and a sub-location  forms a child to it, i.e., a sub-locations always falls under a location  in the hierarchy.</p>

<p class="example">You may create the following location/sub-location structure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your places  of business in Virginia and North Carolina can be set up as locations.</li>
  <li>You can then  set up your sales and administration functions as sub-locations for both  Virginia and North Carolina.</li>
  <li>Further, you  can set up sub-locations for the sale of computer hardware and software,  under the sales sub-location in each case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/department_structure.html">here</a> for a diagrammatic  representation of this location/sub-location structure.</p>

<p>The <strong>Company Information - Locations/Sub-Locations</strong> section of the wizard is used to create locations as well as sub-locations.</p>
