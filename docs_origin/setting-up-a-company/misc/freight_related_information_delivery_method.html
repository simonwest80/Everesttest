<p>When you ship items to customers, freight charges can include residential  charges, collect on delivery fees and insurance charges for a particular  delivery method.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Insurance Charges Type/Per</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use these options to specify the amount of insurance  to be included as a part of freight charges, while delivering items to  a customer. You can charge insurance in one of the two ways:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>As a percentage  of the value of the items being sold.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">You can charge insurance as 10% of the total value of the items that  are sold.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a flat rate  for goods worth a certain amount.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">For every 100 dollars worth of items, you can charge $5 as insurance  charges.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Residential Address Charge</strong></dt>

</ul>

<p class="example">You can charge a residential address fee of $5 on a shipment that contains  items of $100 value.</p>

</ul>

<p class="example">You can charge a residential fee of $2 for each of the five individual  items being shipped.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>COD Fee</strong></dt>

</dl>
