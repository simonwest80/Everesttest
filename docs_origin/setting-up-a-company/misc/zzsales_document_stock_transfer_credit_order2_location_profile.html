<p>Specify the stock area to which items detached from a credit order have  to be moved.</p>

<p class="example">When items are sent by customers for repairs or exchange, you can record  them  in  a credit order. When these items are returned to the customer, you can  un-assign them from the credit order and move them to a stock area called  ‘Serviced Items’.</p>
