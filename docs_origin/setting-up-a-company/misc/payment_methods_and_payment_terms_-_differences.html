<p>Payment methods define how the payment must be made, while payment terms  define when the payment must be made.</p>

<p>Use payment terms to compute the due date for payment. Discounts applicable  for early payments are also specified in the <strong>Payment</strong><strong>Terms</strong> profile.</p>

<p>Payment methods can be assigned to payment terms so that for a particular  payment term, payments can be made or received only through the specified  payment methods.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>Make sure that you distinguish between payment  terms and payment methods. For instance, cash and check are payment methods,  whereas Net 30 days and Cash on delivery are payment terms.</strong></p>
