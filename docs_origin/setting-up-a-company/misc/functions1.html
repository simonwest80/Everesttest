<p>Functions are the key areas in <strong>Everest</strong>  such as Accounting, Inventory and Invoicing. To sort the security rights  based on functions, click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/img/sort_by_function.gif" alt="" /> icon<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">
 </font>on the toolbar.</p>

<p>It is useful to sort the security rights based on a particular function,  to assign rights pertaining to a particular function to several users.  The time and effort for assigning rights is thereby considerably reduced.</p>

<p class="example">To assign rights to new users in the sales  department, sort the security rights based on the Invoicing function and  grant the required rights.</p>
