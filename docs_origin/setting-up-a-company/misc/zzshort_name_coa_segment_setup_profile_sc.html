<p>Use the <strong>Short Name</strong> field to  define a unique Short Name for the segment. A <strong>Short 
 Name</strong> is an alphanumeric code that identifies a segment and is limited  by the length assigned to the segment.</p>

<p class="example">If a segment is defined with a length of four  characters, the segment <strong>Short Name</strong>  can be 1-4 characters.</p>

<p class="hint">To make your segment template more meaningful,  create Short Names with the same number of characters  as the segment length.</p>

<p>The <strong>Short Name</strong> can be edited  at any time but the number of characters in the Short Name cannot be changed.</p>

<p class="example">A <strong>Short Name</strong>  can be changed from DIV to BRC. It cannot be changed from DIV to BRANCH.</p>
