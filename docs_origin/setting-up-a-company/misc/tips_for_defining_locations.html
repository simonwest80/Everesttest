<p>Keep the following points in mind while creating locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your company  has multiple offices situated in different territories, and you require  different sequence numbers, billing address and logos for sales documents  for each area, then create a location for each territory.</li>
  <li>If separate  sequence numbers are required for each sales channel (such as mail order,  web and retail), you must set up each sales channel as a location.</li>
  <li>You must define  a separate location for each office in which <strong>Everest</strong>  is remotely installed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example"><strong>A copy of the **Everest</strong>  database is installed in your sales office located in California. Since  you need to carry out the synchronization process at regular intervals,  set up California as a location.**</p>
