<p>Sales or purchase documents can be created for any location/sub-location.  If the document is created for a sub-location, the address, logo and sequence  numbers of the respective location are used.</p>

<p>Locations/Sub-Locations can be specified for each line item in a document.  This enables the measurement of the revenues and expenses for each line  item.</p>
