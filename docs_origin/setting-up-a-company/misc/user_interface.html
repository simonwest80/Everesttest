<p>To sort the security rights based on user interfaces such as browsers  and profiles, click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/img/setup_sort_by_user_interface.gif" alt="" /> icon on the toolbar.</p>

<p>It is useful to sort the security rights based on user interfaces to  assign rights pertaining to a particular function to the user, but restrict  access to certain user interfaces within that function.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>To restrict a user from modifying invoicing  profiles, sort the security rights based on user interfaces, and select  **Profiles&gt; Invoicing</strong>. Move all  the rights pertaining to invoicing to the <strong>Rights 
 not assigned</strong> column.**</p>
