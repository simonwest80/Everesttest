<p>Specify the location of your workstation reports repository. <strong>Everest 
 Reports</strong> reside in, and are accessed from this location.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>• Locations that you enter in this field override  the global reports repository path in the Reporting Preferences (Path:  **File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong>  &gt; <strong>Reporting Preferences</strong> &gt;  <strong>Export Settings</strong> tab).**</p>

<p><strong>• All repository paths in Everest are stored  in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths. On a network, the UNC is a  method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer, without  having to specify the storage device it is on. For Windows, the UNC name  format is \servername\sharename\path\filename.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• You can specify the reports repository of  the local workstation, or another server/workstation on your network,  as your workstation reports repository.</strong></p>
