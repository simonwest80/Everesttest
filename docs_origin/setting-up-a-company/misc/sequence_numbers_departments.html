<h1 id="sequence-numbers">Sequence Numbers</h1>

<p>Sequence numbers are the numbers assigned by <strong>Everest</strong>  to all the documents (purchasing, sales and returns), vendors, customers  and serialized inventory items. The first sequence number for each of  the documents is set in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; Location &gt; In 
 New Window</strong>). <strong>Everest</strong> assigns  the number automatically.</p>

<p>You can specify a different range of sequence numbers for each location.  Sequence numbers can be specified for items, customers, vendors, each  type of sales and purchase document and each type of journal.</p>

<p>When a new customer or vendor is created and the customer/vendor code  is left blank, the sequence number for customers/vendors specified for  the login location or the location of the login sub-location is assigned.  If sequence numbers are not mentioned for the login location or the location  of the login sub-location, the sequence numbers for the default location  are used.</p>

<p>When a sales or purchase document is created, the sequence number of  the location for that document type is used.</p>

<p>When a journal is created,  the  sequence number for the login location/sub-location for that journal type  is used.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Serial numbers are assigned continuously.  Documents using alias are not assigned a different sequence. To start  a new sequence, you can change the sequence numbers manually in the **Location</strong> profile. Sequence numbers of  purged documents are not available for use when creating documents.**</p>
