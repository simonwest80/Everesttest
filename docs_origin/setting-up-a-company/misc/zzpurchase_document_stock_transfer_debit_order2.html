<p>Specify the stock area to which  items attached to a debit order must be transferred when the items are  detached.</p>

<p class="example">When items are sent to vendors for repairs or exchange, they are recorded  in a debit order. When the items are returned after repair or exchange,  you can detach them from the debit order. Such items may be moved to a  stock area called ‘Repaired Items’.</p>
