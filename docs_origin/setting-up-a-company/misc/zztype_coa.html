<p>Select whether the account is a <strong>general</strong>  or <strong>detail</strong> account. This is a mandatory  field.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of accounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>General</li>
  <li>Detail</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>General</strong> accounts are a summary  of the detail accounts below them and can have one or more general and/or  detail subaccounts.  They are used for heading and grouping purposes. The account balance of  the general account is made up of the total of the subaccount  balances.</p>

<p>Level 1 accounts are always general accounts, and only a level one account  can be defined per financial statement section (i.e., Asset, Liability,  Capital, Income and Expenses).</p>

<p><strong>Detail</strong> accounts contain the  transaction details and do not have subaccounts  below them. They are also referred to as the child of the parent (general)  account. They are used for balances and posting.</p>

<p>When you post the transactions, the general accounts are updated with  the balances of the detail accounts, and the general accounts at the top-most  level (if any) are in turn updated by the balances of the general accounts  under them.</p>

<p>System generated journals can be viewed and then posted to update the  General Ledger.</p>
