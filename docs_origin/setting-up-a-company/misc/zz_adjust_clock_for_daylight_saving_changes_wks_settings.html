<p>Select this option if you want your <strong>Everest</strong>  clock settings to be adjusted to reflect daylight saving time. You must  select this option during daylight savings time and clear this option  when it is not daylight savings time. For most of the United States, this  entails moving the clock forward by one hour on the second Sunday in March  and moving it back by an hour on the first Sunday of November. This change  affects your Contact Manager. It does not affect your Time Clock schedules  since the <strong>Everest</strong> Time Clock module  uses the time from the client workstation’s operating system settings  and not the <strong>Everest</strong> settings.</p>
