<p><strong>Accounting Periods</strong> are the time  periods into which a fiscal year is divided. The number of periods depend  on operational requirements such as average transactions in a period,  the period for which budgets are set and variances analyzed. The number  of periods in a fiscal year is normally 12.</p>
