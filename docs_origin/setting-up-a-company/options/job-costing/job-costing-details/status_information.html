<p>Use the <strong>Status</strong> option to specify  the status of a job. The options are <strong>Open</strong>  and <strong>Close</strong>. When a job is created,  the status by default is “Open”. Once a job is completed and  you receive all the payments and receipts pertaining to the job, you can  mark the job as “Close”. A closed job is no longer available  on documents and journals.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>A job must be marked as “Close”  after receiving all payments and receipts. Otherwise, you cannot account  for expenses even if the job is completed.</strong></p>
