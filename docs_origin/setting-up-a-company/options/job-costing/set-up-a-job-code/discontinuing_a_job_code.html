<p>When you discontinue a job code, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is deactivated. A discontinued job code can be made available  for selection by activating it. Further expenses or revenue cannot be  allocated to the discontinued job code.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a job code, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Miscellaneous &gt; Job Explorer</strong>. You will see the <strong>Job 
 Explorer</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Job Explorer</strong>, highlight the record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong><font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is not </font>visible in the <strong>Job 
 Explorer</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You cannot discontinue a job code that is  associated with a promotion. However, it is possible to do so if the promotion  has expired.</p>
