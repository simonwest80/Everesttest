<p>The <strong>Job Explorer</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Job Explorer</strong>) displays details of existing  jobs. To limit the amount of data displayed, you can select the date range  of the jobs to view. By default, the Job Explorer shows job type details  created from the beginning of the current month to the current date. You  can change the date range of the jobs to view and save your selection  so that your browser always opens to your selected date range. An option  is also available to filter the type of documents viewed, such as only  final, sales, or purchase documents. The Job Explorer contains three sections:  the <strong>Date Filter</strong> header and the  <strong>Left</strong> and <strong>Right</strong>  panels.</p>
