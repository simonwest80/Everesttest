<p>The net income of a company is the excess of its revenue over expense  in a particular period. A company’s revenue and expense in any period  comprises several business transactions. Besides assessing overall profit,  income and expenses, businesses also measure the income and expenses associated  with specific projects or jobs. Job costing <em>**</em> is an accounting tool used for tracking revenue and expenses associated  with specific jobs or projects.</p>

<p>Job costing is used to find out whether a specific project or job is  profitable. In <strong>Everest</strong>, job codes  are attached to items on a line item basis in sales, credit, purchase  and debit documents. The revenues and expense pertaining to the job are  tracked and recorded in the job costing reports. The sales and purchase  documents associated with the job can be viewed from the <strong>Job 
 Explorer</strong>.</p>

<p>You can define a job that may be undertaken for a particular customer  or a common service rendered to all customers. Job codes can be attached  to all the journals.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives of job costing</strong></p>

<p>Job costing has the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measuring the  revenue and costs associated with a specific job or project.</li>
  <li>Assessing the  profitability of a job or project executed for customers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example"><strong>If more than one service contract is executed  for a customer, job costing helps you measure the revenue and costs for  each job.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Assessing the  total expense on jobs or projects executed for in-house contracts or capital  projects.</li>
  <li>Measuring the  variance between the estimated revenue and costs as against the actual.</li>
</ul>
