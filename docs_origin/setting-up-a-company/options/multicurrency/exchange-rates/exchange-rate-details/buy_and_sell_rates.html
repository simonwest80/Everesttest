<h1 id="buy-and-sell-rates">Buy and Sell Rates</h1>

<p>The definition of the buy and sell rates depends on the perspective  with which it is defined. From the viewpoint of the bank, the <strong>Buy 
 Rate</strong> is the rate at which deposits in the currency are credited  into your bank account. The <strong>Sell Rate</strong> is the rate at which withdrawals in the currency are debited to  your bank account. The <strong>Buy Rate</strong> for  the bank would be your <strong>Sell Rate</strong>  and vice versa. You can enter up to six decimals.</p>

<p>How you define the buy and sell rates is important as different transactions  may require different rates.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If you are creating a transaction for receiving  foreign currency payments from your customer, you need to use the rate  at which your bank will credit your account for the deposit. But, if you  are issuing a foreign currency check to a vendor, you will use the rate  at which your bank debits your account for the withdrawal.</strong></p>
