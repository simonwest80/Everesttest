<p>Liabilities&lt;/font&gt;</p>

<p>Re-measurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities is required  at the end of the fiscal year when accounts are being closed, so that  they are stated at their actual values in your final accounts.</p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp1 example">Your base currency is USD and you owe GBP 5000 to 
 a vendor, which you account at 1 GBP = 0.44 USD. </font>

<p>If on your balance sheet date, the rate is 1 GBP = 1.50 USD, you owe  the vendor USD 500 less. Hence, the vendor account has to be re-measured  to account for the currency fluctuation on the balance sheet date.</p>

<p>Some accounting standards such as the FASB  52 make remeasurement mandatory.</p>

<p>Use the multicurrency remeasurement utility to calculate foreign currency  customer, vendor and ledger accounts at the exchange rate on date of re-measurement,  and automatically accounts for the net foreign exchange gain or loss on  remeasurement.</p>
