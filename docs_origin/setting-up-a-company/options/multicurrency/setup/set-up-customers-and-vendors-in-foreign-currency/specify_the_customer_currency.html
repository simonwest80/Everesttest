<p>If you have foreign currency dealings with customers, you have to specify  the currency in which you want to deal with them. This is specified in  the <strong>Customer</strong> profile (path: <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customers &gt;</strong> <strong>Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Accounting</strong> tab).</p>

<p>Thereafter, all transactions with the customer will be in the foreign  currency specified. You will not be allowed to transact with them in any  other currency.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>You can set up the currency for a customer  only at the time of creation of the account. Once the **Customer</strong>  profile has been saved, you can no longer change the <strong>Currency 
 Code</strong>.**</p>
