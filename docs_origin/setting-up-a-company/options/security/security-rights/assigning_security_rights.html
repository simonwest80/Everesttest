<p>You can assign security rights either to a user or to a user group.  Users are given rights to functions based on either the individual security  rights assigned or the security rights assigned to the user group. Ideally,  users are assigned to groups, and rights are assigned to groups. This  makes management easier, especially when a user is created. The simple  process of assigning a user to a group automatically assigns all the rights  of the group to the user.</p>
