<p><strong>Everest</strong> uses a multi-level encrypted  password system for all critical areas and tasks to provide complete data  protection.</p>

<p>Encrypting is a security method used to encode the password by applying  an algorithm to plain text to change it to ciphertext.</p>

<p>Passwords can be changed by the user or by the system supervisor (or  anyone with equivalent rights) as needed.</p>
