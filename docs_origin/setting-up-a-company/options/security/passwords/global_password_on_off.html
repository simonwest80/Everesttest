<p>Because of <strong>Everest</strong><font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana">’</font>s elaborate security layer, users are required  to enter their user ID and password for each function.</p>

<p>Entering the password repeatedly can be tedious, but is a valuable safeguard  for data when multiple users use the same computer or when the system  is not in a secure location. However, in some cases, the extra effort  of repeatedly entering the user ID and password can be a detriment to  the user efficiency. For this reason, <strong>Everest</strong>  has the <strong>Global Password</strong> option.</p>

<p>When this option is toggled <strong>ON</strong>,  the user can perform all the functions for which access has been granted,  without having to enter the password again.</p>

<p>If the user attempts to perform a function for which no access rights  have been given, the user is prompted for a user name and password with  adequate rights. Only a user with the requisite rights can enter this  domain. This feature helps a manager to allow temporary access to a particular  function.</p>

<p>When <strong>Everest</strong> is first installed,  the Global Password option is <strong>ON</strong>.</p>
