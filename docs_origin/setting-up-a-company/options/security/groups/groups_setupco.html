<p>Users can be formed into groups for easy administration. Users can belong  to one or more groups.</p>

<p class="hint">You can grant access rights to a group of  users rather than to each individual user. This makes granting and revoking  rights very easy. You can also add new users to a group rather than assigning  rights individually.</p>

<p>User groups are also helpful when sending mail to multiple users.</p>

<p class="example">You can group users by departments (Accounting,  Marketing, Purchasing, etc.) or employee classifications (Managers, Salaried,  Hourly, etc.).</p>

<p>When you create a company, <strong>Everest</strong>  automatically creates the following default user groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone</li>
  <li>Supervisors</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">During the initial setup of <strong>Everest</strong>,  the Supervisor group is created by default. You can add users requiring  administrative rights to this group. This will give users rights to all  functions. It is recommended that you configure security rights for each  group, and assign each user to the respective group after becoming familiar  with the system.</p>

<p class="note">This is a system  group and cannot be discontinued.</p>
