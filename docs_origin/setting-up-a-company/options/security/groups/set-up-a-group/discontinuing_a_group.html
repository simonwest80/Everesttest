<p>When you discontinue a group, the record is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued group can be made 
 available for selection by activating the group.</font></p>

<p>Discontinuing a group does not deactivate the users who have been assigned  to the group. The users merely lose the rights that were assigned to the  group. Further, you cannot discontinue a group to which users belong.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a group, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Users &gt; Groups</strong>. You will see the <strong>Groups</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Groups</strong> browser, highlight the group.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp1">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the <strong>Groups</strong>  browser.</li>
</ul>
