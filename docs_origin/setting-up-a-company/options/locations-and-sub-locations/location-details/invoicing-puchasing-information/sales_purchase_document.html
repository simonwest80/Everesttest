<p>Use the fields in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile - <strong>Invoicing</strong> and <strong>Purchasing</strong> tabs to specify the next  sequence numbers for the documents. Document numbers can also start in  the middle of a series. You can use this feature to continue a series  from your old accounting system. You can modify sequence numbers whenever  necessary.</p>

<p>We recommend that you start the sequence numbers for each  location with a different number, such as 10000 for the first location  and 20000 for the next location.</p>

<p>If your sequence numbers overlap in different locations,  a confirmation message displays when saving sales documents.</p>

<p><strong>Figure: Sequence Number Confirmation Message</strong></p>

<p>If you select <strong>Yes</strong>,  the system uses the next available sequence number. If you select <strong>No</strong>, you will have the opportunity to  adjust your sequence number ranges in the Location profiles before continuing.</p>

<p class="example">Suppose the last sales order created in the  MAIN location is numbered 200451 and the next sequence number in the CA  Location profile is 200452. Create a sales order in the MAIN location  and then create a sales order in the CA location. You will receive this  confirmation message when you create the sales order in the CA location.</p>

<p>Sub-Locations cannot have sequence numbers different from  those of the location.</p>

<p class="hint">The sequence number of one location should  not overlap with that of another, if each document has to have a unique  number.</p>

<p>The sequence numbers specified for the location of the login  location/sub-location are used. If no sequence numbers are not specified  in the <strong>Location</strong> profile, the sequence  numbers specified in the default location are used.</p>
