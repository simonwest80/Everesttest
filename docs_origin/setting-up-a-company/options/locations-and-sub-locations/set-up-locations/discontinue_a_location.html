<p>When you discontinue a location/sub-location, it is not deleted from  the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued location/sub-location  can be made available for selection by activating it.</p>

<p>In case a location/sub-location has sub-locations under it, all the  lower level sub-locations are also discontinued when the location/sub-location  to which they are associated is discontinued. Discontinuing a location/sub-location  does not affect documents or journals already created for that location/sub-location.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>The default location cannot be discontinued.  The location/sub-location selected during login  or specified in the **Workstation Settings</strong> of any user who has logged in cannot be discontinued.**</p>
