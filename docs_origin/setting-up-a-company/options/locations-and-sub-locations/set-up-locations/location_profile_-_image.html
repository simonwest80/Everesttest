<p>Use the <strong>Image</strong> tab to specify  the logo for each location.</p>

<p class="steps">To specify a logo for a location, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the lookup  button. You will see the <strong>Open</strong>  dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the  appropriate logo.</li>
</ul>

<p>The selected logo will be displayed in the image window. After specifying  the details, save the profile.</p>

<p>Each location can have its own logo. This logo is displayed on all purchase  and sales documents created for the location. The recommended size for  the bitmap is 5.0 x 1.4 inches or 254 x 124 pixels. Only file formats  of the type .BMP are supported. The recommended file size of the logo  is less than 1 MB.  However  sub-locations cannot have separate logos.</p>

<p class="note">If  the file size exceeds 1 MB, the performance of report printing job may  be affected because the logo must be copied to the local workstation for  each print job.</p>

<p class="example">A different logo can be specified for the  retail store and distribution outlets that are set up as locations. Thus,  sales invoices printed for the retail store will bear a different logo  from those printed for the distribution store.</p>
