<p>The concept of Value Added Taxes (VAT) states that taxes must be payable  only on value addition to an item. Value Added Tax is an indirect tax  on consumer expenditure. Unlike a retail sales tax, VAT is charged and  collected at each stage of the production process; not just on the final  sale. VAT is normally borne by the consumer in the price paid for goods  and services. It is also charged on business transactions.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>An item has a base cost of $100. It is sold  to buyer A, who pays a sales tax of 10%, i.e., $10 on it. The total cost  to him is $110. Buyer A who trades in this item, adds a profit margin  of 10% to his cost. The selling price of the item is now $121. Since sales  tax is payable @10%, the cost to the final buyer is $133.10. The tax paid  by the final buyer includes 10% on the tax component cost to A. This is  called a ‘Tax Cascade’.</strong></p>

<p>In manufacturing and other industries, there is a long chain of suppliers.  Hence, tax cascading results in a burden to the ultimate consumer. It  is for this reason that most governments have rules for Value Added Taxes.</p>

<p>If value added tax laws are in force, the amount of tax remitted by  A to the government is the net of the tax he has paid on the purchase  of the item. The procedure for the example stated above would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When the item  is purchased, buyer A will debit $100 to Inventory Control and $10 to  VAT Recoverable Account (an asset account).
    <ul>
      <li>He will fix  the selling price by adding a margin of 10% ($10) to his cost of $100.  The selling price is now $110.</li>
      <li>When the item  is sold, the cost of the goods sold gets debited by $100. Sales tax will  be calculated @10% on $110 which amounts to $11. Cost to the buyer is  $121.</li>
      <li>Sales tax payable  to the government by the buyer A is $11 - $10 i.e., tax paid on purchase,  which amounts to $1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
