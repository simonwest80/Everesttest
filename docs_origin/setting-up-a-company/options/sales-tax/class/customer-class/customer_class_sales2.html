<p>Use this (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Class &gt; Customer Class</strong>) <strong>** to open the **Customer</strong> profile  and then (path: <strong>Customer Class</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>)  to create a customer class. You can set up a special tax rule for this  class.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If you have customers who are exempted from  sales tax due to the type of business they deal in, you can create a class  of customers called “Exempt”. You can then create a special  tax rule for this class where the tax is zero. Thus, whenever you select  a customer from this class, the tax code relating to that class will automatically  be selected.</strong></p>
