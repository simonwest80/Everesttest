<h1 id="fips--codes"> FIPS  Codes</h1>

<p>The FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) code is a 10-digit  numeric code comprising the 2-digit state code, 3-digit county code and  3-digit city/town code. This combination of state, county and city is  unique and cannot be duplicated across the United States. FIPS codes are  applicable only in the United States.</p>

<p>They are used for greater accuracy, corroborating the Zip Codes, in  identifying the Tax Jurisdiction for a city/state/county in the United  States.</p>

<p>You do not need to have knowledge of the FIPS codes. Given a city/town  and zip code combination, <strong>Everest</strong>  determines the appropriate FIPS Code for the customer or jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="note">These fields are enabled only for an <strong>In</strong> type of jurisdiction.</p>
