<p><strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2">Tax components are 
 individual taxes that make up a tax code. You first create a tax component 
 and then associate the component to a tax code. </font></strong></p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp2 example">In one county, a sales tax code has a tax rate of 
 5%, consisting of two tax components - state tax of 4% and county tax 
 of 1%.</font>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">Another county, in the same state may additionally 
 require a local tax of 1%. The overall sales tax code in this county will 
 be a total of 6%, comprising state tax (4%), county tax (1%) and local 
 tax (1%).</font>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">You will therefore need to set up three tax components: 
 state tax (4%), county tax (1%) and local tax (1%), and associate the 
 first two to one tax code and all the three to another tax code.</font>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2">When you collect 
 taxes from your customers, the appropriate liability accounts are automatically 
 credited.</font></strong></p>

<p class="note">Create a Sales Tax Payable Account in your  chart of accounts for each state in which you have an office. DO NOT create  accounts for states in which you do not have an office.</p>
