<p class="steps">To create a special tax rule, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules</strong>. You will see the  <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> browser, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong>  icon. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/sales-tax/special-tax-rules/setting-up-special-tax-rules/the_special_tax_rules_profile.html"><strong>Special Tax Rule</strong> profile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can also create a Special Tax Rule from  an existing <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong>  profile by clicking <strong>Options &gt; New</strong>.</p>

<p class="warn"><strong>Everest</strong> prompts and does not  allow you to create duplicate special tax rules for the same combination  of item/category and/or customer/class of customers for the same tax jurisdiction  or location. Further, you are prompted if you try to create identical  document override rules if another rule exists for the same tax jurisdiction.  This is valid against both active and inactive rules. If a combination  is duplicated but the location or jurisdiction is different, <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to save the <strong>Special Tax Rule</strong>  profile.</p>
