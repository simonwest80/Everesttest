<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to temporarily  discontinue a Posting Group. When a Posting Group is discontinued, it  is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated. This browser  displays all the discontinued Posting Groups. A discontinued Posting Group  can be made available for selection by activating it again from this browser.  You can reactivate a Posting Group either by selecting <strong>Activate</strong>  from the <strong>Options</strong> menu or pressing  <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

<p>A Posting Group that is assigned to a master cannot be discontinued.  You must first disassociate the Posting Group from the master and then  proceed to discontinue it. The <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/assigned_masters_browser_posting_group_brow_setup_comp.html">List  Assigned Masters</a> browser (path: <strong>Posting 
 Groups</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>List Assigned Masters</strong>) displays  all the masters to which a Posting Group is assigned.</p>
