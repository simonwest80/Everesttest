<p>Debit and credit entries are automatically generated when system processes  that affect accounting, such as creating a sales invoice or payment collection  are carried out. Each of these entries is identified using an identifier  called a <strong>Source Type</strong>. Source types  also have to be identified while creating manual entries.</p>

<p>Identifying the source of entries becomes useful for audit purposes.  Source types also help identify the origin of an entry when reviewing  reports such as the Activity report.</p>

<p>User defined source types can also be created as needed for use in manual  entries.</p>

<p>System source types identify all system-generated entries. System source  types can be categorized as the following:</p>
