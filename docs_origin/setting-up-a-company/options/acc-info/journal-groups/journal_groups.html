<p>A journal group identifies the functional or operational group to which  it belongs. Transactions identified with a journal group are recorded  in the appropriate journal.</p>

<p class="example">A Journal Group POS is created to identify  sales done by the Retail Sales department in your company. If you specify  this journal group in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong>, all new Sales Journals created to record POS sales automatically  display the Journal Group. For easy identification, you can also group  the sales journals by the column header Group in the <strong>Unposted 
 Sales Journals</strong> browser.</p>

<p>Journal groups enable you to identify the origin of transactions without  having to go through the entire journal. This helps in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users for each  group can scrutinize transactions that belong to them, without having  to scan all journals.</li>
  <li>Users can print  only those journals that they require for backup and record purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also set a default journal group, to which accounting entries  from a particular workstation will belong.</p>

<p class="example">If you have three cash registers and want  to keep track of collections from each register,you can set up each one  with a different journal group. Collections from each cash register will  accumulate on the basis of the journal groups.</p>

<p>When a journal group is specified for a workstation, accounting entries  made from that workstation are appended to the first open journal for  that period that bears the specified journal group.</p>

<p>Default settings can be made from the option - <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong>.</p>
