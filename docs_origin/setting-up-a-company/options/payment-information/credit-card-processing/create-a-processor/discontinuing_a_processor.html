<p>You may want to discontinue a processor, if you no longer use the credit  card payment service for which the processor was set up. If you discontinue  a processor, you must modify the credit card payment methods to which  the processor is assigned and replace it with the processor you want to  use.</p>

<p>When you discontinue a processor, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made  available for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a processor, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Processors</strong>. You will see the <strong>Processors</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Processors</strong> browser, highlight the record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong><font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the <strong>Processors</strong>  browser.</li>
</ul>
