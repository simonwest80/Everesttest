<p>Set up a processor for each merchant account that you will  use to process credit cards.</p>

<p class="example">A business has two merchant accounts with  their merchant bank, one for retail and one for online sales. They set  up a processor in Everest for both merchant accounts.</p>

<p>If you are using multiple processors for ICVerify,  assign a sequence number for each processor.</p>

<p class="steps">To set up a processor, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Processors</strong>. You will see the <strong>Processors</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Processors</strong> browser select <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>New &gt; In New Window</strong>. You  will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/payment-information/credit-card-processing/create-a-processor/the_processors_profile.html"><strong>Processors</strong> profile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can also create a processor in any of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From an existing  <strong>Processors</strong> profile by clicking  <strong>Options &gt; New</strong>.</li>
  <li>From any profile/dialog  box that contains the <strong>Processor</strong>  field by selecting <strong>New</strong> from the  right-click menu options.</li>
</ul>
