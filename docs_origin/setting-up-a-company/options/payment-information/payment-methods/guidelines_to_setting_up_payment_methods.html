<p>The following are a few thumb rules to set up payment methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up a payment  method for each type of payment like cash, check and wire transfers.
    <ul>
      <li>Set up a payment  method for each clearing account of the same payment type. You would reconcile  these accounts with your bank statement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="example">If you deposit check payments into two different  bank accounts, you have to set up a payment method for each account. You  also need to set up payment methods for customers and vendors separately.</p>

<ol>

  <li>To use ICVerify  payment software for credit card processing, you must set up a payment  method for each card type that you accept such as Visa, MasterCard and  also Discover. To use a sequence number for each cash counter, you must  set up a payment method for each cash counter and for each card type.</li>
</ol>
