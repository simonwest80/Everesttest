<p>Stock areas can be defined in multiple levels without any restriction  on the number of levels. This allows you to define locations, warehouses  and bins as stock areas. You can also segregate stocks as sale, vendor  returns, customer returns, or stocks in transit within these locations  based on the nature of stocks. A stock area is a general stock level whereas  a bin is a detailed stock level. You can have any number of stock areas  and bins under a parent stock area. How you define the levels depends  on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How precisely  you want to pinpoint the location of the stocks.</li>
  <li>The nature  of the stocks.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can assign stock only to bins and not to general level stock areas.</p>

<p>You can define a location as the stock area at the highest level, and  bins at the lowest level.</p>
