<p>Reports in <strong>Everest</strong> are built  using “Business Objects Crystal Reports”. The <strong>Reports 
 Manager</strong> allows you to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create the  user interface for new reports. A report contains details of various activities/events  occurred in <strong>Everest</strong> for a given  period of time. However, the report files must be created using Business Objects  Crystal Reports.</li>
</ul>

  <dt><img src="/versata-everest-docs/reports-manager/img/refer.gif" alt="" /> Business Objects  Crystal Report manuals</dt>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/reports-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Generate  a report for the list of tasks that were created during a specified period  (path: <strong>Reports</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  &gt; <strong>Task</strong> <strong>List</strong>).  Specify the dates to be included in the report in the <strong>Create 
 Date From</strong> and <strong>Create Date To</strong>  fields.</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Customize the  standard reports built into <strong>Everest</strong>.</li>
  <li>Create batches  of reports and schedule the generation of these reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>Types of Reports</p>

<p><strong>Files in Reports Manager are of two 
 types</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.rpt file</li>
  <li>.czr  file</li>
</ul>

<p>The .czr<img src="/versata-everest-docs/reports-manager/img/rm_czr_file.gif" alt="" /> file and the .rpt<img src="/versata-everest-docs/reports-manager/img/rm_rpt_file.gif" alt="" /> file have different icons to represent them.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>.rpt File</strong></dt>
  <dd>Reports created or modified using Business Objects Crystal  Reports are called Crystal reports. Crystal reports are files with .rpt  extension.</dd>
  <dt><strong>.czr File</strong></dt>
  <dd>When a crystal report file (.rpt file) is associated  with <strong>Everest</strong> by using the <strong>Reports Manager</strong>, a .czr file is created.  These files contain the parameter information, dialog information and  the .rpt file.</dd>
  <dd>The .czr files are registered with the <strong>Reports 
 Manager</strong> to allow these reports to be run from <strong>Everest</strong> using the database of the logged in company.</dd>
