<h1 id="using-customer-selection">Using Customer Selection</h1>

<p>You can use customer selection to execute the following:</p>

<p><strong>Sending mass e-mails</strong> - You can  send bulk e-mails to the customers who have e-mail addresses specified  in their profiles, in the displayed list.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If  you have tracked customers based on hobbies, you can send in e-mails announcing  special sales of sports goods to all those customers whose hobby has been  tagged with ‘Sports’.</p>

<p><strong>Sending faxes</strong> - You can send  faxes in bulk to customers who have fax numbers specified in their profile,  in the <strong>Tracking Selections</strong> list.</p>

<p><strong>Printing details</strong> - You can print  details of the selected customers for further action.</p>

<p>A few examples of situations where the <strong>Customer 
 Selection</strong> can be effectively used are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promotional  campaigns</li>
  <li>New  product announcements</li>
  <li>Sending  information on customer requests</li>
  <li>Requesting  current price lists</li>
  <li>News,  events and updates</li>
</ul>
