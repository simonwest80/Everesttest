<p>The <strong>Vendor Selection by Items</strong> option  provides a list of vendors whose purchase history includes or excludes  the items selected in the <strong>Vendor Selection 
 by Item</strong> dialog box.</p>

<p>Include List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the <strong>Include 
 list</strong> grid with details such as item code, description and item  stock status details. You will have to select the items in the <strong>Include 
 list</strong> that you have purchased from a vendor.</p>

<p>A vendor is included in the generated list, if you have purchased at  least one of the items selected in the <strong>Include</strong><strong>list</strong> from that vendor.</p>

<p>Exclude List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the <strong>Exclude</strong><strong>list</strong> grid with details such as  item code, description and item stock status details. Select the items  in the <strong>Exclude</strong> <strong>list</strong>  that you have not purchased from a vendor.</p>

<p>All vendors from whom you have purchased at least one of the items selected  in the <strong>Include</strong> <strong>list</strong>  and from whom you have NOT purchased any item selected in the <strong>Exclude</strong><strong>list</strong> is displayed in the generated  list.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  A  “Vendor Selection by Item” list needs to be generated for vendors  from whom you have purchased ‘HP Deskjet’  and ‘HP Laserjet’  printers but not ‘HP 2500C’ printer.</p>
