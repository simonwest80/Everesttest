  <dt><strong>Allow multiple selections to be tagged</strong></dt>
  <dd>If a group allows multiple selections, a record  can be tagged with more than one selection for the group. <strong>Everest</strong>  warns you with a message <strong>Disabling the 
 multiple tag option will not affect pre-existing selections. Are you sure 
 you want to change the setting?</strong> if you have pre-existing selections  and want to uncheck the above option. Click <strong>Yes</strong>  if you do not want to allow multiple selections to be tagged to documents.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If  multiple selection is allowed for the tracking group for purchase quotes  ‘Approval Status’  with tracking choices of ‘Approved by Purchase Manager’,  ‘Approved by Purchase Executive’,  and ‘Rejected’ a document can be tagged with more than one choice for  the group. This signifies that the document tagged with both ‘Approved  by Purchase Manager’  and ‘Approved by Purchase Executive’  has been approved by both.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/note.gif" alt="" /> If you have tagged a particular document with multiple choices  for the group, and after tagging, you try to clear the option <strong>Allow 
 Multiple Selection to be Tagged</strong>, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you that clearing the multiple selection option will not affect  existing selections tagged to documents and asks if you want to disable  the setting.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Transfer tags across documents</strong></dt>
  <dd>If you select this check box, the tags defined for  a document get transferred to the next document on conversion.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Refresh tag date if memo is updated</strong></dt>
  <dd>When an item is tagged with a choice, <strong>Everest</strong>  records the date of tagging. This option ensures that whenever you modify  the notes to the choice, the tag date gets updated, and is useful to record  the date and time when the memo was last updated.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If  a quote is tagged with the selection ‘Rejected’ for the group ‘Approval  Status’, you  can append the reasons for rejection as a note.</dd>
