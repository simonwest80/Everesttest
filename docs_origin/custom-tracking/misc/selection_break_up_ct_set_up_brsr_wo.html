<p>The <strong>Selection Break-up</strong> option  provides a percentage breakup of tracking choices made for a tracking  group in the specified period. When you select this option, you is  prompted to specify the date range for which you want the selection break-up.  Click <strong>OK</strong> after specifying the  <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong>  dates.</p>

<p>You will see a summary break up in the form of a pie chart. The selection  break-up is indicated for all tracking choices belonging to the selected  tracking group (to which work orders are tagged) during the specified  date range.</p>

<p>Place your cursor over each slice of the pie chart to view the number  of work orders that are tagged to the tracking choice. You can also  view these details by turning on the data editor.</p>
