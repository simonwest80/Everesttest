<p>This <strong>Selection Criteria for Customer 
 List</strong> dialog box permits you to specify a date range before generating  the customer list.</p>

<p><strong>Tagged Date From/Tagged Date To</strong></p>

<p>This option permits you to specify the dates between which the customers  must are tagged with the relevant selections in the Include and Exclude  Lists. A record that is tagged outside this range is not considered.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If  a customer is tagged with a selection in the Include List on April 15,  2001 and the date range specified is between March 1, 2000 to March 31,  2001, the customer will not figure in the list.</p>

<p>Specifying a date range enables you to narrow down the selection list.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  Let  us assume that you want a list of customers who are tagged within the  past week with the choice ‘Trade Show’  in the group ‘How Did You Hear About Us’. You can generate a list of such  customers by specifying the date range.</p>
