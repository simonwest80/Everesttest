<p>In any business environment, employees need to constantly interact with  customers and vendors, and regular correspondence is usually carried out  using an e-mail client. You can keep a track of all correspondences with  customers and vendors and link it to <strong>Everest</strong>  through the <strong>Everest MailBridge</strong>  utility.</p>

<p>The <strong>Everest MailBridge</strong> utility  identifies e-mails by matching their e-mail IDs with those specified in  the <strong>Customer</strong> or <strong>Vendor</strong>  address profiles and allows you to link customer e-mails sent from or  received in <strong>Everest</strong>, either as  a task or as an e-mail. Further, <strong>Everest</strong><strong>MailBridge</strong> also identifies e-mails  sent to or received from <strong>Everest</strong>  users in your organization by matching their e-mail IDs those defined  in the User profile.</p>

<p>With <strong>Everest MailBridge</strong>, you  can seamlessly link e-mails in <strong>Everest</strong>.  You can link existing e-mails received at an earlier date, by retrieving  them from the  e-mail  client and adding them to <strong>Everest</strong>  either as “tasks”or “e-mails”. You can also link e-mails you send from  the Inbox of your local mail client to <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>
