<h1 id="billing-address">Billing Address</h1>

<p>The vendor’s billing address is the address from where the vendor’s  invoice is sent. The billing address is specified in the <strong>Vendor</strong> profile <strong>- General</strong> tab.</p>

<p class="note">You can modify a vendor’s billing address by using the <strong>Modify 
 Address</strong> option (path: <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong>). This option  is enabled only for vendors whose billing address has been used while  creating final documents such as purchase invoices and debit memos.</p>

<p>When you modify a vendor’s billing address, <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the vendor.</li>
  <li>Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.</li>
</ul>

<p>The original address is retained on the purchase documents on which  it was used. The new address is used on new documents created for the  vendor.</p>

<p>A vendor can have only one billing address but may have any number of  return and contact addresses.</p>
