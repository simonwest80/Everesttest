<p>Time clocking is used to maintain a record of the number of hours an  employee works per day.</p>

<p>The system automatically clocks the start time (of the working hours),  when an employee’s name is entered. Only if the clock in time is validated,  can the employee be clocked out for the day.</p>

<p>When the employee name is re-selected the system automatically clocks  the end time (of the working hours), which is then validated. Validation  completes the clock out process. The employee cannot clock in again if  the validation process is not completed.</p>

<p>Clocking employee time keeps track of the following such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If employees  are on time.</li>
  <li>If employees  adhere to work shifts.</li>
  <li>The actual  number of hours worked in the office premises.</li>
  <li>The number  of hours employees were out on office work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time zone and daylight savings time details default from the client  workstation’s operating system settings and not the <strong>Everest</strong>  settings when recording a transaction. Once a transaction is saved, it  does not change even when viewed from different time zones or with different  daylight savings settings.</p>
