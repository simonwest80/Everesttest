<h1 id="the-clock-inout-dialog-box">The Clock In/Out Dialog Box</h1>

<p>The <strong>Clock</strong> <strong>In</strong>/<strong>Out</strong> dialog box allows you to record  the number of hours an employee worked in the office premises.</p>

  <dt><strong>Employee</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the employee code. This is a mandatory field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Time In</strong></dt>
  <dd>The time (start time) that the employee reports  for work is displayed. The  time displayed in this field is automatically obtained by the system from  the local workstation’s operating system settings when the Employee ID  is selected. Once recorded, this time does not change when viewed with  other time zone or daylight saving time (DST) settings.</dd>
  <dd>DST settings that change after  an employee clocks in but before clocking out impact only the clock out  time and not the clock in time.</dd>
</dl>
