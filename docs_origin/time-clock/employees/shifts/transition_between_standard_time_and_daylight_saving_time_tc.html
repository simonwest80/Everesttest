<h1 id="transition-between-standard-time-and-daylight-saving-time">Transition between Standard Time and Daylight Saving Time</h1>

<p>Starting in 2007, <strong>Daylight Saving Time</strong>  (DST) begins on the second Sunday in March, or as designated by state  or federal law, when clocks are moved forward one hour. <strong>Standard 
 Time</strong> (ST) begins again on the first Sunday in November, or as designated  by state or federal law, when clocks are moved backward one hour.</p>

<p>For most situations, this transition period is not a problem. But if  your organization operates on a 24-hour basis, additional adjustments  are needed twice a year during the transition between standard time and  daylight saving time to be sure that the employees who work during this  transition period are correctly compensated for their hours. It is important  that the organizational unit heads make adjustments for the employee work  shifts that occur during the transition. This adjustment should be made  during the current work cycle.</p>

<p>In March, when the transition is from ST to DST, the employees work  one less hour during the shift. Workers can be given the option to work  an additional hour or take an hour of available leave.</p>

<p>When the transition is from DST to ST in November, the employees work  and get paid for an additional hour.</p>
