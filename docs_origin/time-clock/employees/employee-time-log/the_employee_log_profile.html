<p>The <strong>Employee Log</strong> profile allows  you to enter the employee code, shift and the employee clock in/clock  out time. Once the Clocked In Time and Clocked Out Time is entered and  saved, it does not change when viewed with other time zone or daylight  saving time settings.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Code</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the unique code that identifies the employee.  This is a mandatory field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Shift</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the employee’s work shift. This is a mandatory  field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Clocked In Time</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the date and time that the employee clocked  in. By default, 12:00 AM gets displayed beside the date when you select  the date from the drop-down calendar. This is a mandatory field.</dd>
  <dd>Once this time is entered and saved, it does not  change when viewed with other time zone or daylight saving time (DST)  settings.</dd>
  <dd>DST settings that change after an employee clocks  in but before clocking out impact only the clock out time and not the  clock in time.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">On November 3, 2007, an employee clocks in  at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time changes at 2:00am on November 4, 2007.  The employee clocks out at 6:00am on November 4, 2007. The clock out time  of 6:00am is from the revised (changed) time.</p>
