<p>The Time clock feature allows you to maintain a record of the number  of hours spent by a visitor in the office premises.</p>

<p>The system automatically clocks the start time when the visitor’s name  is entered. It is imperative to validate the clock in time for the visitor  to be clocked out.</p>

<p>When the visitor’s name is  re-selected, the system automatically clocks the end time which is then  validated.</p>

<p>You can record other details including the organization the visitor  belongs to, purpose/nature of visit and the area to which access is permitted.</p>
