<p>Check this box if the leave you are applying for is partial, that is,  it is less than one working day.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/time-clock/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you take leave on the same day for 2 hours, it is considered as partial  leave, irrespective of whether you check the option or not.</p>

<p>If you specify the Start and End time as  9:00 and 11:00 for a week’s leave, it has two implications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you  check this box, the leave is considered as partial on all the 5 days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you  do not check this box, the leave is considered as partial only on the  last day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
