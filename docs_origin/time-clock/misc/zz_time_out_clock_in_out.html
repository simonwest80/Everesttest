<p>The time from your local workstation’s operating system settings is  automatically displayed in the Time Out field, when you select the code  of the employee who is leaving from work.</p>

<p>DST settings that change after an employee clocks in but before clocking  out impact only the clock out time and not the clock in time.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/time-clock/img/example.gif" alt="" />  On  October 28, 2006, an employee clocks in at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time  changes at 2:00am on October 29, 2006. The employee clocks out at 6:00am  on October 29, 2006. The clock out time of 6:00am is from the revised  (changed) time.</p>
