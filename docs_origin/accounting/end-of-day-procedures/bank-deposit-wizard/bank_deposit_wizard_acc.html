<p>The <strong>Everest Bank Deposit 
 Wizard</strong> is an easy to operate, one-screen wizard that allows you  to select all your receipts and collections over a day or a period, choose  the account for depositing the collections, and make any necessary adjustments.  The wizard automatically creates the General Journal for the bank deposits  for you along with the deposit slip. This helps you to avoid double entry  errors and eliminates the need to manually create a General Journal and  a deposit slip. You can quickly print a copy of the deposit slip to take  to the bank at the end of the day. After you make your selections and  save the Bank Deposit Wizard, the system flags the payments as <strong>Deposited</strong>  in the Payment Register.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bank Deposit Wizard</strong>  consists of three sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Filter section  (filters your undeposited receipts)</li>
  <li>The Top grid (allows  you to select undeposited receipts and provides details)</li>
  <li>The Bottom grid  (allows you to select the bank for the deposit and make any adjustments)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following steps must be completed to prepare a bank deposit:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong>  In the Filter section, set a filter for your undeposited receipts.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>  In the Top Grid, select the undeposited receipts to be deposited.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>  In the Bottom Grid, select the Bank to deposit the receipts.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong>  In the Adjustments section of the Bottom Grid, enter any adjustment amounts,  such as credit card transaction fees, and save the bank deposit. After  saving, you will be given the option to view the General Journal created  for the bank deposit and print the deposit slip to take to the bank.</p>
