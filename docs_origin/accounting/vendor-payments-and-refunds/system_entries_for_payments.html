<p><strong>Everest</strong> does not create system  journals for payments/refund entries from documents. Accounting entries  for vendor payments and refunds are entered in an open payment journal  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Works</strong><strong>tation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>  dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Workstation</strong> <strong>Settings &gt; Company Settings</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Journal 
 Group</strong> field) for the user entering the purchase/ purchase return.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user entering the payment/refund.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the description ‘Payment Journal’. All payments made from  a document are created in a journal with the description ‘Payment Journal’.</li>
  <li>The journal  must have the same bank account as the one specified for the payment method.</li>
</ul>

<p>If such an open journal does not exist, a new payment journal is created.</p>

<p>The payment journal number for the new journal is assigned from the  sequence number specified for payment journals in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location 
  </strong>&gt;  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Payment 
 journal #</strong> field) of the login location or the parent location of  the login sub-location.</p>

<p>If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or the parent  location of the login sub-location, the sequence number assigned to the  default location in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog  box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous tab &gt; Default Location</strong>  field) is assigned to the document.</p>
