<p>Payments made or refunds received from vendors can be accounted for  immediately or in a batch subsequently. The <strong>Batch</strong><strong>Payment Processing</strong> feature (path:  <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts 
 Payable</strong> &gt; <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment Processing</strong>) allows you to process  pending transactions in a batch, instead of processing the payments for  each document individually.</p>

<p>Payment/refund transactions in <strong>Everest</strong>  are recorded in the **Batch Payment Processing</p>
<ul>
  <li>Others** browser, if the <strong>Batch 
 Processing</strong> check box is selected on the <strong>Payment/Refund</strong>/<strong>Collection</strong> dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Your  process may require that the supervisor must review all payment/refund  transactions processed by the accounts payable clerk, before the accounting  entries are created. In such a case, the accounts payable clerk will select  the <strong>Batch Processing</strong> check box  on the <strong>Payment/Refund</strong>/<strong>Collection</strong>  dialog box. At the end of the day, the supervisor will view the <strong>Batch Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser  and process the accounting entries.</p>

<p>Thus the following transactions may be recorded in the <strong>Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payments on  a purchase order or purchase invoice</li>
  <li>Refunds on  a purchase order or purchase invoice</li>
  <li>Collections  on a debit order or debit memo</li>
  <li>Payments on  a debit order or debit memo</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Journal entries are not generated when transactions  are transferred to the <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser.  Irrespective of the type of payment method (whether cash, check, etc.),  when the transaction is processed, the payment is recorded in a payment  journal and accounting entries are generated.</p>

<p class="steps">To process the payment/refund/collection  transactions, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt;  <strong>Accounts</strong> <strong>Payable</strong>  &gt; <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment</strong><strong>Processing</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/vendor-payments-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_payment_processing_others_browser_options_ap.html"><strong>Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser</a>.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Batch Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser,  select the relevant records.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Process</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the transaction has been processed successfully, the records are  not displayed in the <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser  anymore.</p>
