<p>The back end processes when a transaction is purged from a payment journal  are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The vendor’s  unposted amount  and net balance is reduced, if the vendor was credited in the voided transaction;  the vendor’s unposted  amount increases, if the vendor was debited in the voided transaction.</li>
  <li>If the entry  type for payment was a miscellaneous deposit, the amount on the manual  purchase order that was created for the transaction is zeroed out.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If payment  discounts were recorded in the deleted journal/transaction, the <strong>Payment Discount</strong> field on the associated  purchase invoice changes based on the following rules:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field reduces by the amount credited to the purchase discount  account.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field increases by the amount debited to the purchase  discount account.</li>
</ul>
