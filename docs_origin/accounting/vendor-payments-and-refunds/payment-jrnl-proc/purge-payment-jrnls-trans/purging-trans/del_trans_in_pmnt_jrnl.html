<p>Transactions can be purged from the <strong>Payment 
 Journal</strong> profile only if the payment journal has not been posted.  A journal is deemed to be purged if all the transactions in the payment  journal are purged.</p>

<p>The transactions that cannot be purged are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A transaction  in a posted journal.</li>
  <li>Transactions  for system generated journals.</li>
  <li>An unposted  payment transaction for which a computerized check has been printed.</li>
  <li>A transaction  that was voided from the payment register.</li>
  <li>A transaction  that is a reversal entry for a transaction voided from the payment register.</li>
</ul>

<p>Purging a payment transaction can be done in three ways:</p>
