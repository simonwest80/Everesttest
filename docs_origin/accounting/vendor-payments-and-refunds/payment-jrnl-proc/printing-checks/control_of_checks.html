<h1 id="control-of-checks">Control of Checks</h1>

<p>Payment is usually made by check, often in a multi-copy format. Using  a computer, may reduce the need for the extra copies. Nonetheless, you  may at least choose to keep a copy attached to the invoice and file by  vendor and/or by month. Additionally, you can keep the copies of the checks  in chronological order of the check numbers for easy retrieval at a later  date.</p>

<p>The most important controls in the payments function generally include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Limiting access  to the blank checks.</li>
  <li>Limiting access  to authorized persons (a security function you can set in <strong>Everest</strong>).</li>
  <li>The signing  of checks by an individual with proper authority i.e. the authorized signatory.</li>
  <li>Separation  of responsibility for preparing and signing of checks.</li>
  <li>Restricting  access to creation of payment or refund entries.</li>
  <li>Careful examination  of the supporting documentation by the person who signs the check (the  vendor invoice should agree with the purchase invoice document or transaction  you created in <strong>Everest</strong>).</li>
  <li>The checks  should be pre-numbered and printed on special paper that makes it difficult  to alter the check details like name or amount.</li>
  <li>Care should  be taken to physically control blank, voided, and signed checks before  they are mailed.</li>
  <li>It is also  important to have a method of canceling the supporting documents to prevent  their reuse as support for another check at a later time. A common method  is to write or stamp the check number on the supporting documents.</li>
  <li>Check with  your CPA and lawyer for the proper control of checks, check writing process,  etc, within your business operation.</li>
</ul>
