<p>The <strong>Multiple Payments</strong> browser  provides a detailed break up of the vendors and the documents that have  been selected for payment. Documents whose creation date is after the  login date are not included in this browser.</p>

<p>This browser is displayed when the <strong>Finish</strong> button is pressed in the <strong>Multiple 
 Payments Wizard</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>To select a document for payment:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the check  box beside the document number.</li>
  <li>All documents can  be selected for payment by selecting <strong>Options 
 &gt; Select All</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Un 
 Select All</strong> option in the <strong>Options</strong> menu deselects  all the documents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A payment transaction is created based on the  following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A transaction is  created for each selected vendor.</li>
  <li>The purchase invoices  are set off against the debit memos in arriving at the amount payable.</li>
  <li>In the case of  manual checks, a transaction is created for all documents (purchase invoices  and debit memos) having the same check number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Computerized check amounts are automatically consolidated.</p>

<p>If the total amount on debit memos is greater than the total amounts  outstanding on purchase invoices, the excess is presumed to be refunded  by the vendor.</p>

<p>The information available in the <strong>Multiple 
 Payments</strong> browser is categorized under the following heads:</p>
