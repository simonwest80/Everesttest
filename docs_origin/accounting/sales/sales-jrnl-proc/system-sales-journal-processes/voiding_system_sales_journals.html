<p>System sales journals cannot be voided. However errors could occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The sales invoice/credit memo could have been created for the wrong customer.</li>
  <li>The sales invoice could have been created for the wrong amount.</li>
  <li>The wrong quantity of items could have been shipped.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such errors can be rectified either by modifying the documents, creating new documents or creating miscellaneous adjustment entries.</p>
