<p>The processes that occur in the back end when a sales journal is posted  are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sales invoice  transactions will increase the customer’s posted amount and reduce the  unposted amount  with the net balance remaining the same.</li>
  <li>Credit memo  transactions will decrease the customer’s posted amount and increase the  unposted amount  with the net balance remaining the same.</li>
  <li>The period  balances for the account, its parent account and all the accounts higher  than the parent in the COA hierarchy are updated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The status  of sales invoices and credit memos displayed in the status bar of the  document changes to <strong>Posted</strong>.</li>
