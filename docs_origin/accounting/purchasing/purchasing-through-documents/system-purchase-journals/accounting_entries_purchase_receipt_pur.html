<h1 id="accounting-entries---purchase-receipt">Accounting Entries - Purchase Receipt</h1>

<p>The accounting entries that are created when a purchase receipt is created  depend on the inventory type of the items purchased.</p>

<p>The accounting entries are categorized under the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/entry_for_inventoried_items_create_a_pr.html">Accounting  Entry for Inventoried Items</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/entry_for_non_inventoried_items_create_a_pr.html">Accounting  Entry for Non-inventoried Items</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accounting Entries for Documents Containing Line  Items Associated to Different Accounts</strong></p>

<p>A purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo may consist of more than one  line item with different accounts to be debited for purchase cost or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated for each account by accumulating the  amounts for each account.</p>

<p>At the document level you can identify the location or sub-location  to which the income or expense account pertains to in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column of the items details grid.</p>

<p>Since expense and income accounts can be accounted for each location/sub-location  separately, the amounts for such type of accounts are accumulated for  each account and location combination.</p>

<p>If job codes are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated  for each account, location/sub-location and job code combination separately.</p>
