<p>A journal’s status can either be ‘Open’ or ‘Locked’. An open journal  is one that is available for transaction entry. You would mark a journal  as locked when transactions no longer need to be made to that journal.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/note.gif" alt="" />  Initially  a manual purchase journal is assigned the status ‘locked’.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> will append system generated  transactions to the first related open journal of the accounting period  in question. If a journal is locked, it is closed for system transactions  and another journal is created for any new system generated transactions.</p>

<p>Only the status of journals that are not posted can be modified.</p>

<p><strong>When would you lock a journal?</strong></p>

<p>You might want <strong>Everest</strong> to generate  the transactions in a different journal for a variety of reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Journals are  normally locked at the end of an accounting period. However, if the number  of transactions grows too large, you may decide to lock it before the  accounting period.</li>
  <li>Journals created  for a specific purpose such as accounting for adjusting entries, accounting  for writing off old customer balances or miscellaneous purchases are locked  when all transactions required have been added to the journal.</li>
  <li>Journals may  also be locked after printing to ensure that new entries are not added;  as new entries may not be printed.</li>
  <li>Journals may  be locked after you verify them to ensure that no new entries are added.</li>
</ul>
