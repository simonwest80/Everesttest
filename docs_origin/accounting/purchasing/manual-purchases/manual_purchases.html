<ul>
  <li>When you purchase  items or services that you do not regularly deal with.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Assets that you purchase for your business.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the amount  payable is fixed and is a recurring item or service.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Rent paid for your office or warehouse premises</p>

<p>Housekeeping charges</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you want  to create debit memos to write off miscellaneous amounts outstanding to  vendors.</li>
