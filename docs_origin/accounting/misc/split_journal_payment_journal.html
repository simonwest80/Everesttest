<p>You can split journals so that the selected transaction(s)  are moved to a new journal. This option is useful in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you want  to post only some transactions in a journal; you can then split the journal  and post the required transactions.</li>
  <li>When the journal  that is not posted contains too many transactions, and you want to reduce  the number of transactions contained in the journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The original journal must have at least one transaction after splitting.  A new journal is created with the same journal information as the original  journal but with a new journal number.</p>

<p class="steps">To split a journal, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Unposted Payment Journals</strong> browser, select  <strong>Options &gt; List Transaction</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Payment Journal Transactions</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Payment Journal Transactions</strong> browser,  highlight the required transaction(s).  Select <strong>Options &gt; Split Journal</strong>.</li>
  <li>You will see  the <strong>Confirm</strong> window. Click <strong>OK</strong> to split the journal.</li>
</ul>

<p>A new payment journal is created with the <strong>Locked</strong> status, containing the transaction(s)  that was/were selected.</p>
