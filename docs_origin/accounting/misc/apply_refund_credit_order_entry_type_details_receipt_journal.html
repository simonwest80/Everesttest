<p>Select this option if the deposit made to a customer on a credit order  has to be applied to a credit memo or another credit order or is being  refunded by the customer.</p>

<p>If you apply the deposit made on the credit order to a credit memo,  the Customer Deposit will be credited and the Accounts Receivable account  will be debited. If you receive a refund, the Bank Account associated  with the selected payment method is debited and the Customer Deposit account  is credited.</p>

<p>When this entry type is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Credit 
 Order</strong> number must be specified in the <strong>Document 
 #</strong> column of the <strong>Transaction Entries</strong>  section.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">When you select the <strong>Apply/Refund 
 Credit Order</strong> option to apply the payment to another document, you  will have to follow it with a transaction entry of type <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/refund_credit_memo_entry_types_rptjrnl.html">Refund  Credit Memo</a> or <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/deposit_on_credit_order_entry_types_receipt_journals.html">Deposit  on Credit Order</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Customer 
 Deposit</strong> account specified in the <strong>Accounting</strong>  dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting 
 &gt; Control Accounts</strong> tab) can only be credited.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Credit</strong> column automatically displays the amount of deposit made  on the selected credit order that has not yet been applied to other documents.</li>
