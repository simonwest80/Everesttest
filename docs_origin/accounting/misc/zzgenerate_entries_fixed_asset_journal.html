<ul>
  <li><strong>One</strong>  - When this option is selected, a single depreciation entry is generated.  The transaction amount is the sum total of the amount displayed in the  <strong>Depreciation (per month)</strong> field  of each selected asset’s profile.</li>
  <li><strong>Till 
 Date</strong> - Select this option to generate the depreciation entries  upto the transaction  date. A consolidated depreciation entry for all the months from the last  generation date to the current date is created.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  monthly depreciation of an asset is $10000 and the last generation was  done on December 31, 2000. If the date of next generation is May 31, 2001,  selecting ‘One entry’ will create a depreciation entry for $10000. If  the option ‘Till date’ is selected, then a single depreciation entry would  be created for $50,000 from January to May.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/note.gif" alt="" />  Depreciation  is not prorated based on the transaction date. If a depreciation entry  is created in the middle of a month, then the depreciation is calculated  for the entire month.</p>
