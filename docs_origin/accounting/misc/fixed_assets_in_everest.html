<p>Setting up fixed assets in <strong>Everest</strong>  enables you to compute depreciation automatically. You could even calculate  depreciation yourself and use a general journal transaction to record  such activity. Many clients find that using a spread sheet is a more accurate  way of tracking fixed assets if you have a large number of assets and  find that your asset allocation changes frequently.</p>

<p>Discuss the legal fixed asset issues such as the capitalizable  value, original cost, useful life, regulated tax life, salvage value,  etc., with your CPA and/or Tax Lawyer. They can offer additional insights  and relate the discussion to your particular needs, as they know the legal  options and your business, operational and personal philosophies. Proper  choices and record keeping can also effect you cash flow and bottom line.  Our comments are general in nature.</p>
