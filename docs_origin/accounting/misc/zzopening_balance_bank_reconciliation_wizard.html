<p>When performing the bank reconciliation process for the first time,  the opening balance is the opening balance for the period as shown in  your bank statement. After the account has been reconciled the statement  balance mentioned in the previous reconciliation process is displayed  automatically as the opening balance. This field can be edited if required.</p>

<p>If you have attempted to reconcile the account previously without completing  it (i.e. saved the reconciliation details without completing the reconciliation),  the statement balance mentioned during the previous reconciliation process  is displayed automatically in this field.</p>

<p>You can enter a maximum of 15 integers and 4 decimals in the <strong>Opening 
 Balance</strong> field. When the account as per your bank statement has  a debit balance enter the balance as a negative figure in this field.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  number of decimals displayed in this field depends on the number of decimal  digits specified in the settings for the bank currency in the <strong>Currency</strong> profile (Path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Multi-Currency &gt; Currency</strong>). The number  of decimals displayed in this field depends on what you have set up in  the <strong>Currency</strong> profile. If the number  of decimals has not been specified in the currency profile, then the number  of decimals specified in the locale selected for the currency is displayed.</p>
