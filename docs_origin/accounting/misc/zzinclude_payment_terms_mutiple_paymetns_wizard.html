<p>Documents that contain the payment terms specified in this column will  be selected for payment. By default, all the payment terms that have been  defined are displayed in this column but you have the option of excluding  payment terms, if required. To exclude a payment term, highlight it and  click on the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/act_exclude.gif" alt="" /> button. Clicking on the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/act_exclude_all.gif" alt="" /> button  moves all the payment terms to the exclude column.</p>
