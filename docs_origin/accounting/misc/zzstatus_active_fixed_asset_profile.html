<p>This option is used to specify whether the fixed asset is Active or Inactive. <strong>Everest</strong> will default to Active when you are creating a new fixed asset and will automatically change the status to Inactive when the asset is fully depreciated. You would change the status to Inactive if the fixed asset has been disposed off. The status of the asset is active when the check box is selected.</p>

<p>When this check box is not selected, it signifies the asset is fully depreciated. Or if the asset has been sold or disposed off, then the status signifies that the asset does not exist.  If an asset has been sold, the status has to be manually changed.</p>
