<p>Use this option to provisionally post the highlighted journal. <strong>Everest</strong> will verify that the journals  are balanced and will commence the provisional posting process.</p>

<p>When a journal is provisionally posted, the respective accounts’ posted  balances do not change. However, the provisionally posted amount can be  included in the account balance that appears in the financial statements.</p>

<p>When a journal is provisionally posted, new transactions cannot be added  even if its status is <strong>Open</strong>. When  you open a provisionally posted journal, you are informed that it can  be opened only for viewing. In effect, its status is similar to that of  a closed journal. To use the journal, the journal has to be provisionally  un-posted.</p>
