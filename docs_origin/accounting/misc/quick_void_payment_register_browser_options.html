<p>Use this option to account for a check without creating a payment/receipt  transaction.</p>

<p class="example">If you have printed a batch of checks and  one among them was spoiled, you can keep track of that check without having  to create a transaction for it by using the <strong>Quick 
 Void</strong> option.</p>
