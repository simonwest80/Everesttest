<p>This browser is displayed when <strong>Options 
 &gt; List Transaction</strong> is selected from the <strong>Unposted 
 Payment Journals</strong> browser. The <strong>Payment 
 Journal Transactions</strong> browser lists all the transactions in the  journal with details such as the vendor code, bank code and amounts debited  or credited, whether the payment is made by a manual/computer check and  whether the check has been printed.</p>

<p>If payment is made through a credit card, the card number is displayed  in the <strong>Reference</strong> column. Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last four="" digits="" of="" the="" card=""> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).</last></p>

  <li><strong>Void</strong>  – The transaction that has been voided is assigned <strong>Void</strong>  status.</li>
  <li><strong>Reversed</strong>  – The original transaction that has been reversed using <strong>Reverse</strong>  option is assigned <strong>Reversed</strong> status.</li>
  <li><strong>Reversal</strong>  – The new transaction that is the opposite of the original transaction  is assigned <strong>Reversal</strong> status.</li>
</ul>
