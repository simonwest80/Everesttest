<p>The <strong>Payment Journal Payment Method 
 Summary</strong> browser is displayed when the <strong>Payment 
 Method (Summary)</strong> (path: <strong>Unposted 
 Payment Journals</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Transactions &gt; Payment Method (Summary)</strong>) option is selected.  This browser lists all the payment methods through which payments have  been made to vendors or refunds received from vendors, and the net amount  debited or credited with that payment method.</p>

<p>A net credit (indicated by ‘CR’  in the <strong>Type</strong> column) denotes that  the payments made through the selected method exceed receipts with that  method. A net debit (indicated by ‘DR’ in the <strong>Type</strong> column) denotes that receipts exceed payments.</p>
