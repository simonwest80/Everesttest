<p>Use this field to specify the date of the closing balance in the bank  statement. This date cannot be later than the login date.</p>

<p>When you specify this date, transactions of the account upto  this date are displayed in the <strong>Bank Reconciliation</strong> browser.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you receive the bank statement for the period July 2001, on 15th August  2001, specify the date in this field as July 31, 2001. Transactions that  have been accounted after this date will not be displayed in the Bank  Reconciliation browser. This simplifies the reconciliation process.</p>
