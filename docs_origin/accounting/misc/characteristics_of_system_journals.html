<ul>
  <li>Entries cannot  be added manually to the journal.</li>
  <li>Entries cannot  be modified from the journal; you should modify the base document to change  the entry.</li>
  <li>System journals  cannot be purged.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> also creates automatic  entries in Payment and Receipt journals when recording payments against  a purchase order, purchase invoice, debit memo, sales order, sales invoice  and credit memo. But such payment entries are not made in system journals.  These entries can be modified from within the journal.</p>
