<p>Enter the check number from which you want the printing to commence.  By default, the next check number for the bank account selected in the  payment/receipt journal is displayed in this field. You can change this  number if required.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  a new checkbook has been issued, enter the next check number in this field.</p>

<p>If you have issued one of the checks in a  series manually, you will have to enter the next number in this field.  For instance, if you have printed checks upto  check # 2000 and you issue check number 2001 manually, you must enter  2002 in this field when you are issuing the next check.</p>

<p>Checks are printed in order of the transaction number. Thus the first  check will be used for the first transaction, the second for the next  and so on.</p>
