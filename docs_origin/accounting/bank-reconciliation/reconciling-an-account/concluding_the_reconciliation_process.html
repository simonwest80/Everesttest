<p class="steps">To conclude the bank reconciliation process,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Bank Reconciliation</strong> browser, tag all  the payments/deposits that are present in the bank statement.</li>
  <li>Create adjustment  entries if required to account for any charges that have been overlooked.</li>
  <li>When the difference  has been eliminated, select <strong>Options &gt; 
 Save Changes</strong>. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to  save the details.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>. You will then be informed that  your records have been reconciled.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage you have three options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mark 
 Reconciled</strong> - Click <strong>Mark Reconciled</strong> to mark all the entries that have been marked as cleared and the  bank account as reconciled. You will then be asked if you want to print  the reconciliation report. The <strong>Reconciliation 
 Report</strong> option in the <strong>Options</strong> menu  also enables you to print the reconciliation report. The details are saved  and the adjustment entry, if any, is automatically posted.</li>
</ul>

<p>This will mark all the payment and deposit  transactions that are cleared/selected as reconciled. Transactions marked  as reconciled are displayed in the <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> with the status <strong>Reconciled</strong>.</p>

<p class="hint">Once the Bank account is reconciled by selecting  this option, the <strong>Bank Reconciliation 
 Statement</strong> cannot be printed. You must therefore ensure that this  statement is printed before marking the account as reconciled.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Save 
 &amp; Exit</strong> - Click <strong>Save &amp; 
 Exit</strong> to save the reconciliation details and return to the <strong>Everest</strong> main screen. Use this option  when you want to continue reconciling the account at a later date. When  you return to the reconciliation, the statement balance and the entries  tagged will be automatically displayed.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue</strong> - Click <strong>Continue</strong> if you  have not yet completed the reconciliation and want to return to the Bank  Reconciliation browser.</li>
</ul>
