<p>The <strong>Mark Reconciled</strong> option will  be displayed only when the statement is reconciled with the bank account.  You can quit the reconciliation process at any point of time and return  to it at a later date.</p>

<p class="steps">To save the incomplete reconciliation, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Bank Reconciliation</strong> browser, select  <strong>Options &gt; Save</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you to confirm whether the incomplete reconciliation details have  to be saved.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to save the details. Click <strong>No</strong> to exit the reconciliation without  saving any details. Click <strong>Cancel</strong>  to return to the <strong>Bank Reconciliation</strong>  browser and continue with the process of reconciliation.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you return to the reconciliation, the statement balance and the  entries tagged will be automatically displayed.</p>
