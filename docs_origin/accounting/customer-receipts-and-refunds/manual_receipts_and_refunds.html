<p>Manual receipts and refunds refer to accounting entries made in an existing  or new receipt journal for customer receipts and refunds. Although the  accounting entries are made manually, <strong>Everest</strong>  updates the documents against which these receipts or refunds are made.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/note.gif" alt="" />  If  receipts or refunds are made from a document, then <strong>Everest</strong>  automatically calculates the discount available for the payment term.  If you make a manual receipt entry, then you also have to manually calculate  the discount available.</p>
