<p>Credit card transactions with type “Sale”, “Refund”  or “Sale or Authorize” are recorded in the <strong>Batch 
 Payment Process - New Sale or Refund</strong> browser (path: <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> <strong>Receivable</strong>  &gt; <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment</strong><strong>Processing</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong><strong>Sale</strong> <strong>or</strong><strong>Refund</strong>).</p>

<p>The following transactions are also displayed in this browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web orders  whose payment method is associated with a ICVerify  processor.</li>
  <li>Sales Orders  that are imported with the payment preference set to “No payment  has been processed”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Process Transactions</p>

<p>When you process (path: <strong>Batch</strong><strong>Payment Process</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Process</strong>)  these transactions, they are first authorized (you will see the <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Card</strong><strong>Authorization</strong> dialog box) and  the approval code is obtained. The funds are also captured immediately.</p>

<p>Once the transactions have been approved, journal entries are generated  in the relevant journals and the transaction will not be visible in the  <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment 
 Process – New Sale or Refund</strong> browser. If however, you reduce the  <strong>Payment Amount</strong>, and the document  continues to have a balance after the transaction is processed, the remaining  payment amount continues to be displayed in the browser so that you can  process it later.</p>

<p class="example">If the sale transaction is for $1000, and  you process only $750 due to lack of funds, the accounting entry is created  for $750. The transaction continues to be displayed in the browser with  a payment amount of $250 (1000-750).</p>
