<p>Multiple receipts can be used for processing a batch of payments received from multiple customers.</p>

<p>You can use the <strong>Multiple Receipts</strong> option to view a browser of all outstanding customer invoices and credits that have become due as of the specified date. Receipts against the invoices can be processed from the browser and appropriate receipts journals will be created automatically.</p>

<p>The <strong>Multiple Receipts Wizard</strong> guides you through this process. The steps in this wizard are listed in the left panel of the Wizard.</p>
