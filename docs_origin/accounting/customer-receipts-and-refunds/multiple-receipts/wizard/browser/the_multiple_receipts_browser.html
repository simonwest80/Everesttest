<p>The multiple receipts browser provides a detailed break up of the customers  and the documents selected for payment.</p>

<p>Documents whose creation date is after the login date are not included  in this browser.</p>

<p>This browser is displayed when the <strong>Finish</strong> button is pressed in the <strong>Multiple 
 Receipts Wizard</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>To select a document for payment:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the  check box beside the document number. The <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/the_manual_check_profile_mult_rpts.html"><strong>Manual Check</strong> profile</a> is displayed.  Enter the check number in the <strong>Check #</strong> field and select the date of payment. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the details.</li>
  <li>All documents  can be selected for payment by selecting <strong>Options 
 &gt; Select All</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Un 
 Select All</strong> option in the <strong>Options</strong> menu deselects  all the documents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A receipt transaction is created based on the  following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A transaction  is created for each selected customer.</li>
  <li>The sales invoices  are set off against the credit memos in arriving at the amount receivable.</li>
  <li>In the case  of manual checks, a transaction is created for all documents (sales invoices  and credit memos) having the same check number.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the total amount on credit memos is greater than the total amounts  outstanding on sales invoices, the excess is presumed to be refunded to  the customer.</p>

<p>The information available in the <strong>Multiple 
 Receipts</strong> browser is categorized under the following heads:</p>
