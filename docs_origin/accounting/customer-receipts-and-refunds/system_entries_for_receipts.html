<p><strong>Everest</strong> does not create system  journals for receipts/refund entries from documents. Accounting entries  for customer receipts and refunds are entered in an open receipt journal  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the one selected in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Workstation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>) of the user entering the purchase/purchase return.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user entering the payment/refund.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the description ‘Receipts Journal’.</li>
  <li>The journal  must have the same bank account as the bank account specified for the  payment method.</li>
</ul>

<p>If such an open journal does NOT exist, a new receipt journal is created.</p>

<p>The receipt journal number for the new journal is assigned from the  sequence number specified for receipt journals in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Receipt journal #</strong> field)  of the login location or the parent location of the login sub-location.</p>

<p>If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or the parent  location of the login sub-location, the sequence number assigned to the  default location is assigned to the document. The default location is  specified in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog  box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Default Location</strong> field).</p>
