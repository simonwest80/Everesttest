<p>Receipt details cannot be modified from the document on which the receipt/refund  was made. These details can however be modified from the <strong>Receipt 
 Journal</strong> profile. You can make such modifications only till the  journal is posted.</p>

<p>The following modifications are possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New transactions  can be added.</li>
  <li>Existing transactions  can be deleted.</li>
  <li>Certain fields  can be modified.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a manual sales order is created for entry type ‘Miscellaneous Deposit’,  then the document number cannot be changed; but the entry can be deleted.  When the amount in an entry is modified, <strong>Everest</strong>  also updates the amounts received against the documents.</p>

<p>If details other than those listed below need to be rectified, you would  have to void the receipt journal and recreate the entries.</p>
