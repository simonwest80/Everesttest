<h1 id="fixed-assets">Fixed Assets</h1>

<p>Assets not readily convertible to cash that are used in the normal course  of business are called fixed assets. Such assets are tangible and are  acquired for use in operating the business.</p>

<p>Typically, they include the following items used in business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buildings owned</li>
  <li>Land on which  the buildings reside</li>
  <li>Vehicles</li>
  <li>Equipment</li>
  <li>Tools</li>
</ul>

<p>These assets are used in the production and/or sale of other assets  or services. Fixed assets are frequently called Operating Assets or Property,  Plant &amp; Equipment.</p>

<p>The amounts reported as fixed assets on the balance sheet do not represent  their fair-market values. They depict the book value or carrying value  of the asset. The cost of a fixed asset is measured and recorded at the  acquisition date. It is not re-measured at subsequent balance sheet dates,  other than for the expense allocation towards <a href="javascript:BSSCPopup('/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/depreciation.html');" id="A1">depreciation</a><script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovFilePopupInit('A1');
//--></script>  (and possibly obsolescence or casualty loss).</p>

<p>This implies that your balance sheet will display the fixed assets at  their acquisition cost minus the depreciation (i.e. accumulated apportionment  to expense of that cost). This is in accordance with the cost principle  associated within accounting guidelines and IRS regulations.</p>
