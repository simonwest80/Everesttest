<p>Memorized transactions are transactions that you save (“memorize”) in  the system as a template which can be retrieved at a later date and used  again. This feature is ideal to use for repetitive transactions that occur  several times in a period or year since it eliminates the need to create  the journal transactions every time.</p>

<p>You can create templates of memorized transactions for transactions  that are the same each month, such as rent, and also for repetitive transactions  that only vary by amount. In the case of varying amounts, you can create  a template with $0 (zero) transaction amounts and enter the actual figures  after you retrieve the template. If you know the exact amounts, you can  create a template with the known amounts. Either way, you can make any  necessary modifications when creating the transactions using the template.</p>

<p class="example">A company pays $120 for annual car insurance. They credit the vendor  for $120, debit Prepaid Insurance, and send a check to the vendor for  $120. At the end of each month, in the General Journal, they must credit  Prepaid Insurance and debit Insurance Expense for $10. Instead of manually  entering these GL transactions each month, they open a new general journal,  add the monthly transactions, and use the “Memorize Transactions” option  to save these as a template called “Monthly Car Insurance Expense”.</p>

<p>At the end of every month, they can open a new General Journal profile  and use the “Retrieve Memorized Transactions” option to retrieve these  transactions into the GL. They modify the date and description and save  the GL profile. This saves them precious time at the busy end of the month.</p>

<p>The most efficient way to process your memorized transactions if you  know when the transactions will occur ahead of time is to schedule the  transactions. Scheduling your memorized transactions automates retrieving  the templates into the journals for processing. When scheduled, your Accounting  Staff can quickly and easily process the transactions directly from a  reminder they receive. Refer to the “<a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/memorized-transactions/how_do_i_schedule_memorized_transactions_acc.html">How  do I Schedule Memorized Transactions?</a>” section for more information.</p>
