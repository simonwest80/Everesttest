<p>The following system general journals are always created in base currency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inventory adjustments</li>
  <li>Stock transfers</li>
  <li>Import of item  balances</li>
  <li>Depreciation</li>
  <li>Opening balances</li>
  <li>Year end closing</li>
</ul>

<p>Adjusting entries for bank accounts in a different currency are translated  into the base currency and displayed.</p>

<p>A general journal transaction may be created for accounts in a currency  different from the base currency. The amounts of debit or credit may be  entered either in the foreign currency or the base currency.</p>

<p>The transaction view is initially in base currency. Switch to the foreign  currency view by selecting the option <strong>View 
 in Foreign Currency</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Exchange Rate</strong></p>

<p>The exchange rate against your base currency is displayed in this field.</p>
