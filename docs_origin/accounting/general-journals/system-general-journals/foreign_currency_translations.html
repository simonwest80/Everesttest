<h1 id="foreign-currency-translations">Foreign Currency Translations</h1>

<p>When the document currency is a foreign currency, the amounts in foreign  currency are translated into the base currency using the exchange rate  for the document.</p>

<p>The translation formula applied depends on the quote type.</p>

<p><strong>Where the quote type is Foreign to Base, the  translation formula is:</strong></p>

<p>Foreign Currency Amount * (Exchange Rate/Quote Amount)</p>

<p><strong>Where the quote type is Base to Foreign, the  translation formula is:</strong></p>

<p>Foreign Currency Amount * (Quote Amount /Exchange Rate)</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  your base currency is the US Dollar and the currency of the account is  Great Britain Pounds (GBP), and the rate is expressed as 1 GBP = 1.42064;  then 1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote type foreign to  base as 1000* (1.42064/1) = 1420.64.</p>

<p>If the rate is expressed as 1 USD = 0.703973  GBP, then 1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote type base  to foreign as 1000* (1/0.703973) = 1420.64.</p>
