<p>You can print general journals before you post them in order to ensure  that you have a backup. This also acts as an excellent audit trail.</p>

<p>By default, <strong>Everest</strong>’s Flow Control  Preferences are configured to require you to print each journal before  posting it to the ledgers. Although the flow control preferences does  allow you to disable this requirement, it is not recommended.</p>

<p>You cannot, however, print a voided journal.</p>

<p class="steps">To print a general journal, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting &gt; General 
 Journal</strong>. You will see the <strong>Unposted 
 General Journals</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  required journal(s)  and select <strong>Options &gt; Print Journal(s)</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Printing 
 Preferences</strong> dialog box from where you can preview and print  the journals.</li>
  <li>After previewing/printing  the journal, you will see the <strong>Mark selected 
 journals as printed</strong> dialog box. Select <strong>Marked 
 as printed</strong> if the journal has printed correctly and <strong>Abort</strong> to cancel the process.</li>
  <li>If your flow  control preference has been set up to disallow posting until the journal  has been printed, the journal can only be posted if you select the <strong>Marked as printed</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
