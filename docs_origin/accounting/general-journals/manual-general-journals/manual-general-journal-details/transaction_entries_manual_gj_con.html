 &gt; View in Foreign Currency</strong> is selected.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Exchange Rate</strong></dt>

  <dt><strong>Notes</strong></dt>
  <dd>Notes provide a brief description of the transaction.  You may enter a note for each transaction entry.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Job code</strong></dt>
  <dd>The job code identifies the job to which the expense  or revenue on this transaction must be allocated.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Allocate</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the <strong>Allocate</strong>  check box for the transaction entries that you would like to distribute  or “allocate” among accounts based on a percentage. The total percentage  of these accounts should equal 100%.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="steps">To allocate transactions based on a percentage,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the <strong>Allocate</strong> check box for each transaction  entry that you would like to distribute based on a percentage.</li>
  <li>Indicate the percentage  for each transaction selected in the <strong>% 
 Allocation</strong> field. The Debit/Credit amounts automatically calculate  based on the percentages entered. This feature can increase the efficiency  of your Accounting staff and save valuable time, especially at month end,  since they do not have to calculate the transaction amounts manually.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">An Accountant would like to allocate petty  cash between Bank Account A and Bank Account B. 40% should go to Bank  Account A and 60% should go to Bank Account B. For Bank Account A, they  select the Allocate check box and enter 40 in the % Allocation field.  For Bank Account B, they select the Allocate check box and enter 60 in  the % Allocation field. Since the Debit amount to Petty Cash is $100,  this amount automatically allocates as a $40.00 credit to Bank Account  A and a $60.00 credit to Bank Account B.</p>
