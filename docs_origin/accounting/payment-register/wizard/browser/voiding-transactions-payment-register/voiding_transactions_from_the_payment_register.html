<p>When a transaction is voided from the payment register, the transaction  balance is set to $0.00 and the customer or vendor associated with the  transaction is removed. Also, all the document details will get removed.</p>

<p>You can void a transaction from the <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> or from the documents through the <strong>Payment 
 History</strong> screen. You can view the voided transaction in the V<strong>oided Transactions</strong> browser and the <strong>Payment Register</strong> browser. You can also  recreate the voided transaction, if necessary.</p>

<p>The following table shows the screens and browsers where the voided  transactions display:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Screen</td>
      <td>Voided Transaction will appear?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Document Payment History screen</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transaction History screen</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Payment/Receipt journal browser</td>
