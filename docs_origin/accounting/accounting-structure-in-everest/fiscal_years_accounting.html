<p>A fiscal year is the accounting year defined for a company. This is  based on the ‘Time Period’  concept, which states that accounting reports the results of operations  and financial position for time periods of equal length. These reports  are required for outside entities such as creditors, the government and  investors (to ascertain the financial health of the company). Companies  normally use the time period of a year for accounting purposes. This is  the accounting or the fiscal year.</p>

<p>In certain situations, a fiscal year can be greater or lesser than a  year.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  a new company starts business in the middle of the year and the calendar  year is its fiscal year, its first fiscal year will be lesser than a year.</p>

<p>If a company’s fiscal year is January  - December, and from 2003 it wants to adopt April - March as the fiscal  year, the fiscal year 2003 may be extended by 3 months to March 2003.</p>

<p>Setting up a fiscal year is the first step in the accounting process  in <strong>Everest</strong>. <em>**</em> The fiscal year to which an accounting entry belongs is determined  by the transaction date.</p>
