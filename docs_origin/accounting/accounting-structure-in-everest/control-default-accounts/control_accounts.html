<h1 id="control-accounts">Control Accounts</h1>

<p>Control accounts comprise individual balances of all related accounts.</p>

<p class="example">The Inventory Control Account comprises the  values of all items in inventory.</p>

<p>Control accounts are used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For 
 feasibility</strong> - When it is impractical to maintain a ledger account  for each related item.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Maintaining an inventory account for each  item in stock would lead to a large COA.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For 
 better financial analysis</strong> - Control accounts ensure that all related  items are routed through one account. This helps better financial analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Accountants frequently use financial ratios  such as Stock Turnover and Working Capital Ratio that require the total  value of inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Using a  control account for these ensures that all relevant account balances are  included in the analysis.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>To 
 prevent errors</strong> - Identifying control accounts ensures that important  items of expenditure/revenue are accounted correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Identifying the inventory control will ensure  that inventory is not accounted in any account other than the identified  asset account.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>For 
 faster processing -</strong> Control accounts facilitate automatic processing  of transactions as the user does not have to manually select an account  every time the control account is affected.</li>
</ul>
