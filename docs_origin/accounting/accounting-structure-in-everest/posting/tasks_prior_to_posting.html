<p>You are advised to carry out the following tasks prior to posting journals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Review 
 transactions prior to posting</strong> - All transactions should be reviewed  before posting, and all journals must be balanced.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  <strong>Everest</strong>  checks whether the accounts used are valid or not. You must confirm whether  they are they are the right accounts by reviewing the journal.</p>

<p>You can print to paper or a file to help  with your review process.</p>

<p>It is easy to locate and correct mistakes  at this stage. Only manual journals, and payment and receipt journals  can however, be directly modified/deleted before posting. You can adjust  system-generated transactions only by creating new documents or miscellaneous  journal entries.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Print 
 journals prior to posting</strong> - Even though the general ledger reflects  the effect of new transactions that are posted, it is preferable to print  a final version of each journal before posting. This will be an excellent  source of audit trail and will also act as a backup.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/note.gif" alt="" />  <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to set a preference to <strong>Allow 
 user to post a journal even if it is not printed</strong> in <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong>). If this preference is not selected, a journal that  has not been printed cannot be posted.</p>

<p>By default, this option is selected so that  you can post the journal without printing it. It is recommended that journals  be reviewed before posting.</p>
