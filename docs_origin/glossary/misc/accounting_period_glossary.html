    <p><strong>Accounting Period</strong></p>

<p>The business world breaks time into periods to fit their mode of operations. Each time period is called an accounting period. Most companies follow the standard calendar year with 12 periods (months), although some use four quarterly periods. The duration of an accounting period depends on the requirements of your business.</p>
