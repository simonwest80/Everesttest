    <p><strong>Client Server</strong></p>

<p>An arrangement used on local area networks that splits the processing  of an application between two distinct components, the ‘front end’  client and the ‘back end’  server. The end user application runs directly on the client machine transferring  only the required data to the server. This arrangement reduces network  traffic, improves performance, and reduces vulnerability to data corruption.</p>
