<p>Abnormal loss is the excess of required output over actual output.</p>

<p>An Abnormal gain is an unexpected surplus of output if the actual loss  is less than anticipated.</p>

<p>Abnormal loss/gain is calculated by the following formula:</p>

<p>(Estimated input for actual output - Actual input) * Actual rate</p>

<p>If this is negative, then it is a loss, if positive, it is a gain.</p>
