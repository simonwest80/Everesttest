<p>The following back end processes occur when an item is built:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The rate per  unit is calculated for the finished item and the defective units using  the following formula:</li>
</ul>

<p>: Actual Cost of Finished Item = (Actual  Cost of the Assembly Item - Cost of Scrap or By Product)/Required Output</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accounting  entries are generated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If the assembly  item is a serialized or auto-serialized item, serial numbers are automatically  generated for all the assembly items, good and defective.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">To view the serial numbers generated for the items built from the work  order, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Show</strong> <strong>All

<p>You can also assign lot numbers to the items built, if the lot preferences  are selected. Lot numbers are generated for both the good units and defective  units assembled.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The built assembly  items are transferred to the default stock area for assembled/built items.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The “On  Order” stock of the assembly item decreases by the quantity entered  in the <strong>Required Output</strong> field of  the <strong>Work Order</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Bill 
 of Material</strong> &gt; <strong>Work Order</strong> &gt;  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt;  <strong>Work Order</strong> profile).</li>
  <li>The ‘On Reserve’  column in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/misc/the_item_stock_status_dialog_box.html"><strong>Item Stock Status</strong> dialog box</a> decreases  by the standard input and the ‘On Reserve Commit’  column decreases by the quantity committed on the built work order (for  the component items).</li>
