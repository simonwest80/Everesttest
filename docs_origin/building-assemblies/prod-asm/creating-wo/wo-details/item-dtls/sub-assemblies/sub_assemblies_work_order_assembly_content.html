<p>You can also add an item of type assembly to the work order. Thus, an  assembly can have sub-assemblies.</p>

<p>When another assembly item is added to the work order, only the assembled  item is added to the work order. The components of the assembly item added  are NOT retrieved into the work order. Thus, to add an assembly item you  must use another work order.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  assemble Multimedia systems that include speakers, which are also assembled  by you. If you create a work order for multimedia systems, it will not  automatically trigger further work orders for producing speakers. You  must create a work order separately for the speakers.</p>
