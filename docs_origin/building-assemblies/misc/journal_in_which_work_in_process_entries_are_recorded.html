<p>The accounting entries when a work order’s status changes to ‘In Process’  are recorded in an <strong>open</strong> general  journal that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the journal group selected in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Workstation</strong><strong>Settings &gt; Company Settings</strong> tab)  of the user changing the work order’s status to “In Process”.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location as the logged in location or sub-location  of the user changing the work order status to ‘In Process’.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the description “Work In Process”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such <strong>open</strong> journal exists,  a new general journal is created. The general journal number for the new  journal is taken from the sequence number specified for general journals  in the logged in location or sub-location.</p>

<p>If the location does not have sequence numbers assigned, the sequence  numbers specified for the default location is used. The default location  is mentioned in the <strong>Accounting</strong>  dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Default Location</strong> field).</p>
