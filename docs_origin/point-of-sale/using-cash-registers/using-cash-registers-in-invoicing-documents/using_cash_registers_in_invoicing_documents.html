<h1 id="using-cash-registers-in-regular-sales-documents">Using Cash Registers in regular Sales Documents</h1>

<p>You can set up cash registers to use while making collections and refunds  on regular sales documents. Using cash registers enables user accountability  for collections and refunds.</p>

<p class="example">If you want to  track the cashier responsible for non-POS collections from customers,  you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new  cash register.</li>
  <li>Associate the  cashier with the cash register.</li>
  <li>Specify this  cash register as <strong>User Based</strong> in  your Document Flow Control preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cash register to be used on invoicing documents is specified in  the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/flow-ctrl/ctrl/opt/misc/miscellaneous_document_payments_step_by_step_business_process_in_everest.html"><strong>Documents</strong> dialog box</a> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow 
 Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document payments</strong> tab  &gt; <strong>Registers</strong> section).</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Cash register to use while making collection/refund  on regular sales document</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field allows you to select the preference for  using cash registers to account for collections and refunds against non-Point  of Sale sales documents. The options selected affect cash register selection  in <strong>Receipt</strong>, <strong>Refund</strong>  and <strong>Collection</strong> dialog boxes.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">If you attach a cash register to a sales invoice,  any amount collected on that invoice will get updated in the cash register.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Option</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>None</strong></td>
      <td>Does not select any cash register for the document amount. The <strong>Cash Register</strong> field in the <strong>Receipt</strong>,  <strong>Refund</strong> and <strong>Collection</strong>  dialog boxes is disabled.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>User-based</strong></td>
      <td>The <strong>Cash Register</strong> field in the  <strong>Receipt</strong>, <strong>Refund</strong>  and <strong>Collection</strong> dialog boxes uses  the register that is set up in the <strong>User</strong>  profile for the logged in user.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default</td>
      <td>The <strong>Cash Register</strong> field in the  <strong>Receipt</strong>, <strong>Refund</strong>  and <strong>Collection</strong> dialog boxes uses  the register that is set up in the <strong>Default <br /> Cash Register</strong> option in your document default preferences.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Other</td>
      <td>The <strong>Cash Register</strong> field in the  <strong>Receipt</strong>, <strong>Refund</strong>  and <strong>Collection</strong> dialog boxes allows  you to select from the available cash registers.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="note">The cash registers, which are available and displayed in the drop-down,  are based on the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the logged in user is assigned a cash register,  then that cash register will be available for selection in the drop-down.</li>
  <li>If the logged in user is not assigned any cash  registers, then the list of cash registers attached to the user’s location/sub-location  and all cash registers that are not assigned to any location/sub-location  will be displayed.</li>
  <li>If the user is not assigned to any location/sub-location  then the list of cash registers available for the login location/sub-location  and all other cash registers that are not assigned to any location/sub-location  will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Default Cash Register</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field allows you to define the default cash  register to account for collections and refunds from the non-Point of  Sale sales documents.</dd>
  <dd>If you select the option <strong>Default</strong>  from the <strong>Cash register to use while making 
 collection/refund on regular sales document</strong> field and define a  cash register, it is automatically used to transfer payments on invoicing  documents.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">You select <strong>Default</strong>  in the <strong>Cash register to use while making 
 collection/refund on regular sales document</strong> option, define “Cash  Register 1” in the <strong>Default Cash Register</strong>  field and create a sales order on which you receive a deposit from your  customer, the deposit is automatically associated with Cash Register 1.</p>
