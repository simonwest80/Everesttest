<p>You can toggle between a <strong>** **Point of Sale</strong> <strong>** (sales invoice) document and a **Point of Sale</strong> (credit memo) document by selecting the option <strong>Switch to Sales Credit</strong>. A <strong>Point of Sale</strong> (credit memo) document is used to return goods to a customer during a Point of Sale transaction. However, you cannot select this option, if you have already added an item to the <strong>Point of Sale</strong> (sales invoice) document.</p>
