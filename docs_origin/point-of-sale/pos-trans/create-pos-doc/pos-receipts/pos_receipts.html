<p>When you save the Point of Sale (sales invoice) document, the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/the_payment_details_dialog_box_pos_receipts.html"><strong>Payment Details</strong> dialog box</a> is automatically  displayed. You can account for payment through more than one type of tender  in this dialog box.</p>

<p>You CANNOT receive <strong>partial payments</strong>  from Point of Sale customers (POS_CUST). You can save the Point of Sale  document only after you receive full payment from such customers.</p>

<p>However, if you select any other customer in the <strong>Customer</strong>  field, you can receive partial payments and even make a credit sale. When  you receive a partial amount from the customer, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you that there is a balance to be received on the document. You  can take any of the two actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Let 
 me apply additional payments</strong> - If you select this option, you will  return to the <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Details</strong>  dialog box. This option ensures that you receive full payment from your  customer; you cannot collect partial payments.</li>
  <li><strong>Forward 
 the balance of &lt; &gt; to the customer’s account with payment terms</strong>  - If you select this option, the balance amount receivable from the customer  is transferred to the customer’s account. The default payment term for  the customer is retrieved from the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile (path: I<strong>nvoicing &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment Information</strong>  tab). You can modify the payment term.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a customer makes an overpayment at a POS terminal, <strong>Everest</strong>  displays the <strong>Over Payment</strong> dialog  box. The following options are available in the dialog box:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Give 
 the Customer &lt;  &gt; 
 Change</strong> - This option allows you to return the change due to the  customer. When you click <strong>OK</strong>, the  change due is displayed after the POS processing is complete.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If your preferences are set to print receipts (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Others</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Others 1</strong> tab - <strong>Auto-print 
 invoice in point of sale document</strong> selected), the receipt prints  before the change due is displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apply 
 the overpayment as a customer deposit</strong> - This option allows you  to apply the overpayment as a customer deposit. <strong>Everest</strong>  credits the Customer Deposit Account specified in your <strong>Accounting 
 Defaults</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt;  <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Control Accounts</strong> tab) with  the amount of overpayment. The POS internal report displays this amount  as a credit to the customer.</li>
</ul>
