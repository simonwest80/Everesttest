  <dt><strong>Currency</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field is used to specify the currency in which  you are receiving the payment. The customer’s currency is displayed by  default in this field.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">The columns <strong>Pay Rate</strong> and <strong>Currency</strong> are displayed only when you  select the preference option <strong>Allow split 
 payments in multiple currencies</strong> in the <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab of the <strong>Cash Register</strong> profile  - <strong>Payment Type</strong> tab.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is the amount of payment that you still have  to receive from the customer. The amount shown here is the amount in payment  currency if the preference option <strong>Allow 
 split payments in multiple currencies</strong> in the <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab of the <strong>Cash Register</strong> profile  - <strong>Payment Type</strong> tab is checked.  If unchecked, the amount is in document currency.</dd>
  <dd>If the payment currency is changed in the <strong>Currency</strong> column of the Payment grid,  the <strong>Amount</strong> column displays the  equivalent value in the selected currency as per the exchange rate defined.</dd>
  <dd>When a customer makes an overpayment, you can specify  that amount here. The change due to the customer is shown in the <strong>Change In</strong> field in the document’s currency.  <strong>Everest</strong> displays the <strong>Overpayment</strong> dialog box  as you click <strong>OK</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>This dialog box has two options:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Give 
 the Customer &lt;  &gt; 
 Change</strong> - This option allows you to return the change due to the  customer. When you click <strong>OK</strong>, the  change due is displayed after the POS processing is complete.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If your preferences are set to print receipts (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Others</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Others 1</strong> tab - <strong>Auto-print 
 invoice in point of sale document</strong> selected), the receipt prints  before the change due is displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apply 
 the overpayment as a customer deposit</strong> - This option allows you  to apply the overpayment as a customer deposit. <strong>Everest</strong>  credits the Customer Deposit Account specified in your <strong>Accounting 
 Defaults</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt;  <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Control Accounts</strong> tab) with  the amount of overpayment. The POS internal report displays this amount  as a credit to the customer.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The following reports display the overpayment applied as customer deposit  and change due to the customer separately:</p>

<ul>
  <li>POS Internal Report</li>
  <li>POS Receipt 1 (Sales  Invoice)</li>
  <li>POS Receipt 1 (Sales  Invoice-Dot matrix)</li>

      <dd>When you save the Point of Sale (sales invoice)  document, the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/the_payment_details_dialog_box_pos_receipts.html"><strong>Payment Details</strong> dialog box</a> is automatically  displayed. You can account for payment through more than one type of tender  in this dialog box.</dd>
      <dd>You CANNOT receive <strong>partial 
 payments</strong> from Point of Sale customers (POS_CUST). You can save  the Point of Sale document only after you receive full payment from such  customers.</dd>
      <dd>However, if any other customer is selected in the  <strong>Customer</strong> field, you can receive  partial payments and even make a credit sale. When you receive a partial  amount from the customer, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you that there is a balance to be received on the document. You  can take any of the two actions:</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Let 
 me apply additional payments</strong> - If you select this option, you will  return to the <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Details</strong>  dialog box. This option ensures that you receive full payment from your  customer. You cannot collect partial payment from your customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Forward 
 balance of &lt; &gt; to the customer’s account with payment terms</strong>  - If you select this option, the balance amount receivable from the customer  is transferred to the customer’s account. The default payment term for  the customer is retrieved from the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment Information</strong>  tab). You can modify the payment term. Click <strong>OK</strong>  to receive the payment from the customer.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>If the customer is put on credit hold, **Everest</strong> prompts you of the same and  asks if you would like to proceed.**</p>

<p><strong>If the credit limit of the customer has exceeded,  another prompt informs you of that. You are asked if you would still like  to complete the transaction.</strong></p>
