<p>You can receive payments using a gift card from the Point  of Sale profile.</p>

<p class="note">A license is required to process gift cards.  Since a Gift Card license is not a user-based license, only one license  is needed for the entire company. The Gift Card feature is available in  the Sample Company and in evaluation mode.</p>
