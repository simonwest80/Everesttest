<h1 id="point-of-sale-refunds">Point of Sale Refunds</h1>

<p>When you save the <strong>Point of Sale</strong><strong>(credit memo)</strong> profile, the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/the_payment_details_dialog_box_pos_receipts.html"><strong>Payment 
 Details</strong> dialog box</a> is automatically displayed. You can account  for refunds through more than one type of tender in this dialog box.</p>

<p>You CANNOT make partial refunds to default Point of Sale customers (POS_CUST).  You can save the Point of Sale document only after you make full payment.</p>

<p>However, if any other customer is selected in the <strong>Customer</strong> field, you can make partial payments and even make a credit return.  <strong>Everest</strong> prompts you that there  is a balance to be refunded on the document. You can take either of the  following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Apply 
 additional payments</strong> - If you select this option, you will return  to the <strong>Payment Details</strong> dialog  box. This option ensures that you refund full payment to your customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Forward 
 the balance amount to the customer’s account with the payment terms</strong>  - If you select this option, the balance amount payable to the customer  is transferred to the customer’s account. The default payment term for  the customer is retrieved from the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment Information</strong>  tab). You can modify the payment term.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to refund the payment  to the customer.</p>
