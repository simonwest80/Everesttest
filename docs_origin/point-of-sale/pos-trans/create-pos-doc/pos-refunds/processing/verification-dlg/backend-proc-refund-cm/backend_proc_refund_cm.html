<p>The following back-end processes occur when a refund is made against  a Point of Sale (credit memo):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer’s  unposted amount  as seen in the <strong>Customer</strong> profile  increases by the amount of refund. The amount receivable from the customer  increases. When the receipt journal for the payment is posted, the unposted  amount decreases and the posted amount increases with the amount receivable  from the customer staying the same.</li>
  <li>The amount  paid on the Point of Sale (credit memo) document increases. If the amount  paid is applied to a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document, the paid  amount on these documents increases.</li>
  <li>The total balance  of the Point of Sale (credit memo) document reduces. If the amount paid  is applied to a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document, the balance on  these documents decreases by the amount applied.</li>
</ul>
