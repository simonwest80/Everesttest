<dl>
  <dt><strong>Card Number and Expiration</strong></dt>
  <dd>The default card number specified in the <strong>Customer</strong>’s  profile is displayed in this field.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">If the customer’s card is swiped, the card number, its  expiry date and the cardholder’s name appear by default in the <strong>Card 
 Verification</strong> dialog box. If the card is not swiped using a swipe  machine, you must enter these details manually in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/the_payment_details_dialog_box_pos_receipts.html"><strong>Payment Details</strong> dialog box</a>.</p>

<p>When you process a credit card payment through a Point  of Sale (credit memo) document, <strong>Everest</strong>  keeps a history of the credit cards used and related information making  it easier for accessing the cards during repeated refunds.</p>

<p>The cards used by a particular customer can be viewed  from the <strong>Customer</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customers &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>) by clicking the lookup button beside  the <strong>Default Credit Card Number</strong>  field.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Card Holder</strong></dt>
  <dd>The cardholder’s name is automatically displayed  when the card is swiped using a swipe machine or if an existing card number  is selected. If you enter the credit card number manually in the <strong>Payment Details</strong> dialog box, you have  to enter this information manually.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Address and Zip</strong></dt>
  <dd>These fields display the billing address for the  credit card. When you process a credit card refund to a customer and a  new card number is entered or the credit card is swiped, then the billing  address of the customer will be displayed in this field by default.</dd>
  <dd>If a credit card number which already exists is  entered, the address specified in the <strong>Credit 
 Card</strong> profile (path: <strong>Customer</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Payment Information</strong>  tab) is displayed by default in these fields. If no address is specified  in the <strong>Credit Card</strong> profile, the  billing address of the customer is displayed. This address may be modified.</dd>
  <dd>When the refund is processed, the card details are  saved and updated for that credit card in <strong>Everest</strong>.</dd>
