<p>You can toggle between a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document and a Point of Sale (credit memo) document by selecting the option <strong>Switch to Sales Credit</strong>. A Point of Sale (credit memo) document is used to return goods to a customer during a Point of Sale transaction. However, you cannot select this option, if you have already added an item to the Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.</p>
