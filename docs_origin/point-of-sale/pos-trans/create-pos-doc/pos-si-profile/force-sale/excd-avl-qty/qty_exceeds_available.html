<p>Default Stock Area</p>

<p>During the sales process, while committing  quantities,  the default stock area is determined by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a default  stock area for sales orders is specified in the <strong>Assign 
 inventory from &gt; Sales Order</strong> field of the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> of the user committing the quantities (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; WorkStation 
 Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab), the quantities are  assigned to this stock area.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock areas are defined in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong>, the items are assigned to the stock area defined for  sales orders in the login location or the parent location of the login  sub-location (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New 
 Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Sales Document</strong> tab). If no stock  area is defined in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile, the stock area defined for the default location is used.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock areas for sales orders are defined in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> or in the stock transfer preferences for the logged in  location as above, the default stock area defined for <strong>Purchase 
 Receipts/Invoices</strong> in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> of the user committing the quantities is used (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; WorkStation 
 Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Purchase</strong> tab).</li>
  <li>If no default  stock areas for sales orders or purchase receipts/invoices are defined  in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> or in  the stock transfer preferences for the logged in location the items are  assigned to the stock area defined in the <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Receipt/Invoice</strong> field of the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Purchase Document</strong>  tab). If no stock area is defined for login location or the parent location  of the login sub-location, the stock area defined for the default location  is used.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If the option <strong>Allow users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in Location</strong> in the <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General</strong>  tab) is selected, only those stock areas that belong to the logged in  location will be displayed.</p>
