Further, after making payment in a particular currency, you  can view the amount of change due in another currency. The <strong>Balance 
 In</strong> or <strong>Change In</strong> fields  are displayed if the above option is selected.</dd>
  <dd>If the payment amount is less than or equal to the  document total, you will see the <strong>Balance

This option allows you to specify  the default payment method to be used for change due to the customer.  Only cash type of payment methods are available for selection.</dd>
  <dd>You can also specify the default payment method  to be used for change due to customers in the Accounting dialog box (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab) and in the <strong>Others</strong> tabs of  the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> profile  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Workstation</strong><strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>  tab).</dd>
