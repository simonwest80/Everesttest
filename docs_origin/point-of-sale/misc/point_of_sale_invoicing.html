<p>The Point of Sale invoicing system has been designed for touch screen  compatibility. The user interface has been designed to facilitate the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Speed of operations.</li>
  <li>Minimal orientation  - The employees manning Point of Sale counters are often part timers or  temporary personnel. Hence, the invoice screen is as user-friendly and  simple as possible.</li>
  <li>Minimization  of mistakes and errors, especially while handling of cash.</li>
</ul>
