<p>Select the <strong>Document Override</strong>  option if you want to set the type of tax calculation to <strong>Special 
 Tax Rule</strong> automatically, based on the Location or the Tax Jurisdiction;  taxes for individual items are not considered, and taxes applicable for  the selected tax code will only be applied for the whole document. The  tax calculation type can be set to <strong>Special 
 Tax Rule</strong> by clicking the options (path: <strong>Point 
 of Sale</strong> document (Sales document) &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Document</strong> &gt;<strong>Document 
 Override</strong>) or (<strong>Point of Sale</strong>  document (Sales document) &gt; <strong>Tax</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/pos_group_by_tax.gif" alt="" /> icon in the <strong>status</strong>  bar).</p>

<p class="note">: You cannot manually override the tax calculation  type in <strong>Point of Sale</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Tax</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/pos_group_by_tax.gif" alt="" /> icon  performs as an indicator of the tax calculation type applied to the <strong>POS</strong> document. Also enables you to toggle  between the following two tax calculation types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Special 
 Tax rule</strong> defined for the login  jurisdiction or for the location of the shipping address which is set  up by the system automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Special 
 Tax Rule Override</strong> which recalculates the taxes for <strong>Point 
 of sale</strong> based on your tax setup.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">: The tax calculation type can be internally set to  <strong>Special Tax Rule Override</strong> clicking  the <strong>Document Override</strong> option or  <strong>Tax</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/pos_group_by_tax.gif" alt="" />  icon.</p>
