<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field in a <strong>Point of Sale (sales invoice)</strong> profile  displays the location or the sub-location to which the document belongs.  When a <strong>Point of Sale (sales invoice)</strong>  profile is created, the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong>  field displays the login location/sub-location.</p>

<p class="note">When you assign a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of the Point of Sale documents by sub-location and  print reports for management information purposes.</p>

<p class="example">You can generate a report of all the Point of Sale (sales  invoice) documents raised by the Cash Counter Number 1 to review the sales  from that counter.</p>

<p>The document’s location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Sub-Locations do not have separate  sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected, the  address and logo of the sub-location’s location is used.</p>
