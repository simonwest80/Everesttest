<p>Select this check box so as not to apply the discount specified in the  <strong>Discount</strong> field to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An item that already  has a discount specified.</li>
  <li>A line item whose  price is less than the price specified in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt;  <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If the price of a line item is less than the  price specified in the <strong>Item</strong> profile,  global discount is still applied even if this check box is selected. It  is excluded only if the price is changed manually.</p>
