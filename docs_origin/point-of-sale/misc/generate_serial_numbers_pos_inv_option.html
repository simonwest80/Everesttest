<p>You can generate serial numbers (path: <strong>Point 
 of Sale</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Attach/Retrieve Serial #</strong> &gt; <strong>Generate Serial #</strong>) for items that you  want to bring into your stock from a Point of Sale document.</p>

<p>This feature is useful in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have recently migrated to <strong>Everest</strong>,  and received returns from customers for items that were sold before switching  over to <strong>Everest</strong>. The serial numbers  pertaining to such items will not exist in <strong>Everest</strong>.  In order to facilitate tracking of such items, you can use the <strong>Generate 
 Serial #</strong> option.</li>
  <li>If you want to account  for the service or return of serialized items that you have not sold but  want to track. You can use this option to track the item returned and  bring it back into stock, and then assign the manufacturer’s serial number  if any.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> You are an authorized  service center of a computer vendor. Customers can come into your center  to service items that they have bought in any other store or they can  even return defectives. You then return this item to the computer vendor.  In such a case, when a customer comes in with an item for repairs or return  (the serial number of which you want to track), you can use this option  to generate a new serial number. You can the assign the manufacturer’s  serial number and bring the item into stock by creating a credit memo.</p>

<p class="steps">To generate a serial number from a point  of sale profile, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Point of Sale</strong> profile, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Attach</strong>/<strong>Retrieve</strong> <strong>Serial</strong><strong>#</strong> &gt; <strong>Generate</strong><strong>Serial #</strong>.</li>
  <li>Enter the number  of serial numbers to be generated in the <strong>Generate</strong><strong>Quantity</strong> column of the <strong>Generate 
 Serial #</strong> dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The quantity entered should NOT exceed the quantity  specified in the <strong>Quantity</strong> column  of the Item Details Grid.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Press the <strong>Enter</strong> key. The required quantity gets  displayed in the Items Details Grid of the <strong>Point 
 of Sale</strong> profile.</li>
</ul>
