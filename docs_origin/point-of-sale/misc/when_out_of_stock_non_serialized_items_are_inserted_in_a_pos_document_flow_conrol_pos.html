<p><strong>Everest</strong> is equipped to handle  the following situations in POS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the quantity  of a non-serialized item brought to the cash counter exceeds the quantity  available.</li>
  <li>When the item  belongs to a third party and is sold under an arrangement with the third  party.</li>
</ul>

<p>In such cases, you can decide how to treat non-serialized items that  are out of stock. The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>None</strong>  - This option does not allow you to either attach items from a different  stock area or to add quantity. The non-availability of stock is conveyed  through a message.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust 
 Inventory -</strong> This option brings up the <strong>Quantity 
 Adjustment</strong> and the <strong>Attach Quantity</strong>  dialog boxes that allow you to adjust inventory by adding quantity of  items to stock.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Force 
 Sale</strong></li>
  <li>If there is no stock,  this option allows the sales representative to enter non-serialized items  to a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.</li>
  <li>If there is partial  stock, the <strong>Force Sale Options</strong>  dialog box appears when you enter non-serialized items in a Point of Sale  (sale invoice) document. You can reduce the quantity to match available  quantity, change the unavailable quantity to a force sale or add quantity.</li>
</ul>
