<h1 id="delivery-date">Delivery Date</h1>

<p>The <strong>Delivery Date</strong> field in a  sales quote or a sales order allows you to specify the date of expected  delivery of the shipment to the customer’s address. When a document is  created, by default the <strong>Delivery Date</strong>  field displays the current system date. If required, you can modify the  delivery date.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana"> </font>The  delivery date on orders helps plan management of inventories.</p>

<p>The delivery date on a sales invoice identifies the date on which the  items were actually shipped, as there could be a time lag between the  date on which the items were issued and the date on which the sales invoice  was created.</p>

<p>When you convert a sales quote to a sales order or a sales order to  a sales invoice, the following will occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The converted  sales order displays the login  date, if the delivery date on the sales quote is blank.</li>
  <li>The converted  sales order displays the date specified on the sales quote, if a delivery  date has been specified in the sales quote.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>**Everest</strong>  displays a message if line items in the document have a due date different  from the document’s delivery date, and retains the due dates of the line  items.**</p>

<p><strong>The date of delivery can be prior to the document’s  date.</strong></p>
