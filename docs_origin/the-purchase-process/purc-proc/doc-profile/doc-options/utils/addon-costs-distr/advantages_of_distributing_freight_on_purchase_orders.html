<p>The following are the advantages of distributing add-on costs on purchase  orders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A vendor may  include a single item for add-on costs or add it to all items in the purchase  order but may deliver the items in more than one shipment. As a purchase  receipt or invoice has to be created for every shipment received, you  may have to manually compute the add-on costs for each shipment and distribute  it on each purchase receipt/invoice. By distributing the add-on costs  on the purchase order, you can ensure that the correct add-on costs are  carried over to each purchase receipt/invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">You create a purchase order which has add-on  costs of $150 and distribute the add-on costs based on the items’ value  of $1500. The first shipment received is for $1000. When you process the  receipt, $100 of the total add-on costs is allocated to the items in the  receipt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The order value  reflects the true cost of the order.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The add-on costs distributed increases the value of  the document and also the amount payable to the vendor. Hence, you can  use this utility only if the vendor is billing you for the freight on  the same document and not if you pay the add-on costs directly.</p>
