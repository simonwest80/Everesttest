<p>Companies often apply discounts to entire purchase documents  based upon the relationships they have with various vendors. The <strong>Document Discount</strong> option can be used  to quickly apply a global discount on all line items in the document (path:  Purchase Document profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Document</strong> &gt; <strong>Document 
 Discount</strong>).</p>

<p>For example, you can quickly add an 8% discount to all line  items in the purchase order using this option. It is not necessary to  add the discount manually to each line item.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Discount</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use this option to specify a discount percentage  to be applied to all line items in the document.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Exclude already reduced items</strong></dt>
  <dd>If you select this check box, the discount specified  in the <strong>Discount</strong> field is not applicable  to items that already have a discount specified.</dd>
