<p>Foreign currency documents are purchase documents that are created for  a foreign currency vendor (a vendor who invoices you in a currency other  than your base currency).</p>

<p>In a foreign currency document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The currency of  the document is the same as the vendor’s currency.</li>
  <li>The current exchange  rate for the currency is displayed; this can be edited for the document.</li>
  <li>The document can  be viewed either in the document’s currency or the base currency.</li>
  <li>The document amounts  can be entered in either the base currency or the document currency. When  switching to the other currency, then the amounts are translated using  the exchange rate defined in the document.</li>
</ul>
