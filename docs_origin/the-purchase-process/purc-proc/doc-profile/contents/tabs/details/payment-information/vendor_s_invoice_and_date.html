<h1 id="vendors-invoice-no-and-date">Vendor’s Invoice No. and Date</h1>

<p>The <strong>Vendor’s Invoice No.</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> fields allow you to enter additional  invoice reference information provided by the vendor such as the vendor’s  invoice number and date. This helps track the purchase receipt to the  copy of the vendor’s bill.</p>

<p>The date of vendor’s invoice is used to compute the due date for payment  on the document, if the <strong>Specified days 
 from invoice</strong> option is selected (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Terms &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; 
 In New Window</strong>) for the document’s payment term.</p>

<p>When you specify an invoice number, this date defaults to the login  date. It is mandatory to enter a date in this field in a purchase receipt.</p>

<p class="note">If you enter an invoice number that already  exists, you are warned with a message to that effect. However, you can  choose to enter the same number.</p>
