<p>Use this field to specify the date on which you expect to pay the vendor.  This field defaults from the <strong>Due Date 
 Information</strong> specified in the <strong>Payment 
 Terms</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Payment Terms</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p>To specify another due date, check the <strong>Override</strong>  option which enables the <strong>Due date</strong>  field for editing and disables the <strong>Terms</strong>  field.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <strong>Vendor’s 
 Invoice #</strong> and <strong>Date</strong> are  entered and the <strong>Terms from purchase invoice 
 date</strong> check box is NOT checked, the <strong>Due 
 date</strong> is calculated based on the vendor’s invoice date.</li>
  <li>However, if the  option is checked, the purchase invoice date takes precedence over the  specified vendor invoice date.</li>
  <li>If both the <strong>Vendor’s Invoice Date</strong> and <strong>Terms</strong><strong>from purchase invoice date</strong> are  cleared, the <strong>Due date</strong> for payment  calculates based on the Purchase Invoice date.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>You can modify this field even after saving  the purchase document and posting the journal entries.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you select the **Terms 
 from purchase invoice</strong> date check box, the due date cannot be earlier  than the document date.**</p>

<p><strong>If you do NOT select this check box, the due  date cannot be earlier than the vendor’s invoice date.</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Override</strong></dt>
  <dd>This check box allows you to override the due date  computed based on the document’s payment term, and specify the last date  of payment manually in the <strong>Due Date</strong>  field. If this check box is not selected the <strong>Due 
 Date</strong> option is disabled.</dd>
