<h1 id="journal-transaction-information">Journal Transaction Information</h1>

<p>The <strong>Transactions</strong> tab displays  the accounting entry that was created in the system when the purchase  receipt or invoice was saved. The tab displays details such as the accounts  that are debited or credited, amount of debit/credit, the purchase journal  and transaction number in which the entry was recorded, the document number  and date, and the source of the transaction.</p>

<p>The <strong>Entry Type</strong> column provides  additional information regarding the accounting entry. This column is  also available in the journal transaction browser.</p>

<p class="example">The ACP account can have an entry type of  “Accrued Purchase” or “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”.  If a PPV account arises due to a price change, it does not have an entry  type. If a PPV account arises to offset an accrued purchases adjustment  (the ACP adjustment offsets an imbalance in the ACP account), it displays  the entry type “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”.</p>

<p class="note">This tab is displayed only on a saved purchase  receipt or invoice.</p>

<p>You can view the amounts in base currency or the vendor’s currency.  To view the amounts in base currency, select the option <strong>View 
 in Base Currency</strong> from the right-click menu. This is a toggle option.</p>
