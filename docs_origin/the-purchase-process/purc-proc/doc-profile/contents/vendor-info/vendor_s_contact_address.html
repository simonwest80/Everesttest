<p>The <strong>Contact</strong> field displays the  address of the person who is to be contacted for matters relating to the  purchase document.</p>

<p><strong>When you select the vendor code, the default  contact address specified in the **Vendor</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Purchasing</strong> &gt;  <strong>Vendors</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Address</strong>  tab), is displayed in the purchase document profile.**</p>

<p><strong>If a default address is not defined in  the **Vendor</strong> profile, this field  will be blank. You can change the contact address.**</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Everest</strong>  also allows you to select a billing, contact, shipping or return address  of any other vendor or customer from the <strong>Addresses</strong>  browser. This feature is useful in case the vendor has group companies.  You can select a customer’s contact address if the vendor is also your  customer.</p>
