<h1 id="locationsub-location">Location/Sub-Location</h1>

<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field in a purchase  document displays the location or sub-location to which the document belongs.  This field defaults to the login location/sub-location when a new quote,  order, receipt, or invoice is created. You can change the location or  sub-location.</p>

<p>This field helps you to keep track of purchase documents by location/sub-location  and print reports required for management information purposes.</p>

<p class="example">You  can generate a report of all purchase quotes raised from the retail department  to review the purchase requirements of the location/sub-location.</p>

<p>Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers</p>

<p>The location or sub-location details are  required to print your address and logo on the document. Since location/sub-locations  do not have separate sequence numbers, addresses and logos, if a location/sub-location  is selected, the sub-location’s location details are used.</p>

<p>Processed Documents</p>

<p>As documents are converted from one type to another (quote, order, receipt,  invoice), the location/sub-location specified in the original document  is carried throughout. You can change the location/sub-location before  posting the purchase journal for the purchase invoice.</p>

<p>Different Location/Sub-Location for Vendor and Document</p>

<p>When the location/sub-location assigned to the vendor in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab)  is different from that of the document, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you with a message to that effect, asking you whether you want  to change it. You can choose to change the document’s location/sub-location  by clicking ‘Yes’.</p>

<p class="note">You can set a preference to <strong>Allow 
 users to open only those purchasing documents which belong to his/her 
 default location/sub-location</strong> in the <strong>Documents</strong> dialog box <strong>** (path: **File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Others &gt; Others 2</strong> tab).</p>
