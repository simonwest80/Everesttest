<p>You can edit Line Item details in a saved but unposted <strong>Purchase 
 Invoice</strong> profile. Whenever you modify the editable columns like  Invoiced Quantity, Item Cost, Discount Value, Discount %, Tax Code, and  Add-on Cost for a line item, and it results in a change in the total value  of the line item, the following back-end processes occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New columns are  created that store the original values on the purchase invoice:</li>
  <li>Original Item  Cost</li>
  <li>Original Discount</li>
  <li>Original Tax  Amount</li>
  <li>
    <p>Original Add-on  Cost</p>
  </li>
  <li>The following existing  columns display the last modified cost:</li>
  <li>Item Cost</li>
  <li>Discount value</li>
  <li>Discount %</li>
  <li>Tax Code</li>
  <li>Job Code</li>
  <li>Add-on cost</li>
</ul>

<p>On saving a modified <strong>Purchase 
 Invoice</strong> profile the system checks whether there is a Sales Invoice  created between the Original Date and Time when the purchase invoice was  created and the Date and Time when the purchase invoice was modified and  whether there is a difference in the Original Cost and the Cost mentioned  in the modified purchase invoice.</p>

<p>If system finds out any such records then those  records must be marked with * in the <strong>Sales 
 Commission Report</strong> next to the Cost column.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>Adequate security  right is needed to modify the line item details.</li>
  <li>You cannot edit  the Received column on a saved Purchase Invoice profile.</li>
  <li>Modifying the Add-on  Cost in <strong>Add-on Cost Distribution</strong>  dialog box, it will reflect in Item Details grid.</li>
  <li>If the total value  of the Line Item edited is equal to the value that was there earlier the  system will not generate the <strong>Cost Adjustment</strong>  document.</li>
</ul>
