<p>When you manually create an entry in a purchase journal crediting the  vendor, a manual purchase invoice is created. The document number is prefixed  with an “<strong>M</strong>” to denote it is a  manual purchase invoice.</p>

<p>If the document number is left blank, the sequence number for manual  purchase invoice for the logged in location or sub-location is used (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchasing</strong>  tab).</p>

<p>If this number is not assigned, the sequence number assigned to the  <strong>Default Location</strong> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab) is used.</p>

 Invoices</strong> browser &gt; <strong>View</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>). Manual purchase  invoices have a <strong>PI#</strong> that is prefixed  with “M”.  Manual  documents also display “Accounting” in the <strong>Type</strong>  column.</p>
