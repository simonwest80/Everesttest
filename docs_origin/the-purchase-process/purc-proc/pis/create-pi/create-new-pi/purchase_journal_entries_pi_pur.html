<p>Purchase invoices are recorded in an ‘open’ system purchase journal  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A journal whose  accounting period corresponds to the login date.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same journal group as the one selected in the Workstation Settings  of the user creating the purchase invoice.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location of the  purchase invoice.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same account for Accounts Payable Control as the Accounts Payable  Control account selected in the Accounts Payable field (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Posting Group</strong> profile) of  Vendor Posting Group.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Though accounts get resolved based on the  hierarchical factor, you can change them in the documents like Posting  Accounts Information screen, Document grid, or in the Journal transactions.</p>

<p>If no such ‘open’ journal exists, a new purchase journal is created.  The purchase journal number for the new journal is taken from the sequence  number for purchase journals for the logged in location/sub-location.</p>

<p>If this number is not assigned, the sequence number assigned to the  <strong>Default Location</strong> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab) is used.</p>
