<h1 id="advantages-of-creating-a-purchase-quote">Advantages of Creating a Purchase Quote</h1>

<p>Although you can create a purchase order without creating a purchase  quote, there are certain advantages in creating a quote.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Comparative 
 analysis of vendor quotations</strong> - The purchase quote records vendor  information, product information, terms of the purchase and other details  for each vendor quotation. This allows you to compare and analyze quotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Record 
 vendor negotiations</strong> - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage 
 vendor contacts</strong> - The purchase quote is the basis for negotiations  with the vendor. It helps retrieve the details of the quote during conversations  or contacts with the vendor. The <strong>Everest</strong>  Contact Manager allows you to associate tasks and appointments with a  specified quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimize 
 data entry at the time of creating purchase orders</strong> - When a purchase  quote is converted to an order, the information in the purchase quote  flows into the purchase order thus reducing data entry for order creation.</li>
</ul>
