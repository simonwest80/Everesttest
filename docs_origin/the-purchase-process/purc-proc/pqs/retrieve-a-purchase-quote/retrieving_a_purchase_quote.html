<p>Once a purchase quote has been converted to a purchase order, it can  no longer be viewed in the <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Quotes</strong> browser.</p>

<p>You can however view it by retrieving it. To retrieve a purchase quote,  you must cancel the purchase order. The purchase order then reverts to  the purchase quote and can be viewed from the <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Quotes</strong> browser.</p>
