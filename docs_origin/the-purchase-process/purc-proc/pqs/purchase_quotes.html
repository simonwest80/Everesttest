<h1 id="purchase-quotes">Purchase Quotes</h1>

<p>The purchase quote is the first document generated in the purchase process.  The purchase quote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Records quotation  details received from vendors.</li>
  <li>Helps the purchasing  department evaluate quotes from various vendors and place an order against  the best quote.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the purchase quote flows through the purchase order,  purchase receipt, and purchase invoice. You can directly create a purchase  order, purchase receipt, or purchase invoice without creating a purchase  quote.</p>

<p class="note">The purchase quote is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when a purchase quote is  created.</p>
