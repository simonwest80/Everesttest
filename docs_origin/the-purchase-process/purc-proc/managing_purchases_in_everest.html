<p>You can manage <em>**</em> purchases and  vendor payments in two different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By creating purchase  and purchase return documents, and making payments against them.
    <ul>
      <li>By generating manual  accounting entries for purchases or purchase returns in a purchase journal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The sequence of steps involved in creating purchase documents is called  the purchase process. The following documents are used in the purchase  process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase Quotes</li>
  <li>Purchase Orders</li>
  <li>Purchase Receipts</li>
  <li>Purchase Invoices</li>
</ul>

<p>The sequence of steps involved in returning purchased goods are collectively  called the purchase returns process. The following documents are used  in the purchase return process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Debit Quotes</li>
  <li>Debit Orders</li>
  <li>Debit Memos</li>
</ul>

<p>When tasks related to purchasing or vendor payments are carried out  through purchase documents, <strong>Everest</strong>  automatically generates the accounting entries in a purchase or payment  journal. These journals are called “system journals”.</p>

<p>The journals in which manual entries are made are termed “manual  journals”. Manual entries cannot be made in a system journal. When  a manual journal is created, only the amount payable or due from the vendor  is recorded; details of items purchased or returned are not provided.  Thus, manual purchase journals do not affect inventory.</p>
