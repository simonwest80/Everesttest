<p>You can create recurring purchase documents only for non-inventoried  items.</p>

<p>Create a Recurring Purchase Order</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/pos/create-po/creating_purchase_orders.html">Create  a purchase order</a> for the required vendor.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Recurrence patterns can be set if you add only non-inventoried  items to purchase orders.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define the  <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/recur-pmnts/define-recurrence-pattern/define_a_recurrence_pattern_purchase_orders_purchase_contents.html">Recurrence  Schedule</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you save the recurrence details,  <strong>Everest</strong> creates as many purchase  orders as defined in the recurrence pattern.</p>

<p class="example">If you create a purchase order for maintenance  for a year and the amount is due to be paid every month; <strong>Everest</strong>  creates 12 purchase orders. Tasks (using the <strong>Contact</strong><strong>Manager</strong> function) are also created  automatically with reminders to convert these purchase orders into invoices  on the scheduled dates.</p>

<p>Once the recurring purchase orders are created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have to  be manually converted to purchase invoices on the due date. The <strong>Contact</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>  function gives you a reminder to that effect.</li>
</ul>
