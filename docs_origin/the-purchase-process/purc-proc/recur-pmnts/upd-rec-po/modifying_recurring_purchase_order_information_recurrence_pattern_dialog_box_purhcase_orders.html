<h1 id="modify-recurring-purchase-order-information">Modify Recurring Purchase Order Information</h1>

<p>All information that can be modified in normal purchase orders can also  be modified on recurring purchase orders.</p>

<p>When you modify a recurring purchase order, you can also modify all  future documents in the series.</p>

<p class="example">If you change the item cost on the fifth purchase  order in a series of 12 recurring orders, you can choose to update the  cost change in the 7 remaining orders in the series also.</p>

<p>When you modify the document, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts if you want to similarly modify all subsequent documents in the  series. Click <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>  as required.</p>
