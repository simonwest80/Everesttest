<p>The effectiveness of your purchase function would be reflected in the  prices at which you are able to procure goods and services over a period  of time. Purchase analysis is also required to make purchasing decisions  over a long term. Sales analysis is required to analyze the trends in  sales prices and sales quantities of items.</p>

<p>The <strong>Sales/Purchase Analysis</strong> option  gives an analysis of purchases made in conjunction with sales over selected  time periods. The analysis can be obtained for quantity, price and value.  You can also obtain a summary or detailed analysis. This option is a powerful  analysis tool for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing short term  or long term trends in purchase and sales prices of selected or all items.</li>
  <li>Obtaining a percent  contribution of each item to total purchases in a category in a period.</li>
  <li>Viewing the trend  in sales quantities over a period to plan for future purchases to meet  the sales.</li>
  <li>Obtaining a percent  contribution of each category to total purchases in a period.</li>
