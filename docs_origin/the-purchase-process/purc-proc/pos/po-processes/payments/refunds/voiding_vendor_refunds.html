<p>Vendor refunds are accounted in a payment journal. A payment journal  that is not posted can be voided. A single payment/refund cannot be voided;  the entire journal must be voided. When the journal is voided, all processes  that took place on refund such as increasing the vendor’s balance, updating  payment amount on document and document status are rolled back.</p>
