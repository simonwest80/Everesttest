<p>When you reopen an order, its statuses change from Closed to the following:</p>

<p>Received status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not received -  if the received quantity on the closed order was zero</li>
  <li>Partially received  - if some items on the order were received</li>
  <li>Fully received  - if all of the items on the order were received</li>
</ul>

<p>Invoiced status:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not invoiced -  if the invoiced quantity on the closed order was zero</li>
  <li>Partially invoiced  - if some items on the order were invoiced</li>
  <li>Fully invoiced  - if all of the items on the order were invoiced</li>
</ul>
