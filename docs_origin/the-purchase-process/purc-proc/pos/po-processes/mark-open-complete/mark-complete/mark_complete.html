<p>A purchase order is closed only if all items are both fully received  and fully invoiced, or when you mark it complete. If you mark it complete  before it is fully received and fully invoiced, the system indicates that  they ordered quantity of the line items will be reduced to either the  received or invoiced quantity, whichever is less, and that any committed  quantity will be uncommitted. You may choose <strong>Yes</strong>  to proceed with marking it complete or <strong>No</strong>  to leave the purchase order open.</p>
