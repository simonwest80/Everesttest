<p>If you do not wish to continue the purchase process with your vendor,  then you can cancel the purchase order (path: <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Order</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Process</strong> &gt; <strong>Cancel</strong>).</p>

<p>On doing so, the system converts it to a purchase quote which is available  as a normal system document.</p>

<p>The following purchase orders cannot be canceled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A purchase order  that is a ‘Back Order’.</li>
  <li>A purchase order  on which a deposit has been made.</li>
</ul>
