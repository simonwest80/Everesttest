<p>The accounting entries for collections on a debit order are entered  in an open system <strong>Payment Journal</strong>  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A journal with  the accounting period corresponding to the login date.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> of the user entering the collection/payment.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same location as the logged-in location/sub-location of the user entering  the collection/ payment.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the description ‘Payment Journal’.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same bank account as the one specified for the payment method.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>If no such <strong>open</strong> journal exists,  a new payment journal is created. The number for the new journal is taken  from the sequence numbers specified for **Payment </dt>
  <dt> Journals** in the logged-in location or sub-location.</dt>
