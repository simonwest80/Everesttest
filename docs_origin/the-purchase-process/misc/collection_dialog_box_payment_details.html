<h1 id="collection-dialog-box---payment-details">Collection Dialog Box - Payment Details</h1>

<p>The payment details available in the <strong>Collection</strong>  dialog box are given below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Batch Processing</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option allows you to process pending collections  in a batch, instead of processing the payments for each document individually.  When this check box is selected, the transactions are transferred to the  <strong>Batch Payment Processing - Others</strong>  browser (path: <strong>Accounting &gt; Accounts 
 Payable &gt; Batch Payment Processing</strong>). Accounting entries recording  the payment/refund are created only when these transactions are processed  from the <strong>Batch Payment Processing - Others</strong>  browser.</dd>
  <dt>Refunds are made through credit card on orders  you place with your vendor. Using this option, you can process all refunds  at the end of the day in a batch instead of processing them one by one.</dt>
  <dd>This check box is displayed/hidden depending on  the preference you set for processing payments (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Document payments</strong> tab  &gt; <strong>Batch Payments</strong> section).  You must possess adequate security rights to select this box.</dd>
