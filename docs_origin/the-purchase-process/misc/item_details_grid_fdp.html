<p>Add-on costs are distributed on items in a purchase order for the quantity  ordered,  in  a purchase receipt for the items received, and in a purchase invoice for  items invoiced and items received on invoice.</p>

<p>All inventoried items are displayed in this grid.</p>

<p class="example">In case of purchase orders, the weight of  the quantity ordered in kilograms or the volume of the quantity ordered  in liters <em>**</em> and the value of the  quantity ordered are displayed. In case of purchase receipts, the weight  of the quantity received in kilograms, the volume of the quantity received  in liters and the value of the quantity received is displayed. These weights,  volumes and values are the basis for distribution.</p>

<p>The add-on costs amount is automatically pro-rated to the item based  on the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/distribution_method_aoc_distribution_dialog_pur.html">Distribution  Method</a> selected.</p>

<p class="example">If freight of $100 is distributed on total  weight, and weight of quantities of all items on the order is 100kg, freight  for an item weighing 25kg will be $25.</p>

<p>The add-on costs distributed are added to the value of the items on  the order, receipt, or invoice.</p>

<p>The add-on costs computed are displayed. You  can  modify it in the <strong>Add-on Costs</strong><strong>Distribution</strong> dialog box and not  in the <strong>Add-on Costs</strong> column in  a purchase document profile.</p>
