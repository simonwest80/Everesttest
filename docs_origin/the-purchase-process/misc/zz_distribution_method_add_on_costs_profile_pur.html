<p>: You can allocate costs using any of the following  methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Weight - Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the weight of the items (i.e., items weighing  more take on more of the add-on cost).</li>
  <li>Amount – Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the monetary value of the items (i.e., items  which cost more take on more of the add-on costs).</li>
  <li>Volume - Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the volume of the items (i.e., items in  larger volume take on more of the add-on cost).</li>
  <li>Quantity –  Distribute add-on costs in proportion to the quantity of each item (i.e.,  items purchased in greater quantities take on more of the add-on cost).</li>
  <li>User specified  - Enter the add-on costs manually for each item.</li>
</ul>

<p>: The system distributes the add-on costs across all  of the inventoried items on a purchase document based on the method you  choose. This field is mandatory.</p>
