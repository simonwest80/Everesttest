<h1 id="received-but-not-invoiced-column">Received but not Invoiced Column</h1>

<p>When you convert a purchase order or receipt to a purchase invoice,  this column populates with the quantity in the Received column minus the  quantity in the Invoiced column of the purchase order/receipt at the time  you converted it.</p>

<p>When you create a purchase invoice directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column displays a zero.</p>

<p>You cannot edit this column.</p>
