<p>The <strong>Claimed</strong> option indicates  whether GST/VAT  has been claimed on the document and cannot be edited. When the <strong>Input Claim PI Browser</strong> is saved, <strong>Everest</strong> updates the <strong>Claimed</strong> check box on the purchase invoice and saves the document. The <strong>Claimed</strong> check box will be selected if  you mark the purchase invoice as claimed in the <strong>Input 
 Claim PI Browser</strong>. If the Vendor’s tax invoice date has NOT been  specified, <strong>Everest</strong> updates the  <strong>Tax invoice date</strong> field with the  login date prior to saving the purchase invoice.</p>
