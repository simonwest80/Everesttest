<p>If you return an item, a proportionate amount of discount may be deducted  from the discount originally allowed to you, while receiving the refund.  If you enter the entire amount as a refund, the <strong>Discount 
 call back</strong> field displays the total amount of <strong>Discount 
 applied</strong> on the purchase receipt. If you enter a partial amount,  this field displays a proportionate amount in the <strong>Discount 
 call back</strong> field.</p>

<p>The amount you enter in the <strong>Discount 
 call back</strong> field cannot be greater than the total payment discount  on the document. If you enter a higher amount, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you of the same, and does not allow you to proceed.</p>

<p>The amount of payment discount, as displayed in the <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field of the document profile, is reduced by the total  discount called back.</p>

<p class="note">This field is not enabled for refund on a debit memo.  This field is displayed in a purchase receipt if a payment discount is  received on the document.</p>
