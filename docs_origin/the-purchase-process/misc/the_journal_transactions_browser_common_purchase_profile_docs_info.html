<p>The <strong>Journal</strong> <strong>Transactions</strong>  browser is displayed when you click the Posted/Unposted section (in the  status bar) of the <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Receipt</strong>/<strong>Debit</strong><strong>Memo</strong> profile.</p>

<p>This browser displays the accounting entries created in the system when  the purchase receipt/debit memo is saved. The browser displays details  such as the accounts that are debited or credited, the account entry type,  the amount of debit/credit, the purchase journal and transaction number  in which the entry was recorded, the document number and date and the  source of the transaction.</p>

<p class="example">The ACP account can have an entry type of  “Accrued Purchase” or “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”.  If a PPV account arises due to a price change, it does not have an entry  type. If a PPV account arises to offset an accrued purchases adjustment  (the ACP adjustment offsets an imbalance in the ACP account), it displays  the entry type “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”.</p>

<p>Use the option <strong>View</strong> <strong>in</strong><strong>Base</strong> <strong>Currency</strong>  (path: <strong>Journal</strong> <strong>Transactions</strong>  browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>View</strong> <strong>in</strong><strong>Base</strong> <strong>Currency</strong>)  to view the amounts in base currency. This is a toggle option that also  allows you to view the amounts in the vendor’s currency.</p>
