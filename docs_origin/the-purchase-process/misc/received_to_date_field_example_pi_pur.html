<p class="example">The steps in the following table illustrate  how the <strong>Received to Date</strong> field  changes for a line item when you create a purchase receipt and purchase  invoices from the same purchase order. In this example, the preference  option <strong>Set the quantity received value 
 to zero when converting a purchase order to a purchase invoice</strong>  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow

<p>The <strong>Received to Date</strong> field of  the latest purchase invoice created displays the sum of the Received quantities  entered when creating the purchase receipt and both purchase invoices  from the original purchase order:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Quantity received on 1st PI created:</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quantity received on PR created:</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quantity received on 2nd PI created:</td>
      <td>20</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Total Received to Date</td>
      <td>35</td>
    </tr>

<p>The purchase documents display the quantities shown in the following  table.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Document Created from PO</td>
      <td>Quantity Received</td>
      <td>Received to Date</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1st PI Created</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PR Created</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2nd PI Created</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>35</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Since the <strong>Received to Date</strong> field  is based on the quantity received at the time of creating the invoice,  the <strong>Received to Date</strong> field of  the previous purchase invoice document created (1st PI created) does not  update based on additional quantities received. Likewise, the <strong>Received 
 to Date</strong> field for the second PI created will not update when receiving  additional quantities.</p>
