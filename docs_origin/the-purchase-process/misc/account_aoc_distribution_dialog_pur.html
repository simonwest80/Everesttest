<p>This column displays the GL account of the selected add-on cost ID.  If you did not select a GL account for this add-on cost ID in the Add-on  Cost profile, the column remains blank by default. You may edit the account  for documents with FOB Origin if you have not yet posted the purchase  journal. The change only affects this particular document; future documents  use the original account for the add-on cost ID.</p>

<p>If you add multiple entries for the same add-on cost, you may have different  GL accounts. The add-on costs simply post to the different GL accounts  used.</p>

<p>When working within a purchase document with the FOB Type set to Origin,  you must select a GL account in order to continue. Purchase documents  set to FOB Destination do not need a GL Account because they always use  the Accrued Purchases account. Editing this account requires a separate  security.</p>
