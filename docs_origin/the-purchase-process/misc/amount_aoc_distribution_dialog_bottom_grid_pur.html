<h1 id="amount">Amount</h1>

<p>This column displays the monetary value of the items (excluding line  item discounts) calculated by multiplying the quantity with the Cost after  Discount. The value here is the same as the value displayed in the Amount  column in the purchase document’s items grid before you enter the add-on  costs.</p>

<p>Purchase orders and debit orders consider the quantity in the document’s  Ordered column; purchase receipts and debit memos consider the quantity  in the document’s Received column.</p>

<p>On a purchase invoice, the amount is shown under both the <strong>Received 
 on Invoice</strong> and <strong>Invoiced</strong>  headings.</p>

<p>You cannot edit this column.</p>
