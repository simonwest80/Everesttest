<h1 id="weight">Weight</h1>

<p>The <strong>Weight</strong> column displays the  total weight of each line item. The total weight is computed using the  item quantity entered in the purchase document and the weight per unit  of measure as defined in the <strong>Item</strong> profile  (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Item</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>  &gt; <strong>Purchases</strong> tab - Double-click  the <strong>Freight</strong> field to open the  <strong>Item Freight</strong> dialog box). It is  converted to the weight measure defined for the logged in country and  displayed. Purchase orders and debit orders consider the quantity in the  document’s <strong>Ordered</strong> column; purchase  receipts and debit memos consider the quantity in the document’s <strong>Received</strong> column. You cannot edit this  column.</p>

<p>On a purchase invoice, the weight is shown under both the <strong>Received 
 on Invoice</strong> and <strong>Invoiced</strong>  headings (provided both of these display when the quantities differ).</p>
