<p>The Discontinued Add-on Costs browser displays all add-on costs which  you previously discontinued. You may reactivate any add-on cost by selecting  it in the browser and using the <strong>Activate</strong>  option. The newly activated add-on cost disappears from the Discontinued  Add-on Costs browser and appears in <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/add_on_costs_browser_pur.html">The  Add-on Costs Browser</a>. (If you already have the Add-on Costs browser  open, you must Refresh to see the newly activated Add-on Cost.)</p>
