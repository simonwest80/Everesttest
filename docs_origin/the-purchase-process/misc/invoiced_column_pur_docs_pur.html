<p>Purchase Orders</p>

<p>In the case of an open purchase order, this column has no value.</p>

<p>When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, this column  automatically updates when you enter quantity into the Invoiced column  of the purchase invoice and save the invoice.</p>

<p>You cannot edit this column.</p>

<p>Purchase Receipts</p>

<p>When you convert a purchase order to a purchase receipt, this column  populates with the quantity in the Invoiced column of the purchase order  at the time you converted it.</p>

<p>When you create a purchase receipt directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column displays a zero.</p>

<p>When you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, this column  updates when you save the invoice if you entered a new value in the Invoiced  column of the purchase invoice. The receipt also updates with each invoice  if you convert it to multiple purchase invoices.</p>

<p>You cannot edit this column.</p>

<p>Purchase Invoices</p>

<p>When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, this column  populates with the quantity in the Ordered but not Invoiced column of  the purchase order at the time you converted it. When you convert a purchase  receipt to a purchase invoice, this column automatically populates with  the quantity in the Received but not Invoiced column of the purchase receipt.</p>

<p>You can select the option Set the quantity invoiced value to zero when  converting a purchase order/receipt to a purchase invoice (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Others</strong> &gt; <strong>Others 
 1</strong> tab).</p>

<p>You must save the new invoice before you can edit this column. You can  edit it after subsequent saves; however, you cannot edit this column after  the purchase invoice is posted.</p>

<p>When you create a purchase invoice directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column does not automatically populate and you  must manually enter the information. You cannot edit this after you save  the purchase invoice created directly.</p>

<p>You need proper security rights to enter an Invoiced quantity different  from the Received but not Invoiced quantity for inventoried items.</p>
