<h1 id="refund-dialog-box---prior-payments">Refund Dialog Box - Prior Payments</h1>

<p>This tab is displayed when you receive a refund on a purchase order  from a foreign currency vendor. If you make advance payments to the vendor  (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you  to specify the payment that must be applied as a refund.</p>

<p>This tab comprises two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Available</strong> - Displays all available deposits on the current  purchase order. Available deposits are those that are not applied on a  purchase invoice.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Applied</strong> - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the &gt; and » buttons to move  the available deposits from the <strong>Advance 
 Documents Available</strong> column to this column. You can change the amount  being applied in the <strong>Amount</strong> column.</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field (path: <strong>Refund</strong> dialog box  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When you receive a refund, a transaction is automatically created in  a payment journal.</p>
