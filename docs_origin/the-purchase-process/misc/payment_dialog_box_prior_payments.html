<h1 id="payment-dialog-box---prior-payments">Payment Dialog Box - Prior Payments</h1>

<p>This tab is displayed when you refund the payment received from a foreign  currency vendor on a debit order . If you receive advance payments from  the vendor (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab  allows you to indicate the refund that must be applied as a payment.</p>

<p>This tab comprises two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Available</strong> - Displays all available deposits (i.e., deposits  not applied on a debit memo) on the current debit order.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Applied</strong> - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the &gt; and » buttons to move  the available deposits from the <strong>Advance 
 Documents Available</strong> column to this column. You can change the amount  being applied by editing the <strong>Amount</strong>  column.</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field (path: <strong>Payment</strong> dialog box  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When you refund a payment, a transaction is automatically created in  a payment journal (for the amount applied).</p>
