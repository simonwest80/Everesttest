<p>When you convert a purchase order or receipt to a purchase invoice,  you can make updates to the line item information. If you change the cost  of any line items, the system automatically balances the Accrued Purchases  account so that the purchase invoice stays balanced with the purchase  orders/receipts.</p>

<p>You may also modify the following information before you save the invoice:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase invoice  date</li>
  <li>Location/sub-location</li>
  <li>Document alias</li>
</ul>
