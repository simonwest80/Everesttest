<h1 id="ship-to-address">Ship to Address</h1>

<p>The <strong>Ship To</strong> field specifies  the address to which the vendor must ship the items ordered. For return  documents this field displays the address to which you must ship the returns.  This may be your warehouse or office address.</p>

<p class="note">When the shipping address is not defined for  a purchase or purchase return document, the system prints the document’s  location address in place of the shipping address.</p>

<p class="hint">You would ideally set up all the addresses  at which you receive items in the Vendor profile of at least one vendor.</p>

<p>When you select a vendor code, the default <strong>Return</strong>  address specified in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Purchasing</strong> &gt;  <strong>Vendors</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Address</strong>  tab) is displayed in the purchase document profile.</p>

<p>If a default address is not defined in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile, this field will be blank. You can change the <strong>Ship 
 To</strong> address.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Everest</strong>  also allows you to select an address of any other vendor or customer from  the <strong>Addresses</strong> browser.</p>
