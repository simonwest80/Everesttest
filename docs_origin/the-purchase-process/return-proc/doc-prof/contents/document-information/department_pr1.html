<h1 id="locationsub-location">Location/Sub-Location</h1>

<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field in a purchase  return document displays the location or the sub-location to which the  document belongs. When a new quote, order or memo is created, the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field displays the login  location/sub-location. You can change the location or sub-location.</p>

<p>When you assign a location or sub-location to the document, you can  keep track of purchase return documents by location/sub-location and print  reports required for management information purposes.</p>

<p class="example">You can generate a report of all debit quotes  raised by the purchase department to review the estimated purchase returns  of the location/sub-location.</p>

<p>Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers</p>

<p>The document’s location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Locations/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a location/sub-location  is selected, the address and logo of the sub-location’s location is used.</p>

<p>Processed Documents</p>

<p>As documents are converted from one type to another (quote, order, memo),  the location/sub-location specified in the original document is carried  throughout. You can change the location/sub-location before posting the  purchase journal for the debit memo.</p>

<p>Different Location/Sub-Location for Vendor and Document</p>

<p>When the location/sub-location assigned to the vendor in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab)  is different from that of the document, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you with a message to that effect, asking you whether you want  to change it. You can choose to change the document’s location/sub-location  by clicking ‘Yes’.</p>

<p class="note">You can set the preference <strong>Allow 
 user to open only those purchasing documents which belong to his/her default 
 location/sub-location</strong> in the <strong>Documents</strong> dialog box <strong>** (path: **Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow</strong> <strong>Control</strong><strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Others &gt; Others 2</strong> tab)  to ensure that users are allowed to open only those documents that belong  to the user’s location/sub-location.</p>
