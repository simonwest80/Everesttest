<p>The <strong>Transactions</strong> tab displays  the accounting entry that was created in the system when the debit memo  was saved. The tab displays details such as the accounts that have been  debited or credited, amount of debit/credit, the purchase journal and  transaction number in which the entry was recorded, the document number  and date, and the source of the transaction.</p>

<p class="note">This tab is displayed only on a saved debit  memo.</p>

<p>You can view the amounts in base currency or the vendor’s currency.  To view the amounts in base currency, select the option <strong>View 
 in Base Currency</strong> from the right-click menu. This is a toggle option.</p>
