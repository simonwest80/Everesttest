<h1 id="shipment-tracking-information">Shipment Tracking Information</h1>

<p>The <strong>Shipment Tracking</strong> tab in  a purchase return document allows you to enter the tracking number for  the shipment. The tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system  using a bar code scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered  with different delivery methods for each shipment.</p>

<p class="note">This tab is displayed only on a saved debit  memo.</p>

<p>The shipment date defaults to the login date and the delivery method  defaults to the document’s delivery method. You can change these as required.</p>

<p>Use this browser when you return items to your vendor using multiple  delivery methods. If you ship the items using only one delivery method,  you can enter the shipment tracking number in the <strong>Shipment 
 Tracking</strong> # field of the <strong>Debit</strong><strong>Order</strong> or <strong>Debit 
 Memo</strong> profile.</p>
