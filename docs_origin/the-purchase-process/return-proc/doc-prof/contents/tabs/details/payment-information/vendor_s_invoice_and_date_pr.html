<p>These fields displayed in purchase return documents, are used to specify  the RMA number, and the date on which you receive the RMA document from  the vendor. This may be the credit order number the vendor uses for your  returns, or the number of the original purchase receipt that contained  the items you intend to return.</p>

<p class="note">If you enter an RMA number which already exists,  you are warned about it. However, you can choose to enter the same number.</p>
