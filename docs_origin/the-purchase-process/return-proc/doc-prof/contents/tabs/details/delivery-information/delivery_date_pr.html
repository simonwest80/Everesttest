<p>Delivery Date on a Debit Quote or Order</p>

<p>The <strong>Delivery</strong> <strong>Date</strong> field in a debit quote or a debit order allows you to specify the date of expected delivery of the shipment.</p>

<p>The delivery date on orders helps you in planning inventories.</p>

<p>Delivery Date on a Debit Memo</p>

<p>The delivery date on a debit memo identifies the date when the items were actually returned, as there could be a time lag between the time the items were returned and the date when the debit memo was created.</p>
