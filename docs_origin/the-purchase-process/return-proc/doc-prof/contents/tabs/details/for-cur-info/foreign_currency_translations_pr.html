<h1 id="foreign-currency-translations">Foreign Currency Translations</h1>

<p>When the document currency is a foreign currency, amounts in foreign  currency are translated into the base currency using the exchange rate  for the document. The translation formula applied depends on the quote  type set in the <strong>Currency</strong> profile  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Multi-Currency</strong> &gt; <strong>Currency</strong>).</p>

<p>The translation formula applied depends on the quote type.</p>

<p><strong>Where the quote type is Foreign to Base, the  translation formula is:</strong></p>

<p>Foreign Currency Amount * (Exchange Rate/Quote Amount)</p>

<p><strong>Where the quote type is Base to Foreign, the  translation formula is:</strong></p>

<p>Foreign Currency Amount * (Quote Amount /Exchange Rate)</p>

<p class="example">If your base currency is the US Dollar, and the document  currency is Great Britain Pounds (GBP), and the rate is expressed as 1  GBP = 1.42064; then 1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote  type <strong>foreign</strong> <strong>to</strong><strong>base</strong> as 1000* (1.42064/1) = 1420.64.</p>

<p>If the rate is expressed as 1 USD = 0.703973 GBP, then  1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote type <strong>base</strong><strong>to</strong> <strong>foreign</strong>  as 1000* (1/0.703973) = 1420.64.</p>
