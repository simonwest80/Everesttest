<p>The <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Memo</strong>  is the third and final step in the purchase return process. It is created  when inventoried items are actually returned to the vendor or an allowance  is given by the vendor for unsatisfactory services.</p>

<p>The debit memo in <strong>Everest</strong> thus  serves a dual purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Records 
 return of items</strong> - The debit memo acts as a Goods Dispatched Note  as items are taken out of inventory only after their return is recorded  on a debit memo.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounts 
 for purchase returns</strong> - The debit memo is the base document to account  for the amount of purchase returns.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The debit memo is a final document. It is  on the basis of the debit memo that inventory values, vendor balances,  stocks and accounts payable are updated. Accounting entries are automatically  generated when a debit memo is created.</p>
