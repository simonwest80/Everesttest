<p>Although a debit memo can be directly created when the items are returned,  creating a debit order has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Materials</strong><strong>planning</strong> - Helps track the items  on order and backorder, and the expected dates of return. This allows  you to plan the usage of your materials and make decisions on placing  new orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Returning 
 items for repair or exchange</strong> - You can attach items to a debit  order and move them to a stock area for exchange/repair without removing  the item from stock. When the repaired item is received, you can detach  the item from the debit order and close the order.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking 
 items to be returned</strong> - Items to be returned can be assigned to  a different stock area; this will ensure that these items are not sold  or used.</li>
</ul>
