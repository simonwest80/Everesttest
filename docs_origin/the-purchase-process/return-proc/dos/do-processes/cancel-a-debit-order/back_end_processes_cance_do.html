<p>When a debit order is canceled the following back end processes occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The debit order  is converted to a debit quote.</li>
  <li>If the cancelled  debit order was originally converted from a quote, it is converted to  a debit quote with the number of the original quote.</li>
  <li>If the canceled  debit order was created without converting an existing debit quote, it  gets converted to a debit quote with the debit quote number assigned to  the debit order (when it was created).</li>
  <li>The sequence number  of the cancelled debit order is not available for further use in other  debit orders.</li>
  <li>The quantity ‘on  debit’ for the item reduces.</li>
</ul>
