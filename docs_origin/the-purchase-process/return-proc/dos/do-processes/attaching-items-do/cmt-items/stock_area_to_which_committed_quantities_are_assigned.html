<p>The committed items on a <strong>debit order</strong> are assigned to the ‘Stock’ type of stock area. They continue to  remain in your ownership<font style="color: #0000ff;" color="#0000FF">. </font></p>

<p>The stock area to which committed quantities are assigned is determined  by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you specify  a default stock area for debit orders in the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas 
 &gt; For Purchase &gt; Assign Inventory to/from</strong> section <strong>&gt; 
 Debit Order</strong>), the quantities are assigned to this stock area.</li>
  <li>If you do not  specify a default stock area in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box, the items are assigned to the stock area defined  in the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/  <strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock</strong> <strong>Transfer</strong>  &gt; <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Document</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Select stock area to transfer 
 inventoried items into when assigning</strong> section &gt; <strong>Debit 
 Order</strong>) of the logged in location/ sub-location.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If the stock  area is not defined for the logged in location also, the items will continue  to remain in the stock area from which they are committed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The stock area to which committed quantities are assigned  on a debit order is the same for a document, irrespective of the workstation  settings or flow control settings when committing the quantities.</p>

<p class="example">You commit quantities on Item 1 of debit order  #10012, and the stock area determined is ‘Vendor Returns Expected’. You  save the order and then change workstation settings for debit orders to  ‘Vendor RMA’. If you reopen order #10012 and commit quantities for Item  2, the stock area assigned continues to be ‘Vendor Returns Expected’.  However, if you commit quantities on a purchase order on which no items  are committed, the stock area used is ‘Vendor RMA’.</p>
