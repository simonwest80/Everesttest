<h1 id="partial-returns">Partial Returns</h1>

<p>You can create partial debits against a single order to account for  orders that are returned in stages.</p>

<p class="example">If you intend to return five computers, but  actually return only three, you can create a memo for the three items.  The debit order is assigned the status ‘Backorder’ until the remaining  items are returned.</p>

<p>You can view this status on the document profile and in <strong>Status</strong>  column of the <strong>Debit Orders</strong> browser.  This status is assigned until the remaining items are returned when the  status changes to ‘Closed’.</p>
