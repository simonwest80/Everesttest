<h1 id="advanced-find">Advanced Find</h1>

<p>This tab facilitates an advanced search and you can specify multiple  search parameters. This is a more complex option than the other tabs in  the <strong>Find</strong> filters, and is extremely  useful to narrow down your search to meet your requirements.</p>

<p>The parameters chosen in any of the tabs (such as <strong>Quick 
 Find</strong>) are listed here. If required, you can modify some of the  conditions.</p>

<p class="example">In the <strong>Find Tasks/Appointments</strong>  dialog box, choose the following parameters to construct a condition to  find completed tasks related to purchase quotes and purchase invoices:</p>

<p><strong>Quick Find</strong> tab: Select Tasks  and Completed only</p>

<p><strong>Document/Account</strong> tab: Select  Purchase Quotes and Purchase Invoices in the <strong>Purchase 
 Document Type</strong> field.</p>

<p>Based on these specifications, the following condition is displayed  in the <strong>Advanced Find</strong> tab:</p>

<p>Contact management module in 2 and</p>

<p>Status equals T  and</p>

<p>Document type in (1,3)</p>

<p>The condition statement can be edited to suit your search requirements.</p>

<p class="note">You cannot edit all parameters in the <strong>Advanced 
 Find</strong> condition. Only the parameters which have an enabled check  box (that can be selected/deselected)  beside them can be edited.</p>

<p>The parameters that are changed/edited in the <strong>Advanced 
 Find</strong> tab do not get automatically updated in the other tabs.</p>

<p class="example">The condition statement can be edited to find tasks related to sales  quotes and sales invoices, that have been completed by a selected sales  representative. It can be altered in the following way:</p>

<p>Contact management module in 2 and</p>

<p>Status equals T  and</p>

<p>Document type in (7,9) and</p>

<p>Assigned User in AK</p>
