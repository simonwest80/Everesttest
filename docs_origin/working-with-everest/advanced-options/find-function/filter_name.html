<p>While creating a filter, you can choose the name that most closely describes  your search. You can save the filter and store them in <strong>Everest</strong>.  You can access this filter whenever you want information using the parameters  stored in the filter.</p>

<p class="example">Create a filter for <strong>Contact Manager 
 &gt; Find Tasks/Appointments</strong> from the main menu. Save the filter  by name ‘Find Pending Tasks’ using ‘pending’ and ‘tasks’ as the parameters.</p>

<p>Choose the filter from the drop-down list. The <strong>Find 
 Task/Appointment</strong> dialog box gets populated automatically with all  the parameters saved earlier. You can choose to modify or add to the existing  parameters.</p>

<p class="steps">To run a filter, already created in Everest,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, click the <strong>Filters</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/img/wwe_filters_menu_icon.gif" alt="" /> icon. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/misc/filters_drop_down_menu_options.html"><strong>Filters Drop-Down Menu</strong></a>, containing  the filter options.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Filters can also be accessed from the drop-down  main menus that they belong to.</p>
