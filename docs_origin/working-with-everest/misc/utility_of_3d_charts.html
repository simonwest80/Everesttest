<p>The advantages of implementing 3D charts in browsers are that each functional  group in the organization can create the charts and comparisons that they  want based on their requirements.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>Sales</strong> can derive graphs such  as Yearly Sales by Sales Representative and Yearly Sales by Location/Sub-location.</p>

<p><strong>Purchasing</strong> can derive graphs  such as Monthly Purchases by Vendor or Purchases by Location/Sub-location  by Vendor.</p>

<p><strong>Finance</strong> can derive reports such  as Monthly Sales Taxes by Jurisdiction that will help in Sales Tax payments.</p>

<p><strong>Payroll</strong> department would be  able to obtain graphs for comparison of payroll expenses based on location/sub-location  and periods. For example, reports such as Monthly Payroll Expenses by  Payroll Item, or Yearly Payroll Expenses by location/sub-location.</p>

<p><strong>Management</strong> can obtain graphs  for comparing incomes within years or from year to year. Reports such  as Quarterly Performance Comparison will give the management a view of  Sales in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 by location/sub-location. Likewise for costs.</p>
