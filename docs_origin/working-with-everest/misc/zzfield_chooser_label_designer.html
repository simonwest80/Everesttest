<p>The <strong>Field Chooser</strong> displays a  list of all the columns available in the browser that you accessed the  label designer from. The first four fields, namely <strong>Company 
 Code</strong>, <strong>Company Name</strong>, <strong>Location/Sub-Location Code</strong>, and <strong>Location/Sub-Location Name</strong>, in the <strong>Field Chooser</strong>, are permanent.  Multiple  copies of any of the data fields or bar codes can be added. Objects can  be added to the label by just clicking and dragging the object from the  <strong>Field Chooser</strong> to Label design  area<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="note">Only the columns shown in the browser are  displayed in the <strong>Field Chooser</strong>.  If a field you need is missing, you must close the <strong>Label 
 Designer</strong> dialog box, add the missing field to the browser and reopen  the <strong>Label Designer</strong> dialog box.</p>
