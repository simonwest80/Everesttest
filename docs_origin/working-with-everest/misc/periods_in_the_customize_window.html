  <dt><strong>Fiscal Year</strong></dt>
  <dd>The fiscal year is a calculated year in which the  relevant date falls. This is computed based on the fiscal year of the  login date. <strong>Everest</strong> works backwards  from the fiscal year of the login date and calculates the 12-month period  in which the transaction date of the document falls.</dd>
  <dt>If the fiscal year for the login date is April 2004 - March 2005 and  the transaction date is December 23, 2003, then the fiscal year displayed  is 04-01-2003 to 12-31-2004.</dt>
  <dd>This year may differ from the actual fiscal year  when the document was created.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">If the fiscal year was the calendar year until 2003 after which you  changed the fiscal year to the period April - March; then the fiscal year  column in the browser will still show the calculated fiscal year.</p>

  <dt><strong>Month Week</strong></dt>
  <dd>The month week is the week of the month (such as  the 2nd or 4th) in the calculated fiscal year for the relevant date.</dd>

  <dd>The quarter is the number of the quarter (such as  Q2 or Q4)<font color="#FF0000" class="hcp6"> </font>in the calculated fiscal year for  the relevant date.</dd>
