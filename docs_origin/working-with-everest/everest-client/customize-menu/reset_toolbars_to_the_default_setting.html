<p>Toolbars that have been changed/modified can be reset to their original  settings. This can be done universally for all toolbars or for each toolbar.</p>

<p class="steps">To reset toolbars throughout Everest:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>Options</strong> tab of the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/misc/customize_dialog_box.html"><strong>Customize</strong> dialog box</a>, click <strong>Reset my usage data</strong>. You will be prompted  to confirm that you want to proceed with the resetting.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to reset all the toolbars.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">This option is available only if the <strong>Enhanced</strong> or <strong>Flat</strong> option has been selected as the <strong>Bar 
 Style</strong> in the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Current Environment Settings</strong> &gt;  <strong>General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>This option will not, however, affect any customization. This means  that any customization that you have done manually will not be reset when  this option is selected. Only your usage data (which is statistics on  how many times you clicked each menu) is reset.</p>

<p class="steps">To reset a particular toolbar, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/img/wwe_drop_down_icon.gif" alt="" /> icon on the required toolbar and select <strong>Add 
 or Remove Buttons &gt; Reset Toolbar</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">This option is available only for toolbars  that are available in <strong>Everest</strong>  by default, and not for toolbars that you have created.</p>
