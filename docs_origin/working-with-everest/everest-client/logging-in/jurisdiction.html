<p class="note">You can select only an <strong>In</strong>  type of jurisdiction while logging in. By default, an <strong>In</strong>  jurisdiction with code ‘DEF’  is created with a new company. This jurisdiction has no effect on any  of your transactions and is only for the purpose of logging in. You need  to create your own jurisdictions in order to enable the system to determine  the correct tax jurisdiction.</p>
