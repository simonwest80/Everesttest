<h1 id="filter-records-using-the-column-filter">Filter Records Using the Column Filter</h1>

<p>Filtering is a quick way to find a subset of data in a browser. A filtered  browser displays only those records that contain the value you specified.</p>

<p class="example">You can filter the <strong>Sales 
 Invoice</strong> browser to display only those invoices that were created  by a particular sales representative.</p>

<p class="steps">To filter a browser using the column filter,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the required  browser select <strong>Options &gt; Properties</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Browser Property Editor</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>General</strong> tab, select the <strong>Show 
 column filters</strong> check box.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to return to the browser. You will  see arrows to the right of the header columns in the browser.</li>
  <li>To filter the  browser for a particular value, click the arrow in the required column  header and select the value from the drop-down list.</li>
  <li>You can apply  additional condition(s)  to other column(s)  based on the value selected in the previous column by repeating the last  step in the other column(s).</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">After  filtering the browser for a particular sales representative, you can further  filter it for the sales invoices that have an outstanding balance of more  than $10,000.</p>

<p>The filter arrows in columns that have selected values are blue. You  can filter values in more than one column at the same time.</p>

<p class="note">When records are filtered using the column  filter, <strong>Everest</strong> displays the details  of the filter above the browser’s status bar.</p>

<p class="example">If the <strong>Amount</strong>  column in the browser is filtered for amounts above $1,000 the browser  contains the following message<img src="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/img/wwe_column_filter_message.gif" alt="" />. Click on <strong>X</strong>  to clear the filter that has been applied to the browser.</p>
