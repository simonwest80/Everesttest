<p>This tab allows you to specify the parameters for a 3D chart. A 3D graph  or chart has an added third dimension called the Z-axis  using which the user can view graphs that are three-dimensional and based  on group totals.</p>

<p class="example">A graph of yearly sales by sales rep. shows  the value of sales in the Y-axis,  the years in the X-axis and sales for each sales rep. for the year in  the Z-axis.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Title</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the title of the graph in this field. By default  the name of the browser is displayed in this field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Y-axis</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify whether the Y-axis  should display the value of the records or the number of records in the  selected criteria. If <strong>Value</strong> is  selected, choose a numeric field for the field in the Y-axis  column. If <strong>Record Count</strong> is selected,  you cannot select a field for the Y-axis  since the number of records for the criteria specified in the X- and Z-axis  is displayed here.</dd>
</dl>
