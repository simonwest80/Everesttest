<p><strong>There are three ways to log in to Everest:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Double-click  on the <strong>Everest</strong> icon <img src="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/img/wwe_eae_logo.gif" alt="" /> on your desktop.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Windows Start</strong> menu select <strong>Programs 
 &gt; Everest Advanced Edition &gt; Everest</strong>.</li>
  <li>Double-click  on the <strong>Everest.exe</strong> file. This  file will be present in the directory specified at the time of installing  the <strong>Everest</strong> client.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click on the <strong>Everest.exe</strong> you  will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/everest-client/the_everest_login_dialog_box.html"><strong>Everest 
 login</strong></a> dialog box.</p>

<p><strong>Logging in to your company is a two-step procedure:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>You must <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/everest-client/logging-in/login_company_database.html">log in to the company database</a> and  specify the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/everest-client/logging-in/login_user.html">user details</a>.</li>
  <li>You then specify  the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/everest-client/logging-in/jurisdiction.html">jurisdiction</a> and <a href="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/everest-client/logging-in/login_department.html">location/sub-location</a>.  The jurisdiction logged into determines the amount of sales tax to be  charged. Revenue and expenses will be accounted for in the logged-in location/sub-location.  All sales and purchase documents are created for the logged-in location/sub-location.  The location/sub-location specified also determines which logo will be  printed on documents.</li>
</ul>
