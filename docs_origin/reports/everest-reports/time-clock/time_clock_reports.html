<p><strong>Time Clock</strong> reports assist in  organizational management, to track and manage employee attendance and  leave. Based on these reports, management can keep track of salary payable  to employees, leave balances, etc. The organization can identify employees  who have not put in the required number of working hours. Employees who  have put in extra working hours may also be identified and rewarded. <strong>Time Clock</strong> reports include:</p>

</ul>

<p>The time displayed in the Time Clock reports is the time recorded in  the original transaction. The Time Clock utility in <strong>Everest</strong>  uses time zone and daylight savings time settings from the local workstation’s  operating system. Once recorded, the time does not change when viewed  with other time zone or daylight saving time settings.</p>
