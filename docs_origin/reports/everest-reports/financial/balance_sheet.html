<h1 id="balance-sheet">Balance Sheet</h1>

<p>The <strong>Balance Sheet</strong> report displays  a summary of all assets, liabilities, expenses and income for an accounting  period. The excess of the balance of revenue accounts over the expense  accounts as on that date is shown as current earnings under equity.</p>

<p>The account groups in the balance sheet are shown up to five levels.  If there are more than five levels, the balances are summed up and shown  against the parent group of level five.</p>

<p>This accounting period may be a month, quarter (a block of three months)  or year depending on your requirements. The report is critical to a business  as it determines the performance of a business during a specified period  of time.</p>

<p>The balance sheet is prepared with the posted balances. You can also  include provisionally posted or unposted amounts, and hide accounts with  zero balance by selecting the required parameters.</p>
