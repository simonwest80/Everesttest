<p>The <strong>Accrued Purchases</strong> report  provides you with information about the Accrued Purchases account grouped  by account, vendor, and document number in base currency. It also helps  ensure that the Accrued Purchases account matches the trial balance. The  Accrued Purchases amount debited/credited for purchase orders get matched  against the Accrued Purchases amount debited/credited for the corresponding  purchase receipts and purchase invoices to highlight any differences.  The Accrued Purchases amount debited/credited for purchase receipts created  directly get matched against the Accrued Purchases amount debited/credited  for the corresponding purchase invoice. The report displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the purchase orders,  receipts, and invoices numbers</li>
