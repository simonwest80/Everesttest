<p>The <strong>Best Item (Purchase)</strong> report  displays quantities and cost information for items purchased over a period.  The report can be sorted based on the maximum quantities purchased or  the maximum purchase value for the items purchased. The cost displayed  is the net cost (i.e. value of the line items on purchase invoices minus  value of line items on debit memos), including manual documents. The report  can be an excellent source for analyzing items which are purchased in  large volumes and those items contributing to a large fraction of the  total cost of procurement. The report displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item code, item  description and the unit of purchase measure for each item</li>
  <li>Date range and  the net cost amount (i.e. total amounts for line items on purchase invoices  minus debit memos), including all manual documents (if the report is sorted  based on Cost)</li>
  <li>Date range and  the net purchase quantity (if the report is sorted based on Quantity)</li>
  <li>Cost per Unit of  each item</li>
</ul>
