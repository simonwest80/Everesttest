<p>Select this check box to select and display documents based on the payment  date. This check box is enabled only if you select the <strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong> check box.</p>

<p class="example">While accounting for GST on a non-cash basis in Australia, you can claim  input tax credits (GST credit on Purchase) when your supplier has issued  an invoice or when you have paid them, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>However, if an advance is paid against  a purchase order during a reporting period and the items are not received  (i.e., the purchase order is not converted to a purchase receipt), the  input tax credit on this purchase order cannot be claimed in that period.</p>
