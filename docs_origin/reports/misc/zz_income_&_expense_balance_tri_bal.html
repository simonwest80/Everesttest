<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to allocate  expenses and revenues to specific locations or sub-locations. This option  allows you to select the display of  income  and expense balances in the trial balance report.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consolidated 
 for all Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>– If this option is selected, a single consolidated  amount is displayed against each account.   This  amount represents the total balance of that account and includes unallocated  amounts and allocations made to all locations/sub-locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakup 
 for all Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>– If this option is selected, the balance  in each income and expense account is broken up into unallocated amounts  and amounts allocated to each location/sub-location.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Amounts displayed against locations and sub-locations  with sub-sub-locations only relate to amounts specifically allocated to  that location and sub-locations; the balance does not include balances  of sub-sub-locations for that account.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Selected 
 Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>– If this option is selected, the balances of income  and expense accounts displayed pertain to amounts allocated to the selected  location/sub-location only.</li>
