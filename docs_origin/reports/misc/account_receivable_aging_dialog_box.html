<p>If there are only Unposted sales Journals and no receipt journals, then  none of these sales documents appear in the report when the <strong>Posted 
 Transactions Only</strong> option is selected.</p>

<p>Similarly if there are Unposted sales Journals with corresponding receipt  journals that are still Unposted, then the report will still not display  these sales journals.</p>

<p class="example">Create a sales receipt for $200 but do not  post the corresponding sales journal in <strong>Everest</strong>.  Make a $100 receipt and do not post the receipt journal. If you select  the option <strong>Posted Transactions Only</strong>,  then neither the sales journal nor the receipt journal appears in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the Unposted receipt transaction are not  displayed.</p>

<p>Where a sales journal is yet to be posted, but the corresponding receipt  journals have been posted, then the report will display the document amount  as zero. In this situation, the document <strong>Paid</strong>  column will show the paid amount from the receipt journal and the document  balance will be displayed as negative since Document Amount (0) - Document  Paid (xxx) = Document Balance (-xxx).</p>

<p class="example">Create a sales receipt for $200 but do not  post the corresponding sales journal in <strong>Everest</strong>.  Make a $100 receipt and post the receipt journal. If you select the option  <strong>Posted Transactions</strong> Only, the  posted receipt journal is displayed but the document amount is zero, the  document paid shows the paid amount ($100) and the document balance is  negative (-$100).</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the posted receipt transaction are displayed.</p>

<p>If there are posted sales journals without any corresponding posted  receipt journals, then the sales journal appears in the report with the  document amount displayed, however the <strong>Paid</strong>  column is zero and the document <strong>Balance</strong>  column displays the document amount (which means the document is still  outstanding).</p>

<p class="example">Create a sales receipt for $200 and post it  in <strong>Everest</strong>. Make a $100 receipt  but do not post the receipt journal. If you select the option <strong>Posted 
 Transactions Only</strong>, the posted sales journal is displayed with the  document amount as $200.00; the document <strong>Paid</strong>  shows the paid amount as $0.00 (since it is not posted) and the document  balance is $200.00 (the entire amount displayed still outstanding).</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the Receipt transaction are not displayed,  since the receipt transactions are not posted.</p>

<p>If there are posted sales journals and the corresponding receipt journals  have been posted, then the sales journal appears in the report with the  document amount displayed. The document <strong>Paid</strong>  column displays the actual value from the Posted receipt journal and the  document <strong>Balance</strong> column displays  the correct balance that is still outstanding (if any).</p>

<p class="example">Create a sales receipt for $200 and post it  in <strong>Everest</strong>. Make a $100 receipt  and post the receipt journal. If you select the option <strong>Posted 
 Transactions Only</strong>, the posted receipt journal is displayed, with  the document amount as $200.00; the document <strong>Paid</strong>  column shows the paid amount as $100 and the document <strong>Balance</strong>  is $100 (since only $100.00 is still outstanding).</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the posted receipt transaction are displayed.</p>

<p>If the user has created only manual receipt journals without a corresponding  sales journal and the receipt journal is yet to be posted, you will not  find these receipt journals in this report.</p>
