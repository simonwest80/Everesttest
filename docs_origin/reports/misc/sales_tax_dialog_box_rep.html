  <dd>Specify the type of report you want to generate.  Select Summary to view the tax totals by date without line item details.  Select Detailed to display the line item details for system documents.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">In the case of manual journals where you have  not assigned any tax codes, the report displays manual documents using  the journal’s jurisdiction tax code. If you have assigned a tax code to  some but not all taxable and exempt entries, entries with a tax code appear  under the appropriate tax code while entries without a tax code appear  under the tax code “–.”</p>

<p>Also note that some manual journals may have  separate line entries with different tax codes selected. In this case,  the manual journal number will appear multiple times on the report as  each tax code lists its own tax values.</p>
