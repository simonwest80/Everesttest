<ul>
  <li>If you do NOT  select the <strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong> check  box, documents that bear a date within the date range specified in the  <strong>Date From</strong> and <strong>Date 
 To</strong> fields are selected and displayed in the report.</li>

<ul>
  <li>If you select  the <strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong> check  box and NOT the <strong>Consider Payment Date</strong> check box, documents which have a tax invoice date falling within  the report period are considered.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you select  both the <strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong> and  <strong>Consider Payment Date</strong> check boxes:</p>
  </li>
  <li>All purchase invoices  which have the vendor tax invoice date or the payment date within the  report period are considered.</li>
  <li>If the payment date  of the document is during an earlier reporting period, the purchase invoice  date is considered.</li>
  <li>If the payment date  and the vendor tax invoice date fall in a subsequent reporting period  (when compared to the purchase invoice date), the earlier of the two dates  is considered.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/reports/img/example.gif" alt="" /> The  purchase invoices considered in this report are illustrated by the following  example:</p>
