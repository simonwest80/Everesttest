</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Serial numbers  present in the system are not available physically</li>
  <li>Serial numbers  available physically are not present in the system</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>: For serial numbers to print in this report, they  must be present somewhere in the system. If the serialized items are available  in the system but are not physically present in the stock bin, they display  as “Unmatched Serial # from system” in the report. If the serialized items  are available physically in a stock bin which is different from the stock  bin in the system, they display as “Unmatched Serial # from phys. Count”  in the report.</dt>
  <dd>To print such serial numbers, select the <strong>Print 
 Serial # Discrepancy Details</strong> check box. For auto-serialized items,  serial numbers along with manufacturer’s serial numbers are printed.</dd>
