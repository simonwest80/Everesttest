<p>This option allows you to specify whether you want to see a summarized  or detailed report of the taxes. In both report types the dates are organized  as indicated in the Grouped By option. Select <strong>Summary</strong>  to see just the tax totals for each date. Select <strong>Detail</strong>  to display the tax details for every item contained on each sales or sales  return document.</p>

<p>Because manual documents do not include line items, the Detail report  represents the tax values of manual documents using the <strong>Item 
 used for displaying manual documents in tax reports</strong> setting (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong>  &gt; <strong>Items</strong>).</p>
