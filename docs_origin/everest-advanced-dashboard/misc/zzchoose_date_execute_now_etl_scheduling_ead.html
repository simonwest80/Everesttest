<p>Use the <strong>Choose Date</strong> option to  choose an arbitrary date and <strong>Everest</strong>  will extract records back to the chosen date. If you choose a date that  is before the date of the last successfully loaded record, the previously  collected data in the data mart will be overwritten. This option may take  longer than a normal ETL run.</p>
