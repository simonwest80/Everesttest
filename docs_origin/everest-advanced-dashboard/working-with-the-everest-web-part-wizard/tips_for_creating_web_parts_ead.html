<p>Use the following tips to create better web parts and to streamline  web part creation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try to create web  parts that are easily understood at a glance and are meaningful to your  end users.</li>
  <li>Instead of creating  a web part from scratch, you can export the web part .dwp file of a web  part you would like to use as a starting point and rename it. Follow the  <strong>Import 
 a Web Part</strong> procedure to import the renamed web part .dwp file  to your dashboard site and follow the <strong>Modify a Web Part</strong> procedure  to change it to your specifications. Follow the <strong>Rename a Web Part</strong> procedure  to change the title of the web part. This will save you additional time  when creating web parts.</li>
