<p>Use the <strong>ETL History</strong> browser  to view status information on the most recent or current ETL job. You  can determine when the last run occurred, if the run was successful, and  how many records were processed. If the ETL job had errors, you can locate  the details for them in the <strong>ETL History 
 Details</strong> browser. Historical information may also display if you  have migrated from a previous version of <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p class="note">If the ETL job is still running, the history  will have a start time but no stop time.</p>

<p class="steps">To access the ETL History browser, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From  the main menu bar, select <strong>Utility &gt; 
 Data Warehouse &gt; ETL History</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows information on the <strong>ETL 
 History</strong> browser columns:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Column Heading</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stop Time</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Status</td>
      <td>This is the status of the ETL run.  It  shows as “IN PROCESS” when the ETL job starts and as either “SUCCESS”  or “FAILURE” when complete.<br /><br /><br /><strong>• IN PROCESS</strong> –  The job is still running.<br /><br /><br /><strong>• SUCCESS</strong> –  The job finished successfully.<br /><br /><br /><strong>• FAILURE</strong> –  The job did not finish successfully or timed out.</td>
