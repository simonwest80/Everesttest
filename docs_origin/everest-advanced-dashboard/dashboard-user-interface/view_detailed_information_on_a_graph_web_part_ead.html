<p>You can view detailed information on any web part. If you see something  of interest in the web part, you can “drill down” into the information  to find specifics on the information displayed. You are not limited to  only drilling down on the web part information. Once you access the data  behind the web part, you can also expand the data being presented.</p>

<p class="steps">To view detailed information on a graph web  part, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select a graph  web part to view.</li>
  <li>Click the name  of the graph web part in the title bar. The name is a link to the associated  pivot table information associated with the web part.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/margin graph web part with title link selected.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Margin Web Part with Title Link Selected</strong></p>

<p class="example">When you glance at the <strong>Margin</strong>  web part, you notice that the Sales Margin is lower than you expected.  To get more information on this, you click <strong>Margin</strong>  in the title bar to open the pivot table to access additional data.</p>

<p>The pivot table for the selected web part  is displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Pivot Table/Graph for the Margin Web Part</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the <strong>Maximize</strong> button <img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/pivot table maximize button.gif" alt="" /> to expand  the pivot table/graph to full screen.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pivot Table/Graph for the Margin Graph Web Part  Maximized</strong></p>

<p class="note">To view only the Pivot Table, from the Pivot  Table/Graph menu bar select <strong>View &gt; 
 Pivot Table</strong>. To view the Pivot Table and Graph, select <strong>View 
 &gt; Pivot Table/Graph</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add fields to the  Pivot Table to “drill down” into it further and see more details.</li>
  <li>Change the filters  within the Pivot table to “drill up” and see more data in your filter.</li>
  <li>To disseminate  this information to other employees in your company, you can e-mail your  Pivot Table information to them.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">You review a web part that shows the Sales  for your top five customers for the week. You notice that your best customer  is not listed.  You  use the filter to look at the data for the month and see that your best  customer is listed as the top customer.  By  viewing the data, you notice that your best customer had an extra large  order for the previous week. You e-mail your warehouse manager and let  the warehouse workers leave early based on the information you located  on your <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>.</p>
