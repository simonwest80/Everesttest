<p>The <strong>Forms</strong> browser is used to  view and manage profile versions but not all users can open the <strong>Forms</strong> browser. The <strong>Forms</strong>  browser can only be opened by a user with the <strong>View</strong>  security right. This gives the user the ability to open and view the <strong>Forms</strong> browser only.</p>

<p>Additional rights are needed to create, assign, rename, purge, import  and export profile versions. The <strong>Forms</strong>  browser security rights are listed in the following table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Security Right</td>
      <td>Path Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Form Browser: View</td>
      <td>File &gt; Setup &gt; Forms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Form: Rename</td>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Rename</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Form: Purge</td>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Purge</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Forms Browser: Export</td>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Export Forms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Forms Browser: Import</td>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Import Forms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Forms Browser: Set Default Form</td>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Set as Default</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If users try to open the <strong>Forms</strong>  browser without the associated security rights, the <strong>Forms</strong>  browser will not open and they will receive a security message.</p>
