<p>In order to ensure that the Forms Designer functionality is used properly,  audit tracking is utilized to monitor activity. Management can then view  the Forms Designer events in a log. Events are logged by the system when  a profile version is created, modified, removed, or assigned. The following  specific events are logged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A profile form is created</li>
  <li>A profile form is modified</li>
  <li>A profile form is deleted</li>
  <li>A user is assigned to a form</li>
  <li>A group is assigned to a form</li>
</ul>

<p>For each event logged, the particular profile version of the form is  also recorded.</p>
