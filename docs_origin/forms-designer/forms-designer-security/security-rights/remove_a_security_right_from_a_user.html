<p>Forms Designer security rights are removed from users in the same way  that other security rights are removed in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p class="steps">To remove an assigned Forms Designer security right from  a user in Everest, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main menu bar, select <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Security 
 Rights</strong>. The <strong>Security Rights</strong>  browser is displayed.</li>
  <li>Verify that the <strong>Users</strong>  tab is selected.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Left Panel</strong>,  locate and highlight the Forms Designer security right to be removed.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Users 
 Assigned</strong> section, highlight the user to have the selected security  right removed and click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/forms-designer/img/arrow to right.bmp" alt="" /> button to move the user’s  name to the <strong>Users Not Assigned</strong>  section.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>  to save your changes and remove the selected security right from that  user.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="note">
  <li>You can also double-click  an item to move it from the <strong>Users Assigned</strong>  section to the <strong>Users Unassigned</strong>  section without using the arrows.</li>
  <li>Forms Designer  security rights can similarly be removed from groups of users using the  <strong>Security Rights</strong> browser – <strong>Groups</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>
