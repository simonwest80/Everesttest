<p>In the Forms Designer utility, individual security rights are used to  give authorized users the ability to create, rename, purge, import and  export forms. Additional security rights are needed to view the <strong>Forms</strong> browser, assign forms to users,  and assign forms to groups. These levels of security are necessary since  the Forms Designer utility is a very powerful profile-customization tool  and only qualified users should be able to customize profiles and assign  them to other users.</p>
