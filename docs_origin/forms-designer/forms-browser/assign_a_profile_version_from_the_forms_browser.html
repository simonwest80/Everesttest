<p>The <strong>Forms</strong> browser makes it easy  to manage the customized profile forms that you create. Along with editing,  renaming, and purging versions of profile forms that you create, assignments  can be made and changed for users and groups from the <strong>Forms</strong>  browser.</p>

<p class="note">: Do not assign any forms other than the standard  form to the user with the Forms Designer privilege. This ensures that  all necessary design options are always available to that user.</p>

<p>Manage User Assignments</p>

<p class="steps">To manage user assignments, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right-click the form version to be managed in  the <strong>Forms</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Assign 
 Forms</strong> &gt; <strong>Users</strong> to manage  the form user assignments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Manage Group Assignments</p>

<p class="steps">To manage group assignments, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right-click the form version to be managed in  the <strong>Forms</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Assign 
 Forms</strong> &gt; <strong>Groups</strong> to manage  the form group assignments.</li>
</ul>
