<p>End users can easily be overwhelmed by their software. This is especially  true if the screens contain numerous fields they do not use, field names  that are not familiar to them, and the overall design is not efficient  for their specific needs. You want the user’s environment to be simple,  streamlined, and contain wording that is familiar to them.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> currently allows users  to make adjustments to their profile views, but not everyone feels comfortable  or qualified to make these adjustments. In these situations, System Administrators  can make customizations for the end users in advance. These customizations  will be available to them when they log in to <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>Profile customization is possible with the <strong>Everest 
 Forms Designer</strong> utility. The System Administrator, or an advanced  user with the appropriate Forms Designer security rights, can customize  profile screens and even enhance security by limiting end user access  in the profile. The Forms Designer moves customization control away from  the end user to the System Administrator or another individual authorized  to design forms.</p>

<p>The customized views that are created can then be assigned to specific  users or groups of users. In this way, your existing and new end users  can be set up quickly and easily. These customizations can give your end  users a more favorable software experience and increase their productivity  at the same time.</p>
