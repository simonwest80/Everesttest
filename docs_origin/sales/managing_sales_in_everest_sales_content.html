<p><strong>**Everest</strong>  provides you with two ways to manage sales and customer returns:**</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>By creating sales  documents such as sales quotes, sales orders, sales invoices, and creating  sales return documents such as credit quotes, credit orders and credit  memos against them. The entire sequence of steps involved in creating  sales documents is called the sales process. The sequence of steps in  accepting returns is called the sales returns process. When sales tasks  are carried out through sales documents, **Everest</strong>  automatically generates accounting entries in a sales journal or receipts  journal. The journals in which system entries are recorded are called  system journals.**
    <ul>
      <li><strong>By making manual  accounting entries for sales in a sales journal. Manual entries cannot  be made in a system journal; they are made in manual journals. In this  case, only the amount received from the customer is recorded; details  of items sold are not provided.</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
