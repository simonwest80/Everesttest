<p>You can enter sales opportunity details such as source, grade, stage  and reasons for closure directly in a sales quote, order and invoice without  creating a sales opportunity first. Select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit Opportunity</strong> from the document profile to view the <strong>Sales Opportunity</strong> profile.</p>

<p>Maintaining sales opportunity details for sales quotes, orders or invoices  that are created directly is important for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can track  the stage in which the sales quote is.</li>
  <li>You can measure  the effectiveness of the various means of advertisement by keeping track  of the source of the sale.</li>
  <li>You can track  the reasons for clinching the order.</li>
</ul>
