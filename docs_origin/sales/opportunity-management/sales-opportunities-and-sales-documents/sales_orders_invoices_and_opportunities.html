<p>The opportunity details in a sales quote are carried over into the sales  invoice when the sales order is converted to a sales invoice. You can  also enter opportunity details for quotes, orders or invoices that are  created directly. This ensures that you are able to track revenue opportunities  and the reasons for closed opportunities.</p>
