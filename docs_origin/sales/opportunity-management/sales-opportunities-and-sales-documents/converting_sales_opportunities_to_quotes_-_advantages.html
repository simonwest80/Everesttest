<p>Converting sales opportunities to quotes has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You do not  lose the opportunity information.</li>
  <li>There is no  duplication of effort as a sales person need not recreate the opportunity  details in the quote.</li>
  <li>When the sales  quote is converted to an order, the opportunity is automatically closed  and updated with the closing date. The sales person need not replicate  the order details in the opportunity database.</li>
</ul>
