<p>The <strong>Reason Closed Setup</strong> browser  (path: <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Reason Closed</strong>) displays  all the reason closed groups and the corresponding reason closed choices  that are defined under each group.</p>

<p>The browser displays the <strong>Rank</strong>  column. The rank identifies the hierarchy of the reasons for closure.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  “Customer not Interested” is the reason why opportunities are  closed most frequently, you would define its rank as 1.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Up</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/sales_up_arrow.gif" alt="" /> and  <strong>Down</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/sales_down_arrow_button.gif" alt="" /> arrows to  change the rank of a reason for closure.</p>

<p>Options common to all browsers are also available in this browser.</p>
