<p>When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a reason closed group, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>** **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup</strong> <strong>&gt; Reason Closed</strong>. You will see the <strong>Reason</strong><strong>Closed</strong> <strong>Setup</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Reason</strong> <strong>Closed</strong><strong>Setup</strong> browser, highlight the reason  closed group that has to be discontinued.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Discontinue</strong>.  The record that was selected is no longer visible in the <strong>Reason</strong><strong>Closed</strong> <strong>Setup</strong>  browser.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">When you discontinue a reason closed group, the selections  under this group will also be deactivated from the <strong>Reason 
 Closed Setup</strong> browser.</p>
