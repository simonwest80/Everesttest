<p>Defining customer actions helps you analyze the course of action taken  by the customer at the end of the opportunity and sales cycle. You can  define:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/customer-action/customer-action-group/create_a_customer_action_group_profile.html">Customer  Action Groups</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/customer-action/customer-action-choice/create_a_customer_action_choice_profile.html">Customer  Action Choices</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> A  customer refuses to buy items from you because your competitor has offered  the same product at a lower price. You can create a customer action group  called ‘Lost Sales’ and the corresponding selection for the group can  be called ‘Customer chose competitor’.  You can then analyze the reason behind the loss of the sales deal.</p>
