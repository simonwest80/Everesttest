<p>When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a customer action choice,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup</strong> <strong>&gt; Customer Action</strong>. You will see the <strong>Customer</strong><strong>Action</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Action</strong>  browser, highlight the customer action choice that has to be discontinued.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Discontinue</strong>.  The record that was selected is no longer visible in the <strong>Customer</strong><strong>Action</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
