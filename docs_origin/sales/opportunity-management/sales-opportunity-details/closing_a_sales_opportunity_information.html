<p>Closed</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Closed</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to indicate that the opportunity  is closed.</dd>
  <dd>When a sales quote is converted to an order, or  when an order or invoice is created, this check box is automatically selected.  The close date is updated with the document date for the order or invoice.</dd>
  <dd>When an opportunity is lost or abandoned, you may  manually mark it as closed and select the close date and the reason for  closure.</dd>
  <dd>Therefore when this option is selected it could  indicate either of the following:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>The opportunity  has been processed to a sales order or invoice.</li>
  <li>The opportunity  has been abandoned due to some reason.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Actual Close Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is the date on which you mark the opportunity  as closed. The close date is automatically updated with the sales order  date when the sales quote for the opportunity is converted to an order.</dd>
  <dd>If you close an opportunity because your customer  is not interested in the product, or for any reason other than the fact  that the opportunity is converted to a sale, then the date has to be selected.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href=""></a>Reason Closed  Group</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option allows you to specify a group under  which the reason closed selection must belong. You can analyze the reason  an opportunity was closed based on the group you select.</dd>
  <dt>If a sales deal was closed because of the  high finance involved, you could specify the group as ‘Financial’.</dt>

  <dt><strong><a href=""></a>Reason Closed Choice</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option is used to identify the reason why the  opportunity was closed. It helps to track the reasons for success or failure  in converting potential sales.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/lens.gif" alt="" /> <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reasons_closed_sales_opp.html">Reasons  Closed</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>You can set a default preference by specifying options in the <strong>Reason Closed Group</strong> and <strong>Reason 
 Closed</strong> fields in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/misc/documents_dialog_box_sales_opportunity_tab.html"><strong>Documents</strong> dialog box</a> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Documents &gt; Opportunity</strong> <strong>Management</strong>  tab). When you convert a sales opportunity to a sales quote and subsequently  to a sales order, the <strong>Sales Opportunity</strong>  profile associated with the sales quote displays the default preferences  that you specify.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  can specify the default <strong>Reason Closed 
 Group</strong> as <strong>Won Deals</strong> and  the default <strong>Reason Closed Choice</strong> as  <strong>Best</strong> <strong>Price</strong>.</p>
