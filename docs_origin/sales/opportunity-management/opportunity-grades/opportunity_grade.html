<h1 id="opportunity-grades">Opportunity Grades</h1>

<p>The grade option allows you to rate whether the opportunity is good,  excellent, etc. Grading enables you to focus on opportunities with good  ratings.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> An  opportunity from a reputed company who is likely to give you repeat orders  is graded high. Whereas one from a company that does not have a good credit  rating would be graded lower.</p>

<p class="steps">To create a grade, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Grade</strong>. You will see  the <strong>Opportunity Grade</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Opportunity Grade</strong> browser, select <strong>Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/opportunity-grades/the_opportunity_grade_profile.html"><strong>Opportunity 
 Grade</strong> profile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can also create an opportunity grade from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any profile that  contains the <strong>Grade</strong> field.</li>
  <li>An existing <strong>Opportunity Grade</strong> profile by clicking  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong>.</li>
</ul>
