<p>If a customer wishes to return an item, you can create a credit order  directly from a saved <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>  profile by using the <strong>Generate Credit 
 Order</strong> option (path: <strong>Options &gt; 
 Utility &gt; Generate Credit Order</strong>).  All  the details present in the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>  profile are automatically copied into the <strong>Credit 
 Order</strong> profile saving the time of re-entering data.</p>

<p class="note">You can access the <strong>Generate 
 Credit Order</strong> option only from a <strong>Sales 
 Invoice</strong> profile.</p>

<p class="steps">To generate a credit order directly from  a Sales Invoice profile, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> profile, select <strong>Options &gt; Utility &gt; Generate Credit Order</strong>.  You will see the <em>**</em> <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/gen-co/generation_of_credit_order_browser_sales.html"><strong>Generation of Credit Order</strong> <strong>from 
 Sales Invoice</strong> browser</a> listing the items in the sales invoice  document for which no credit order has been created, for the sales transaction.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Generation of Credit Order</strong> browser,  choose the line items for which you want to create a credit order by selecting  the check box beside the item, and select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Create CO</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">By default all the items are selected.</p>

<p>You will be informed that a credit order has been created. You will  also be asked whether you want to open the credit order document. Click  <strong>Yes</strong> to view the <strong>Credit 
 Order</strong> profile. Click <strong>No</strong>  to return to the <strong>Generation of Credit 
 Order from Sales Invoice</strong> browser.</p>

<p>By default, a credit quote is created automatically when you create  a credit order from a sales invoice document. You can view the credit  quote details from the document status section of the credit order document.</p>
