<p>If a batch payment is pending for a document, you will see the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/batched_payments_pending.gif" alt="" /> icon displayed on the document status bar. Click the icon  to view the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser.</p>

<p class="note">The indicator is displayed on order and final documents  for any pending batch payment. It is, however, not displayed on closed  orders as <strong>Everest</strong> does not allow  you to make payments on such orders.</p>
