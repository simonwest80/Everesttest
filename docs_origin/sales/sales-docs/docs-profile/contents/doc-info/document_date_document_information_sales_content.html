<p><strong>If an opportunity is converted to a quote,  a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to an invoice,  the date displayed on the quote, order or invoice is the login  date on which the document was converted. You cannot change the date on  the document once it is saved.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/note.gif" alt="" /> The document date displayed  by default is the login  date. To create documents with different dates, you must login  with a different date.</p>
