<font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The location or sub-location 
 for the document is displayed by default. You can select another location 
 or sub-location to allocate revenues and expenses for the item.</font>

<p><strong>Change a Location/Sub-Location</strong></p>

<p>You can change the location/sub-location by selecting a different one  from the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field. Once  you change the location/sub-location, you will be prompted with a message  asking you whether you wish to change all the line item sub-locations  with the location/sub-location.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to replace the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column with the location/sub-location selected in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong>  field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>No</strong> to retain the original location/sub-location.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you click <strong>No</strong>,  the location/sub-location displayed in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column of the Item Details Grid does not change. The revenues and  expenses associated with the line item are allocated to the location/sub-location  specified in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column  of the Item Details Grid.</p>

<p>To retain the line item location/sub-location, you should  have security rights assigned to you.</p>
