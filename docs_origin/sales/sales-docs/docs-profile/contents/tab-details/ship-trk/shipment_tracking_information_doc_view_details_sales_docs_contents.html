<p>Select this option (path: sales order profile <strong>&gt; 
 Options &gt; Shipment Tracking Information</strong>) to view the <strong>Shipment 
 Tracking Information</strong> browser.</p>

<p>This browser allows you to enter the tracking number for  the shipment. The tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system  using a bar code scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered  with different delivery methods for each shipment. Your online customers  can view the tracking number entered in this browser.</p>

<p>The shipment date defaults to the login date and the delivery  method defaults to the document’s delivery method. You can change these  as required.</p>

<p>Use this browser when you ship items using multiple delivery  methods. If you ship the items using only one delivery method, you can  enter the shipment tracking number in the <strong>Shipment 
 Tracking</strong> field of the <strong>Sales</strong><strong>Order</strong> or <strong>Sales 
 Invoice</strong> profile.</p>

<p>If you have created a drop ship purchase order from a sales  order, the delivery method, the delivery date and the shipment tracking  number as entered in the drop ship purchase order, will be displayed in  this tab.</p>
