<p>Promotions or promotional campaigns are methods by which you can increase  your sales. You can offer discounts or free gifts on certain items for  a certain period to attract more customers.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You can  offer 10% discount to customers who buy goods from Dec 15th to Jan 15th,  and also track expenses and revenues associated with the promotion.</p>

<p>Promotion codes help to keep track of revenues that occur because of  promotion campaigns. You may also want to track the source of a sale based  on promotion codes for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To compute  the profits of printing a promotion campaign catalog.</li>
  <li>To gauge the  effectiveness of advertising and campaigns based on the source of sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>A promotion code is defined in the <strong>Promotion</strong><strong>Profile</strong> (path: <strong>Inventory 
 &gt; Discounts &gt; Promotions</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> <strong>&gt; 
 In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p>Promotion codes can be associated with a special pricing that is defined  in the <strong>Special Pricing Details</strong> section  of the <strong>Special Pricing</strong> dialog  box. You can associate a promotion code to a special pricing by selecting  the <strong>Promotion code required</strong> check  box and specifying a promotion code in the <strong>Promotion</strong>  field of the <strong>Special Pricing</strong> dialog  box (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Discounts &gt; 
 Special Pricing &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p>The <strong>Promotion Code</strong> field in  the sales document allows you to specify the promotion code to be applied  to the document. If you have specified a special price for the promotion  code in the <strong>Special Pricing</strong> dialog  box, and you select the promotion code in the <strong>Promotion 
 Code</strong> field, <strong>Everest</strong> asks  you whether you want to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep 
 the current prices</strong> - If you select this option, the price of the  item will not change. You are  allowed  to retain pricing on the document if you have adequate security rights.</li>
  <li><strong>Update 
 prices based on the new promotion</strong> - If you select this option,  the price is recalculated based on the price specified in the <strong>Special 
 Pricing</strong> dialog box. The updated price for the particular item is  then populated in the <strong>Item</strong> <strong>Price</strong> column of the sales document.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you select a promotion code that has expired, <strong>Everest</strong> informs you of the expired status  of the promotion code. You can apply this promotion code by selecting  <strong>Yes</strong> on the message.</p>
