<p>The <strong>Transactions</strong> tab displays  the accounting entry that has been created in the system when the sales  invoice was saved. The tab displays details such as the accounts that  have been debited or credited, entry type, amount of debit/ credit, the  sales journal and transaction number in which the entry was recorded,  the document number and date, the source of transaction, and posted status.</p>

<p>The <strong>Entry Type</strong> column provides  additional information regarding the accounting entry.</p>

<p class="example">This column allows you to easily view commissionable  costs of goods sold.</p>

<p class="note">This tab is displayed only on a saved sales invoice  document.</p>

<p>You can view the amounts in base currency or the customer’s currency.  To view the amounts in base currency, select the option <strong>View 
 in Base Currency</strong> from the right-click menu. This is a toggle option  that also allows you to view the amounts in the customer’s currency.</p>
