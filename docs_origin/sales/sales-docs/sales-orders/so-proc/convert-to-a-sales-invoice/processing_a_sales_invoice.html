<p><strong>A sales order can be processed to a sales  invoice using the **Process</strong> &gt;  <strong>Invoice</strong> option from the <strong>Sales Order</strong> profile. The details of  the order are copied to a <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>  profile; the quantity in the <strong>Committed</strong>  column appears in the <strong>Shipped</strong>  column by default. When the Sales Invoice is saved, the <strong>Shipped</strong>  column of the Sales Order is updated with the quantity shipped.**</p>

<p><strong>You can create a sales invoice every time  a shipment is made against the sales order.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Partial Shipments of Inventoried Items</strong></p>

<p><strong>If items are shipped in various stages  against a sales order, multiple sales invoices can be created for the  same sales order.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If five computers are  ordered but only three are shipped initially, a sales invoice can be created  for the three items that are shipped. Later when the rest of the computers  are shipped, another sales invoice can be created.</p>

<p><strong>When a partial shipment is made the status  of the sales order changes to **Back Order</strong> on the document and in the <strong>Sales 
 Orders</strong> browser. When all the items are shipped, the sales order  status changes to <strong>Closed</strong>.**</p>
