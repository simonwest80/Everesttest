<p>The back end processes when a payment is received against a sales order or sales invoice document are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer’s un-posted amount as seen in the <strong>Customer</strong>’s profile reduces by the amount of payment. The amount receivable from the customer reduces. When the receipt journal for the receipt is posted, the un-posted amount increases and the posted amount reduces with the amount receivable from the customer staying the same.</li>
  <li>The amount received on the sales order or sales invoice increases.</li>
  <li>If the amount is paid by applying a credit memo, the customer’s balance is reduced by the amount applied and the amount payable to the customer on the credit memo reduces by the amount applied.</li>
</ul>
