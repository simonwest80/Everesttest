<h1 id="the-refund-dialog-box---prior-payments">The Refund Dialog Box - Prior Payments</h1>

<p>This tab is displayed when you make a refund on a sales order to a foreign  currency customer. If you receive advance payments from the customer (over  a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you to  specify the payment that must be applied as a refund.</p>

<p>This tab comprises two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Available</strong> - Displays all available deposits on the current  sales order. Available deposits are those that are not applied on a sales  invoice.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Document Applied</strong> - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the &gt; and » buttons to move  the available deposits to this column. You can change the amount being  applied in the <strong>Amount</strong> column.</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field (path: <strong>Refund</strong> dialog box  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When you refund a deposit, a transaction is automatically created in  a receipt journal.</p>
