<h1 id="credit-card-processing-for-refunds">Credit Card Processing for Refunds</h1>

<p>Refunds may have to be made against a credit card payment that is authorized  and captured. A credit card payment is automatically processed when the  payment method for the credit card has the <strong>Use</strong><strong>Payment Processor</strong> check box selected  in the <strong>Credit Card Processing</strong>  tab (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt;</strong><strong>Credit Card Processing</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When a refund is made, the charge to the credit card is reversed and  amounts are transferred from your merchant account back to the credit  card holder’s issuing bank.</p>

<p class="steps">To refund a payment to a customer, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Order/Invoice</strong> profile, select  <strong>Options &gt; Payment &gt; Refund</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/refunds-on-so/the_refund_dialog_box.html"><strong>Refund</strong>  dialog box</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the  appropriate credit card payment method in the <strong>Payment 
 Method</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Enter the amount  to be refunded in the <strong>Amount</strong> field.</li>
