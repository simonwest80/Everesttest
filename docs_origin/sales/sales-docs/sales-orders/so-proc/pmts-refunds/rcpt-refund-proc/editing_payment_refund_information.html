<p>You can modify the payment/refund only from an unposted <strong>Receipt</strong><strong>Journal</strong>.</p>

<p>If any modifications are made to the receipt journal, the document payment  information is also updated. A receipt journal can also be voided. The  balance payable on the document then includes the amount of payment that  was voided.</p>

<p>You can reverse the payment received from a customer by using the <strong>Refund</strong> option on the <strong>Sales 
 Order</strong> or <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> profile  (path: <strong>Options &gt; Payment &gt; Refund</strong>).</p>
