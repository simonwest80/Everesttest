<p><strong>Use the **Mark 
 Open</strong> option to re-open a closed order.**</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You mark an order as complete  when the customer no longer needs shipment of an item. At a later stage,  if the customer wants the item, you can mark the order as open.</p>

<p>The status of a closed sales order may  be changed to open by increasing the quantity ordered or adding new items  on the order, though it is not mandatory.</p>

<p>If you try to save a closed sales order  after adding a new item or increasing the ordered quantity, <strong>Everest</strong>  asks you whether you want to increase the quantity or add new item. If  you click <strong>YES</strong>, the order is saved  and the status changes to “Backorder” if there are partially  shipped quantities or to “Open” if the quantity shipped is zero.  If you click <strong>NO</strong>, the status remains  open and changes are not saved.</p>

<p>If you try to re-open a closed order without  adding new line items or increasing the ordered quantity, you will not  get any message.</p>

<p class="note">If you save an order after modification/addition of  inline notes or extended notes, the order status remains closed. You need  to select the <strong>Mark Open</strong> option  to re-open the order.</p>

<p class="steps">To mark an order open, you must do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the closed  sales order.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">To view closed orders, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Shipped Sales Orders</strong> from the <strong>Sales 
 Orders</strong> browser.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add the item  to be ordered if the item does not exist on the order.</li>
  <li>If the item  to be ordered exists on the sales order, increase the quantity ordered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When items are added to the sales order  and the document is saved, the status of the order changes to ‘Open’.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Back End Processes - Mark a Sales Order Open</strong></p>

<p><strong>When an order is marked open, its status  changes to **Open</strong>. The order is  displayed in the <strong>Sales Orders</strong>  browser.**</p>
