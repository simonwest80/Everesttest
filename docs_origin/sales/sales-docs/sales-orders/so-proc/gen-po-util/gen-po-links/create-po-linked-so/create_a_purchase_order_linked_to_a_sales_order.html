<p class="steps">To create a purchase order linked to a sales  order, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From a <strong>Sales Order</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Generate Purchase Orders &gt; Generate Linked PO</strong>. You will  see the <strong>Generate Linked PO</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Generate Linked PO</strong> browser, select the  items for which the linked purchase order must be created and choose <strong>Options &gt; Generate Linked POs</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the process of generating the purchase orders is complete, you  will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/misc/the_purchase_order_status_browser_po_with_links_sales.html"><strong>Purchase Order Status</strong> browser</a> wherein  a new purchase order is generated for each vendor.</p>

<p class="note">A single purchase order is created for two line items  on a sales order that have the same vendor.</p>

<p>The creation of a purchase order cannot be undone. The default shipping  address of the vendor is displayed in the ship to address column of the  purchase order. The delivery method in a linked purchase order is the  same as the default delivery method of the vendor.</p>

<p class="note">When purchase orders are created for all items on the  sales order and you try to create a purchase order with links again, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts you that all the non-drop  ship items have purchase order references.</p>

<p>The <strong>SO #</strong> column in the Item  Details Grid of the <strong>Purchase Order</strong>  profile displays the sales order number from which the purchase order  has been created.</p>
