<p>Inventoried items may be committed to a sales order in the following  situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You physically  issue the items but do not remove it from total stock (i.e. transfer ownership)  until it is inspected and approved by the customer.</li>
  <li>You identify  and segregate the items that are to be shipped against a sales order.</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot commit items on orders belonging to discontinued customers.</p>

<p><strong>The **Committed</strong>  column in the <strong>Sales Order</strong> profile  displays the quantity of the item that has been committed on the sales  order. Committed items on a sales order are recorded in an ‘In type’ of  <strong>Stock Area</strong>.**</p>

<p><strong>The quantity committed on a sales order  cannot exceed the quantity ordered. However, if the committed quantity  exceeds the ordered quantity, **Everest</strong>  informs you of the same. You are prompted to confirm that you want to  proceed.**</p>

<p>If you choose to continue, the ordered quantity gets updated to equal  the committed quantity. This is applicable to all items - serialized,  non-serialized or auto-serialized.</p>
