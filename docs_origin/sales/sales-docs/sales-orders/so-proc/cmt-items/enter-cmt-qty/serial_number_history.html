<p>When a serial number is attached to the sales order or sales invoice,  an entry is made in the <strong>Serial Number 
 History</strong> browser. It provides details of the stock areas and the  documents to which a serial number was assigned.</p>

<p>You can view this browser by selecting <strong>Options 
 &gt; Serial Number History</strong> from the <strong>Sales 
 Order/Sales Invoice</strong> profile or browser.</p>
