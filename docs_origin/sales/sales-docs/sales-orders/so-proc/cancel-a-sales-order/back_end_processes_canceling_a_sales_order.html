<p><strong>The following back-end processes occur  when a sales order is canceled:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The sales order  is converted to a sales quote.</li>
  <li>If the canceled  sales order was originally converted from a quote, it gets converted to  a sales quote with the number of the original quote.</li>
  <li>If the canceled  sales order was created directly, it gets converted to a sales quote with  the sales quote number assigned to it.</li>
  <li>The sequence  number of the canceled sales order cannot be used again.</li>
  <li>The quantity  ‘on reserve’  for the item reduces and available stock increases.</li>
</ul>
