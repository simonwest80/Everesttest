<p>Pick tickets are required to inform the inventory and stores personnel  about orders that have to be picked and packed on any day.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pick Ticket</strong> function ensures  timely and accurate delivery of products to customers by integrating warehouse  and distribution functions with sales order processing.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pull Sheet</strong> <strong>Wizard</strong>  in <strong>Everest</strong> simplifies the picking  process. This wizard allows you to take the following decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How you want  the pick tickets to be generated.</li>
  <li>Whether priority  is required for back orders and sales orders.</li>
  <li>The stock bins  from which items can be pulled.</li>
  <li>The order of  picking.</li>
  <li>The method  for allocating quantities of non-serialized items tracked for lots.</li>
</ul>

<p>The wizard also provides you with an advanced filter for determining  the sales orders for which you want to create pick tickets.</p>

<p>If you indicate that certain items are critical to the shipment, the  <strong>Pull Sheet</strong> <strong>Wizard</strong>  considers these as well.</p>
