<p>This section allows you to select the method for allocating quantities  of non-serialized items tracked for lots. You can choose to allocate quantities  either automatically (by the system) or manually.</p>

<p>Automatically allocate available quantities</p>

<p>Select this option to allocate available quantities of non-serialized  items to the sales order automatically. The allocation can be based on  the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Earliest 
 expiry date</strong> - Out of the stock that is available in the selected  stock bins (selected in the <strong>Stock 
 Bin Selection</strong> section) for allocation to various sales orders,  the lot numbers are assigned according to the “Earliest expiry date of  the lot”. The lot that is expiring first is picked up first.</li>
</ul>

<p>Manually allocate quantities</p>

<p>If you select this option, the system will consider the total quantity  that is required and the quantity that is available for allocation to  the various sales orders. When you try to enter the quantity for non-serialized  items tracked for lots, you will see the <strong>Assign 
 Quantity</strong> profile. The profile shows only the stock bin allocated  for that line item.</p>
