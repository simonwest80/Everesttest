<h1 id="pull-sheets">Pull Sheets</h1>

<p>A pull sheet is created to identify sales orders that can  be shipped and guide the picker to stock bins from which items have to  be picked. Pull Sheets created using the <strong>Pull 
 Sheet Wizard</strong> often have multiple sales orders that can be pulled,  each represented by a separate pick ticket.  Multiple  pickers can work from a single pull sheet by using the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> browser.</p>

<p>Pull sheets display all items that need to be shipped.  They  can be printed and used to indicate the items a picker can bring to a  staging area.  When  this type of fulfillment is used, a second step of sorting the staged  items and putting them in boxes for their required shipment is required.   Pull sheets  have a column for warehouse position that can be used to sort the items  before printing.  This  will give the pickers a logical route through the warehouse to increase  efficiency.</p>
