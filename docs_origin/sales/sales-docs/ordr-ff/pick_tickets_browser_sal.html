<h1 id="pick-tickets-browser">Pick Tickets Browser</h1>

<p>The <strong>Pick Tickets</strong>  browser (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt;  <strong>Pick Tickets</strong>) displays all the  pick tickets of open pull sheets that have been previously created. After  the pull sheet is created, pickers will go through the warehouse to physically  retrieve items. When they return to a packing station, they open a pick  ticket from this browser to verify they picked the correct items and commit  them to the sales order.</p>

<p>You can search for a pick ticket by entering or scanning  the pick ticket number.</p>

<p>This browser lists the pick tickets by their number and also  displays the user code, date and time of creation of the pick tickets.  Different users can open pick tickets from the same pull sheet at the  same time. When a user opens a pick ticket, the pick ticket is locked  so that another user cannot process any order from the same pick ticket  at the same time.</p>

<p class="note">When a pick ticket number scanned or entered  in the Pick Ticket# field is invalid, a message displays to indicate that  the pick ticket number is invalid.</p>
