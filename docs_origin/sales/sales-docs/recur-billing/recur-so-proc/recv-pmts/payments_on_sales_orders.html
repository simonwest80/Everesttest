<h1 id="payments-on-sales-orders">Payments on Sales Orders</h1>

<p>Customers often make deposits against the sales orders. You can receive  deposits against an order by selecting the <strong>Receive</strong>  option.</p>

<p class="steps">To receive payments on a sales order, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Order</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Receive</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/pmts-on-so/rcpt-dlg/the_payment_dialog_box.html"><strong>Receipt</strong> dialog box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Receive</strong>  option is enabled only on existing sales orders that have been saved.  On a new sales order the option will be available only when the sales  order is saved.</p>

<p>When you click the <strong>Receive</strong> option,  <strong>Everest</strong> checks if there are pending  transactions in the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser (sale, authorization, pre-authorization and others) for that document.  If pending transactions are found, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you whether you want to process existing batch payment(s) or receive  new payment.</p>

<p>Selecting <strong>Process existing batch payments</strong>  option opens the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser for processing the document.</p>

<p>To receive new payments, you should have appropriate security right.</p>

<p class="note">The amount that you see in the message is the sum of  the value of all pending batch payments (sale, authorization, pre-authorization  and others) for the document.</p>
