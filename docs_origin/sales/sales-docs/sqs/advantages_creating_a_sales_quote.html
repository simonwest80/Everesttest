<p>Although you can create a sales order without creating a sales quote,  the advantages of creating a quote are elucidated below.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Comparative 
 Analysis of Quotations made to Customers</strong> - The sales quote records  customer information, product information, terms of the sale and other  details. This allows you to compare and analyze quotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Track 
 Sales Opportunities</strong> - A sales quote is an opportunity for sales.  Creating sales quotes allows you to track sales opportunities from sales  quotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Record 
 Customer Negotiations</strong> - You can record important points in the  sales quote that were brought up during customer negotiations.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage 
 Customer Contacts</strong> - The sales quote is the basis for your negotiations  with the customer. It is very useful to have the details of a quote when  negotiating with the customer. The contact manager feature in <strong>Everest</strong> allows you to associate tasks and appointments with a specified  sales quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimizes Data Entry while Creating Sales Orders</strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2"> - When a sales quote is converted to an order, the information 
 in the sales quote flows into the sales order thus reducing data entry.</font></li>
</ul>
