<p>Creating a sales quote is the first step in the sales process. Sales  quotes (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Quotes</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>) contain details  of quotations sent to customers. Creating sales quotes helps your invoicing  department to plan sales efforts and track the sales stage that each quote  is in. The sales quotes created will be displayed in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The sales funnel  report, and</li>
  <li>The sales analysis  by sales representatives report</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it is not mandatory to create a sales quote before creating  a sales order, it is recommended that you create a sales quote in the  following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For items that  are regularly sold - to keep track of the different rates at which you  offered items for sale.</li>
  <li>For service  contracts.</li>
  <li>To provide  an audit trail.</li>
  <li>For sales of  high value assets - to keep track of the quote issued to each potential  buyer.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/note.gif" alt="" /> A  sales quote is an intermediate or pending document in <strong>Everest</strong>  (since this is not the final stage of the sales process) and no accounting  entry is generated at this stage.</p>
