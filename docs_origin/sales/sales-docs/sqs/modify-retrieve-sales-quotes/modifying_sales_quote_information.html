<p>You can modify all the information on a quote that has been saved, until  it is converted to an order.</p>

<p><strong>The **Sales 
 Quote</strong> profile can be modified from any one of the following locations:**</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Sales 
 Quotes</strong> browser - Highlight the record and select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In Current Window/In New Window</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Sales 
 Quote</strong> profile - Specify the document number of the required quote  in the <strong>Document #</strong> field.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>After the sales quote is converted to a  sales order, it ceases to exist as a sales quote in the system and cannot  be retrieved or printed.</strong></p>
