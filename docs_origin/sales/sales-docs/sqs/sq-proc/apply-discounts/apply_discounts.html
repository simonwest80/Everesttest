<p>Discounts are calculated based on the discount schemes set up for items  in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Apply Discounts</strong> option must  be used in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the option  <strong>Automatically apply item discounts applicable 
 to a customer when retrieving the item on a document</strong> is not selected  in the <strong>Documents</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document payments</strong> tab).</li>
  <li>When modifications  made to the discounts are calculated and applied. Selecting the <strong>Apply Discounts</strong> option re-calculates  discounts available to the customer on all the items and overwrites the  modifications made.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To apply the discounts, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Quote/Sales Order/Sales Invoice</strong>  profile, select <strong>Options &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Apply Discounts</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The discounts defined are applied. They can be viewed in the <strong>Discount 
 Value</strong> and <strong>Discount %</strong> columns  of the Item Details Grid.</p>
