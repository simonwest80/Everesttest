<p>Lease and rental plans are compared in this section.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Everest</strong> does not distinguish between lease and rental plans. Both are created  from the same <strong>Lease Plan</strong> profile.</li>
  <li>Rental plans  are used when you want to rent out your product to a customer but do not  want to transfer the ownership. Lease plans are used when you want to  lease out the product to the customer and also transfer the ownership.</li>
  <li>The main difference  between the lease plan and rental plan is that in case of a lease, the  leasing company would buy your product and lease it to the customer. In  case of rent, you rent the product to the customer.</li>
</ul>
