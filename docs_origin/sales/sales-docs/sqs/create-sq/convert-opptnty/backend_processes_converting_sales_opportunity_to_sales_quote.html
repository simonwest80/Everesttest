<p>The following back-end processes occur when a sales opportunity is converted  to a sales quote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Opportunity 
 ID</strong> number becomes the <strong>Sales Quote</strong> number since <strong>Everest</strong> puts  sales opportunities on par with sales quotes.</li>
  <li>You can no  longer view the sales opportunity from the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunities</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>All opportunity  details are carried over to the sales quote. You can access the <strong>Sales Opportunity</strong> profile by selecting  <strong>Options &gt; Edit Opportunity</strong>  from the <strong>Sales Quote</strong> profile.</li>
</ul>
