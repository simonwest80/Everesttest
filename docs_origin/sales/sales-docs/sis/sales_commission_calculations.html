<p><strong>Commissionable/Non-commissionable  Revenues</strong></p>

<p>Revenues can be classified into commissionable  and non-commissionable.  This helps you in computing the commissions to be given to the sales staff  at the end of a period. The <strong>Include in 
 commission report calculation</strong> check box and the <strong>Commission 
 Rate %</strong> in the <strong>Item</strong> profile  (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> tab)  facilitate in doing this.</p>

<p>The <strong>Commission Report</strong> calculates  the commission that must be given to the sales representatives for the  sales made by them.</p>
