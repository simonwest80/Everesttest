<p>Payments may be received against a sales invoice either by applying  deposits or advance documents available or by receiving a new payment.</p>

<p><strong>Method for Applying Deposits on a Sales Order  to a Sales Invoice</strong></p>

<p>To select the method for applying the deposit received on a sales order  while converting it into a sales invoice, you have to select your option  in the flow control preferences (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Prompts</strong>&gt; <strong>Sales 
 Document</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales Document</strong><strong>2</strong> tab).</p>

<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>

<p>You can also refund amounts paid on a sales invoice to the customer  from the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> profile.</p>

<p>If the document is a foreign currency document, and you do not specify  a default account in the <strong>G/L 
 account for gain/loss on settlement of foreign currency documents</strong>  fields (path<strong>: File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency 
 &gt; Accounting</strong> tab), a message is displayed stating that payments  on foreign currency documents result in gain or loss on translation. Since  <strong>Everest</strong> requires a default account  to record gain or loss on foreign currency transactions, a preference  has to be set for the default G/L  accounts, to account for gain and loss on settlement of foreign currency  documents.</p>

<p>Set a default account in EITHER the <strong>G/L 
 account for gain on settlement for foreign currency documents</strong> field  OR the <strong>G/L 
 account for loss on settlement for foreign currency documents</strong> field  to be used for both gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.</p>
