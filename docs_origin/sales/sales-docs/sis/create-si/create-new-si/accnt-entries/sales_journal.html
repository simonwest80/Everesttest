<p>The accounting entries for sales are entered in an ‘open’ system <strong>Sales Journal</strong> that fulfills the following  conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the journal group selected in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation 
 Settings</strong>) <em>**</em> of the user entering  the sales/sales return.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user creating the sales invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such <strong>open</strong> journal exists,  a new sales journal is created. The sales journal number for the new journal  is taken from the sequence number specified for sales journals in the  logged in location or sub-location.</p>
