  <li>Select the <strong>Exclude from pull sheet and invoice</strong>  option if committed line items should NOT appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items will NOT be selected on the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> preview, and therefore, will not appear on the pull sheet.   Manually  committed items will still be invoiced if they are part of a sales order  that is converted using the Pull Sheet.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Include in the pull sheet</strong> option if  committed items should appear on the Pull sheet. The manually committed  line items will be selected (checked) on the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> preview, and therefore, will appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items are indicated in bright green on the <strong>Pull Sheet</strong> browser for easy reference.  This lets you know that inventory is already committed to the item. This  option is selected by default when a new filter is created.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If a line item has inventory committed from  multiple stock bins, each bin will be shown on separate lines in the Pull  Sheet and Pick Ticket report.</p>
