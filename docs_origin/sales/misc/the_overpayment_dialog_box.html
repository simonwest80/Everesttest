<h1 id="the-overpayment-dialog-box">The Overpayment Dialog Box</h1>

<p>The <strong>Overpayment</strong> dialog box appears  when you receive on a sales order or sales invoice an amount greater than  the value of the sales order or invoice. It also appears when you convert  a sales order with a negative balance to a sales invoice because the sales  invoice, as a final document, cannot have a negative balance.</p>

<p>The Overpayment dialog box offers several options for the overpaid amount.  You may return it to the customer, apply the overpayment as a deposit  towards future sales to this customer, or leave the amount as a negative  balance on the sales order.</p>

<p>If you choose to return/refund it to the customer, the system creates  a refund entry in the Receipt Journal.</p>

<p>If you apply the overpayment as a customer deposit, the system credits  the amount of overpayment to the Customer Deposit Account specified in  the Customer Deposit field (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Posting Group</strong> profile) of  the Customer Posting Group and generates a manual document for the customer.</p>

<p>If you choose to leave the negative balance on the sales order, the  sales order retains the negative balance. When making an overpayment on  a sales invoice, the negative balance applies to the sales order you converted  into the sales invoice. In the case of a sales invoice created directly,  the sales invoice itself will retain the negative balance. This is the  only case which allows a sales invoice to carry a negative balance.</p>

<p class="note">You may not make an overpayment for batch  processing.</p>
