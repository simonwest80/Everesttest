<p>MO is the abbreviation for Mail Order and TO for Telephone Order. Transactions  where card details are provided by the cardholder over the phone or by  mail are called MO/TO transactions. They are also known as card-not-present  transactions. In such transactions, authorization has to be obtained first.  The funds are normally captured only after the items have been shipped  to the cardholder. Visa and MasterCard  in the United States allow capture of funds on MO/TO transactions only  after delivery.</p>
