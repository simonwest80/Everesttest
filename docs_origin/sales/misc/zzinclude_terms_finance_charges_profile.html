<p>This section allows you to specify the document payment terms that have  to be included. Include terms by double clicking in the check box beside  the payment terms. Only five payment terms can be included at one time.</p>

<p class="note">You can only include terms or exclude terms. That is  you cannot include a few payment terms and exclude other payment terms  at the same time since these options are mutually exclusive.</p>
