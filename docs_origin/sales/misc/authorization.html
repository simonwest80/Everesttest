<h1 id="authorization">Authorization</h1>

<p>An authorization is a request to charge a cardholder. When a charge  is authorized, the cardholder’s available limit reduces, but the funds  are not actually captured. The card is not billed until a request is made  by the merchant to capture the transaction.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> Your  customer, who has a credit limit of $10,000, places an order for goods  worth $4000. The available limit reduces to $6000 although the customer  is not required to pay the $4000 until you send a request with the authorization  code for capturing the funds. The funds are then transferred to your account  and the customer’s account is debited.</p>
