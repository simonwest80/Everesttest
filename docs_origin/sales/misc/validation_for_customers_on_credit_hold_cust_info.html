<p><strong>Everest</strong> prompts you that the  customer is put on credit hold in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As soon as a customer,  who is on hold, is retrieved into a new sales order or invoice.</li>
  <li>When the customer  is not on hold at the time of selection but exceeds the credit limit at  the time of saving the document.</li>
  <li>If you edit a document  for which the customer is on hold and try to save it.</li>
</ul>
