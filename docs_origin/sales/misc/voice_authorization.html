<p>Sometimes processing networks decline transactions with a referral message  indicating that the merchant must call the cardholder’s issuing bank to  complete the transaction. The payment information is then submitted over  the phone. If the transaction is approved, the merchant is provided with  an authorization code for the transaction. This process is called voice  authorization.</p>
