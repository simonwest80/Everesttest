<p>Items from sales quotes, orders, invoices and credit memos can be copied  into any sales document. This saves you data entry in case you have to  create quotes where the item information exists on another sales document.  Copying items from sales documents is also useful when you create a single  sale document by retrieving items that are contained in more than one  sales document.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Retrieve</strong> option (path:  Sales Document <strong>** profile **&gt; Options &gt; Retrieve &gt; Copy of</strong> &gt; <strong>&lt;Document 
 Name&gt;</strong>) to add items from more than one document into the current  sales document.</p>

<p class="steps">To retrieve items contained in a sales invoice  into a credit memo, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Memo</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Retrieve &gt; Copy of &gt; Sales Invoice</strong>. You will see the  <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong> browser, select the required  sales invoice and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
  <li>The item details  are retrieved into the credit memo.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Similarly items can be retrieved into any sales document  from sales quotes, orders, invoices and credit memos.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can open the document browser directly  from the main menu, click on the required document, and drag and drop  it into the current document profile.</p>

<p>Information pertaining to the customer of the original  document is not retrieved into the new document.</p>

<p>In case of serialized items, the quantity fields in  the Item Details Grid are not populated with values from the original  item.</p>
