<p>Select the <strong>Margin</strong> option to  compute the profit as percentage of the sale price. The sales price and  profit is computed from the <strong>Start Margin</strong> specified.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If the  cost of an item is $100 and the <strong>Start 
 margin</strong> is 10%, and the <strong>Margin 
 step</strong> is 2%, the price of the item is first computed on the starting  margin of 10 %. The <strong>Profit Breakup</strong> browser  displays the selling price as $111.10 with a profit of $11.11. The next  sale price will be $113.63 with a profit of $13.63 and so on.</p>
