<p>If you have defined a special tax rule for the jurisdiction specified  in the sales document, select the <strong>Special 
 tax rule override</strong> option to apply the tax code specified in the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> profile (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes 
 &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p class="note">The <strong>Document Override</strong> check box in the <strong>Rules</strong>  tab of the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> profile  has to be selected.</p>

<p>If the option selected in the <strong>Tax Calculation 
 Type</strong> field was previously set to <strong>Manual</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>verride</strong>  or <strong>Automatic</strong>, and you select <strong>Special tax rule override</strong>, the tax code  as defined in the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong>  profile is applied.</p>

<p>If no special tax rule is specified for the jurisdiction, you are prompted  with a message that you cannot override tax and no record with an override  option is found in the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong>  profile. Click <strong>OK</strong> to return to  the sales document.</p>

<p>The tax code defined in the <strong>Special 
 Tax Rules</strong> profile (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>) is also applied to the new items  added to the documents.</p>

<p class="note">When you manually change the tax code, the <strong>Tax 
 Calculation Type</strong> field displays the <strong>Manual 
 override</strong> option.</p>
