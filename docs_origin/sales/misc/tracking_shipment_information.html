<h1 id="tracking-shipment-information">Tracking Shipment Information</h1>

<p>It is normal business practice to inform the customer that items ordered  have been shipped and also provide them the tracking number for the shipment.  The tracking information helps the customer track the location of their  shipments and also helps in internal inventory planning using estimated  delivery dates.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to scan the  tracking numbers into sales orders/invoices as and when the items are  shipped. You can also directly enter the tracking number in the <strong>Shipment Tracking</strong> field on the document  profile.</p>

<p>From the <strong>Sales Order/Invoice</strong> profile  select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Shipment 
 Tracking Information</strong> to view the tracking numbers, the carrier,  the delivery method and delivery date of the shipment.</p>

<p>Shipment tracking numbers for purchase orders can be recorded in the  purchase order, receipt, or invoice directly.</p>
