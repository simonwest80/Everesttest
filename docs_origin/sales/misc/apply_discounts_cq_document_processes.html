<p>Discounts are calculated based on the discount schemes that have been  set up for items in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>The apply discounts option must be used in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the option  <strong>Automatically apply item discounts applicable 
 to a customer when retrieving the item on a document</strong> is not selected  in the <strong>Documents</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document Payments</strong> tab). In this case, discounts are calculated and applied if the  <strong>Apply Discounts</strong> option is selected.</li>
  <li>When modifications  are made to the discounts applied. If you select the <strong>Apply 
 Discounts</strong> option, <strong>Everest</strong>  re-calculates discounts available to the customer on all the items and  overwrites the modifications made.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To apply discounts, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Quote/Credit Order/Credit Memo</strong> profile,  select <strong>Options &gt; Customer</strong> &gt; <strong>Apply Discounts</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The discounts defined for the customer are applied to the item. You  can view these discounts in the <strong>Discount 
 Value</strong> and <strong>Discount %</strong> columns  of the Item Details Grid.</p>
