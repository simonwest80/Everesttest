<p>Select <strong>Yes</strong> to display back ordered  sales orders before “open” sales orders in the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> browser.</p>

<p class="example">You have three sales orders with the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1590 dated 1st June  2007</li>
  <li>1025 dated 15th May  2007</li>
  <li>1100 dated 16th May  2007 - This is a back order.</li>
</ul>

<p>This option (along with the <strong>FIFO</strong>  option) displays the items in the following order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1100 dated 16th May  2007</li>
  <li>1025 dated 15th May  2007</li>
  <li>1590 dated 1st June  2007</li>
</ul>

<p>If you select <strong>LIFO</strong> in the previous section, the sales orders display in the following  order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1100 dated 16th May  2007</li>
  <li>1590 dated 1st June  2007</li>
  <li>1025 dated 15th May  2007</li>
</ul>
