<p>When a new item is added to an existing sales return document to which  a job code has already been assigned, you will be prompted with a message  that states that a job code has been used in the document. You will be  asked whether you wish to apply the existing job code to the line item.  Click <strong>Yes</strong> if you want to assign  the existing job code to the line item or <strong>No</strong>  to return to the document.</p>
