<h1 id="verify-expiredclosed-job-codes">Verify Expired/Closed Job Codes</h1>

<p>When you assign a job code to a line item in a sales document, <strong>Everest</strong> verifies if the job code has  a status that is <strong>Closed</strong> and/or  <strong>Expired</strong>. If the job code has a  status that is closed and/or expired, you are prompted with a message  and asked if you still wish to use the job code.</p>

<p>You need appropriate security rights to assign a job code that is closed  and/or expired, to a line item.</p>
