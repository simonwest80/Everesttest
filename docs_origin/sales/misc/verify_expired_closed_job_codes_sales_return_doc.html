<p>When a job code is assigned to a line item in a sales return document, <strong>Everest</strong> verifies if the job code has a status that is <strong>Closed</strong> and/or <strong>Expired</strong>. If the job code has a status that is closed and/or expired, you will be prompted with a message that says that the job code is closed and/or expired. You will also be asked if you still wish to use the job code. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to use the job code. You need appropriate security rights to assign a job code that is closed and/or expired, to a line item. Click <strong>No</strong> if you do not wish to assign the job code to the line item in the sales return document.</p>
