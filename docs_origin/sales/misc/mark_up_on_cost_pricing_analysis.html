<h1 id="markup-on-cost">Markup on Cost</h1>

<p>Select the <strong>Markup</strong> option to  compute the profit as a percentage on cost. The sales price and profit  is computed from the <strong>Start Mark-up</strong> specified.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  the cost of an item is $100 and the <strong>Start 
 markup</strong> is 10%, and the <strong>Markup 
 step</strong> is 2%, the price of the item is first computed on the starting  mark - up of 10 %. The <strong>Profit Breakup</strong> browser displays the selling price as $110 with a profit of $10.  The next sale price will be $112 with a profit of $12 and so on.</p>

<p class="note">The mark up on cost is computed per sales measure of  the item.</p>
