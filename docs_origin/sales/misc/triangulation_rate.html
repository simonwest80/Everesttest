<p><strong>Triangulation Rate</strong></p>

<p>One EMU currency cannot be directly converted to another EMU i.e. by  applying the exchange rate between the two EMU currencies. The amount  of the first EMU currency has to be converted to the Euro  and the amount in Euro  converted to the second EMU currency. This process is known as Triangulation.  Triangulation rate is the rate used to make conversions between two EMU  currencies via an intermediate amount in Euro.</p>
