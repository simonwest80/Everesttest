<p>Enter the amount that you receive from the customer. By default, the  balance amount receivable on the document displays.</p>

<p>You can receive on a sales order or sales invoice an amount greater  than the value of the sales order or invoice. In this case, the Overpayment  dialog box appears. The Overpayment dialog box offers several options  for the overpaid amount. You may return it to the customer, apply the  overpayment as a deposit towards future sales to this customer, or leave  the amount as a negative balance on the sales order.</p>
