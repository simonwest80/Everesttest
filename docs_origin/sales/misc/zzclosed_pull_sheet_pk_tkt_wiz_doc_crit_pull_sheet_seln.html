<p>Select this option to view a closed pull sheet.</p>

<p>A ‘Closed’ pull sheet is one on which all the ordered items have been  committed. Pull sheets can also be marked as ‘closed’ manually. A closed  pull sheet can merely be printed or processed to an invoice.</p>

<p>The drop-down button beside this field allows you to specify the pull  sheet number. It is mandatory to specify the pull sheet number if you  select the <strong>Closed Pull Sheet</strong> option.</p>

<p class="note">Items  CANNOT be committed on a closed pull sheet. You can print pick tickets  for pull sheets that have already been created by selecting the <strong>Closed Pull Sheet</strong> option.</p>

<p>If another user has opened an exiting pull sheet, it  is locked so that other users cannot modify it at the same time. When  you select the <strong>Open Pull Sheet</strong> or  <strong>Closed Pull Sheet</strong> option in such  a case, <strong>Everest</strong> informs you that  the pull sheet has been locked by another user and can be opened only  for viewing. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to view  the pull sheet.</p>
