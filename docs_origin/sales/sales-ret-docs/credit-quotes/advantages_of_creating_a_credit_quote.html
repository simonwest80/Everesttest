<h1 id="advantages---creating-a-credit-quote">Advantages - Creating a Credit Quote</h1>

<p>Although you can create a credit order without creating a credit quote,  there are certain advantages in creating a quote:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Record 
 customer negotiations</strong> - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage 
 customer contacts</strong> - It helps to easily retrieve the details of  the quote during negotiations with the customer. The contact manager feature  in <strong>Everest</strong> allows you to associate  tasks and appointments, incoming and outgoing calls, with a specified  quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimize data entry while creating credit orders</strong>  - When a credit quote is converted to an order, the information in the  credit quote flows into the credit order, thus, reducing data entry for  order creation.</li>
  <li><strong>RMA 
 number</strong> - It is the basis for issuing an RMA  number to the customer.</li>
</ul>
