<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to compute  freight using the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/freight-est/everest-freight-estimator/everest_freight_estimator.html">Everest Freight  Estimator</a> if you select the <strong>Include 
 in Freight Calculation</strong> option in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales</strong>  tab).</p>

<p class="note">Freight may be included in a credit memo even after  it has been created and saved. However, a credit memo whose journal has  been posted cannot be modified.</p>
