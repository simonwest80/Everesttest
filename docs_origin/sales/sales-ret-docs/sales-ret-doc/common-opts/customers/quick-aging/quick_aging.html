<p>The <strong>Quick Aging</strong> option (path:  <strong>Sales Return Document</strong> profile  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Customer</strong><strong>&gt; Quick Aging</strong>) brings up the  <strong>Customer Aging Information</strong> browser  for sales return documents that have outstanding payments or deposits.  All outstanding documents are grouped by their document type.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> Outstanding  credit memos and its aliases are grouped under credit memos.</p>

<p>Deposits outstanding on sales orders or amounts outstanding on credit  memos are shown as negative amounts.</p>

<p>An aging analysis is displayed for the outstanding amounts based on  the total days outstanding. The number of days for which a document is  outstanding is calculated from the document’s due date.</p>

<p>The available credit is checked against the effective balance and the  customer is put on automatic hold, if the effective balance is over the  credit limit.</p>

<p>Effective Balance = Net Balance (in customer currency) + Amount of deposit  available on system sales orders with “Prepay” and “COD”  terms (in customer currency).</p>

<p>Available Credit = Credit Limit - Effective Balance</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> The  amount outstanding against a sales invoice is reduced from the available  credit limit even if the document has not been posted.</p>

<p>In case of foreign currency customers, all amounts are displayed in  the customer’s currency even if the deposit on a sales order is received  in a different currency.</p>
