  <dd>Foreign Currency Amount * (Exchange Rate/Quote Amount)</dd>

  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  your base currency is the US Dollar, and the document currency is Great  Britain Pounds (GBP),  and the rate is expressed as 1 GBP  = 1.42064; then 1000 GBP  is translated using the formula for quote type foreign to base as 1000*  (1.42064/1) = 1420.64.</dd>
  <dd>If the rate is expressed as 1 USD  = 0.703973 GBP,  then 1000 GBP  is translated using the formula for quote type base to foreign as 1000*  (1/0.703973) = 1420.64.</dd>
