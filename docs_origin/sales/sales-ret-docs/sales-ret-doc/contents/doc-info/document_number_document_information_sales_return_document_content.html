<p>The <strong>Document #</strong> field displays  the number assigned to a sales return document when it is created. Sequence  numbers for sales return documents are set in the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window &gt; Invoicing</strong>  tab<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">), of t</font>he logged in location/sub-location  from which you create the sales return document.</p>

<p>If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or sub-location,  then the sequence number assigned to the default location specified in  the <strong>Default Location</strong> field (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong>) is assigned to the  document.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> automatically assigns  the next consecutive number to the sales return document created subsequently.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If 1200 is the next number  in sequence for credit quotes for the login location/sub-location ‘Mail  Order’, then  1200 is assigned to a new credit quote created for the location/sub-location  ‘Mail Order’.</p>

<p>If a credit quote is converted to an order or an order is converted  to a memo, and the login <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">location</font> is changed  before saving the order or memo, then the sequence number set for the  logged in <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">location</font> is used at the time of creating  the order or memo (although this is different from the location for the  original quote or order).</p>

<p><strong>Numbering 
 for Document Aliases</strong></p>

<p>Document numbers are assigned continuously. Documents using a different  alias are not assigned a different sequence number.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If you create a credit  quote with the number 1000 and the next credit quote created has an alias  ‘Return of Spares’, the document number for the ‘Return of Spares’ would  be 1001.</p>

<p>Manual Numbering</p>

<p>You cannot number the documents manually  in <strong>Everest</strong>. You can however change  the sequence number by altering it from the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Location/Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoicing</strong>  tab). Every time you change a sequence number, <strong>Everest</strong>  allots the next number in sequence to the documents, thereafter.</p>

<p class="note">Sequence numbers once assigned will not be re-assigned  by <strong>Everest</strong> even if the document  has been discontinued or purged.</p>
