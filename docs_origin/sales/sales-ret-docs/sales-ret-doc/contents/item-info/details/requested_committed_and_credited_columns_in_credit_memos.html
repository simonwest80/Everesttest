  <dt><strong>Requested Column</strong></dt>
  <dd>When a credit order is converted to a credit memo  the <strong>Requested</strong> column displays  the quantity that was on order and not returned at the time of creating  the credit memo. When you create a new credit memo this column defaults  to 1 with the decimal accuracy of the unit of measure. You can increase  the decimal accuracy up to 6 places.</dd>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  300 units of an item were on order, and the quantities are returned in  2 lots of 100 and 200, the first credit memo would display 300 as the  quantity ordered and the second credit memo would display 200 as the quantity  ordered.</p>

<p>This column is in the decimal accuracy of the unit of measure. You can  increase the decimal accuracy up to six places.</p>
