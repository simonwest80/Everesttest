<p>The following back-end processes occur when a credit order is converted  to a credit memo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the ‘credited’  quantity is less than the ‘requested’ quantity, the credit order is assigned  the status of ‘Backorder’.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If the ‘requested’  quantity is returned, the credit order is assigned the status ‘Closed’.  To view closed credit orders, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Received Credit Orders</strong> from the <strong>Credit 
 Orders</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ‘committed’  quantity is received, the stock status of the item displays the following  changes:</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Status of the item</strong> – The quantity ‘On Credit’ for the item reduces  by the quantity received. The total and available quantity of the item  increases.</li>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Status in the committed stock area</strong> - If the committed quantity  is returned, the available out, free out and on credit stock of the item  reduces by the quantity returned.</li>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Status in the assigned stock area</strong> - The total stock and the free  stock increases by the quantity returned.</li>
</ul>
