<p>The accounting entries for returns are entered in a <strong>Sales 
 Journal</strong> that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the journal group selected in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> of the user entering  the sales return.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location as the logged in location or sub-location  of the user creating the credit memo.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same account for Accounts Receivable Control as the current  Accounts Receivable Control account selected in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Control Accounts</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such <strong>open</strong> journal exists,  a new sales journal is created. The sales journal number for the new journal  is taken from the sequence number specified for sales journals in the  logged in location or sub-location.</p>
