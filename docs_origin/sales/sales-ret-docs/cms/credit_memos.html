<h1 id="credit-memos">Credit Memos</h1>

<p>A credit memo (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong>  &gt; <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Memos</strong><strong>&gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>)  is created to account for the items or services returned. The credit memo  in <strong>Everest,</strong> thus, serves a dual  purpose:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recording 
 return of items</strong> - The credit memo acts a ‘Goods Received Note’  as items are taken into inventory only after their return is recorded  on the credit memo.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounting 
 for Sales returns</strong> - The credit memo is the base document for accounting  the amount of sales returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>A credit memo is required to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter returns  against a credit order.</li>
  <li>Record the  returned items and quantities for inventory purpose.</li>
  <li>Automatically  account for the loss or profit on return.</li>
</ul>
