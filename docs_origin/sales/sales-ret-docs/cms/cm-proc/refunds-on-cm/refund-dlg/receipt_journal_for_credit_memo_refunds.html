<p>The accounting entries for refunds on credit memos are entered in a  <strong>Receipt Journal</strong> that fulfills  the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A journal with  the accounting period corresponding to the login date.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings.</strong></li>
  <li>A journal with  the same location as the logged in location or sub-location.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the description ‘Receipt Journal’.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same bank account as the one specified for the payment method.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such open journal exists, a new receipt journal is created. The  number for the new journal is taken from the sequence numbers specified  for Receipt Journals in the logged in location or sub-location.</p>
