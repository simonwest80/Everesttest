<p>Payments may be made against a credit memo in one of the two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making a payment  to the customer.</li>
  <li>Applying the  amount of the credit memo to a sales order as a deposit or an existing  sales invoice for payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Foreign Exchange Information</p>

<p>If you apply a credit memo against a sales order, the system does not  calculate foreign exchange gains or losses. Instead, the system applies  the balance of the credit memo to the sales order. If you make a payment  to a customer to settle a credit memo, the system calculates a foreign  exchange gain or loss and creates an accounting entry of Gain/Loss to  reflect the difference in exchange rate.</p>

<p>If you have set a default account in EITHER the <strong>G/L 
 account for gain on settlement for foreign currency documents</strong> field  OR the <strong>G/L 
 account for loss on settlement for foreign currency documents</strong> field,  it can be used for both gains and losses.</p>

<p>Refunds to customers from a credit memo can be made through a credit  card. A credit card payment is  processed  when you select the <strong>Use Payment Processor</strong>  option in the <strong>Payment Method</strong> profile  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt;</strong><strong>Credit Card Processing</strong> tab).</p>

<p class="steps">To make refunds on a credit memo, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Memo</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Refund</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/refunds/dlg/the_payment_dialog_box_refund_cm.html"><strong>Refund</strong> dialog box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Refund</strong> option  is enabled only when the refund is NOT made on the credit memo. On a new  credit memo the option is available when the credit memo is saved.</p>
