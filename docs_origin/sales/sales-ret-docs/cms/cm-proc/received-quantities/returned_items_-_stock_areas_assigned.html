<h1 id="returned-items---stock-areas-assigned">Returned Items - Stock Areas Assigned</h1>

<p>Inventoried items are assigned to a <strong>Stock</strong>  type of stock area when goods are returned. This process depends on two  factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether the  credit memo is newly created.</li>
  <li>Whether the  credit memo is converted from a credit order.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On a New Credit Memo</strong></p>

<p>Based on the type of item, and the <strong>‘Use 
 default out stock area to assign quantity for non-serialized items in 
 credit order or credit memo’</strong> AND <strong>‘Use 
 default stock area to receive items when creating a new credit memo’</strong> <strong>** options (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Locations/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Miscellaneous</strong>  tab), the <strong>Attach Quantity</strong> and  <strong>Assign</strong> <strong>Quantity</strong>  profiles are/are not displayed. You can first attach quantity from an  <strong>Out</strong> type of stock area from the  <strong>Attach</strong> <strong>Quantity</strong>  profile. Then, you can assign committed quantities to a <strong>Stock</strong> type of stock area from the <strong>Assign 
 Quantity</strong> profile.</p>

<p>When a Credit Order has been converted to a Credit  Memo</p>

<ul>
  <li>When items  are NOT committed at the credit order stage, based on the type of item  and the <strong>‘Use default out stock area 
 to assign quantity for non-serialized items in credit order or credit 
 memo’</strong> option (path: <strong>File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Locations/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab),  the <strong>Assign</strong> <strong>Quantity</strong>  profile is/is not displayed. You can assign quantity to a <strong>Stock</strong>  type of stock area from this profile.</li>
</ul>

 stock area to assign quantity for non-serialized items in credit order

<p>The default stock area to which the items returned on a credit memo  are transferred is determined using the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a default  stock area for transferring items returned on credit memos is specified  in the <strong>Credit Memos</strong> field of the  <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab),  the quantities are transferred to this stock area.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock areas are defined in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box, the items are transferred to the stock area  defined for <strong>Credit Memos</strong> in the  logged in location or sub-location<font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000"> </font>(path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Stock 
 Transfer &gt; Sales Document</strong> tab). If no stock area is defined  for the logged in location or sub-location, the stock area defined for  the default location is used.</li>
</ul>
