<p>Although a credit memo can be directly created when the items are returned,  creating a credit order has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Materials 
 planning</strong> - Creating credit orders helps to track the items on order  and backorder, and the expected dates of return. This influences your  decisions on the materials purchased and helps you plan your repair schedules.</li>
  <li><strong>Returning 
 items for repair or exchange</strong> - You can attach items to a credit  order and move them to a stock area for exchange/repair. When the repaired  item is shipped back to the customer, you can detach the item from the  credit order and close the order.</li>
  <li><strong>Tracking 
 items to be returned</strong> - Items to be returned can be assigned to  a different stock area. This ensures that these items are not sold or  used.</li>
</ul>
