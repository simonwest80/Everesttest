<p>Manual credit orders are created when you create an entry in a receipts  journal crediting the customer with the entry type ‘Miscellaneous Deposit’.  The document number is auto-generated and prefixed with ‘<strong>M</strong>’  denoting that it is a manual credit order. The sequence number for manual  credit orders specified in the login location/sub-location is used. If  the location’s sequence number is blank, the sequence number for the default  location is used.</p>

<p>You can make modifications from within the manual credit order profile  and convert credit orders to credit memos in the same manner as system  documents.</p>
