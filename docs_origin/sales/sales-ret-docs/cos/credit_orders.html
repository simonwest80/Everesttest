<p>A credit order (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong>  &gt; <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Orders</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>) is the second  step in the sales return cycle and follows the initial complaint made  by a customer. A credit order is created after you agree to accept the  returns and issue a Return Merchandize  Authorization (RMA).</p>

<p>Creating a credit order has the following uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It serves as  an authorization to receive returned items and credit the customer.</li>
  <li>It maintains  the history of credit orders and follows up on returns.</li>
  <li>It accepts  returned items from customers for exchange or repair.</li>
  <li>It refunds  customers.</li>
  <li>It manages  tasks through the contact manager feature.</li>
</ul>
