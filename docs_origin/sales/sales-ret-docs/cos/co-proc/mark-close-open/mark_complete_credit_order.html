<p>A credit order is closed either when all items on the order are received  completely or when you mark it closed. You can mark an order closed even  if the order contains line items with committed quantities.</p>

<p>Closed credit orders are displayed only in the <strong>Received 
 Credit Orders</strong> browser. The status of a credit order is displayed  in the lower section of the <strong>Credit Order</strong>  profile.</p>

<p class="steps">To mark a credit order close, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Order</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Process &gt; Mark Close/Open</strong>. The credit order will be marked  as ‘Closed’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you close an ‘open’ credit order, the following  changes take place:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The requested  quantity is reduced to zero.</li>
  <li>The committed  quantity, if any, is detached.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you close a ‘backorder’, the following changes  take place:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The requested  quantity is reduced to the quantity credited (on partially credited quantities).</li>
  <li>The committed  quantity, if any, is detached.</li>
</ul>
