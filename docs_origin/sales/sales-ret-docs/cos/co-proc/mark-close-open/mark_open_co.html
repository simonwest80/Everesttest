<p><strong>Use the **Mark 
 Open</strong> option to re-open a closed order.**</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You close an order when the  customer informs you that the items would no longer be returned to you.  At a later stage, if the customer wants to return the item, you would  open the order.</p>

<p><strong>You may change the status of a closed credit  order to “open” by increasing the quantity requested or adding  new items on the order, though it is not mandatory.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you try to save a closed credit order  after adding a new item or increasing the requested quantity, **Everest</strong>  prompts you of the same. If you click <strong>YES,</strong>  the order status changes to “Backorder” if there are partially  credited quantities or to “Open” if the quantity credited is  zero. If you click <strong>NO,</strong> the status  remains open and changes are not saved.**</p>

<p><strong>If you try to re-open a credit order without  adding new line items or increasing the requested quantity, you do not  get any message.</strong></p>

<p class="note">If you save an order after modification/addition of  inline notes or extended notes, the order status remains closed.  You  need to select the <strong>Mark Open</strong> option  to re-open the order.</p>

<p class="steps">To mark an order open, you must do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Orders</strong> browser, select <strong>Options &gt; Received Credit Orders.</strong> You  will see the <strong>Received Credit Orders</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  required document and select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>. You will see the <strong>Credit 
 Order</strong> profile.</li>
  <li>Add the item  that is being returned if the item does not exist on the order.</li>
  <li>If the item  to be returned exists on the credit order, increase the requested quantity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When items are added to the credit order  and the document is saved, the status of the order changes to ‘Open’.</strong></p>
