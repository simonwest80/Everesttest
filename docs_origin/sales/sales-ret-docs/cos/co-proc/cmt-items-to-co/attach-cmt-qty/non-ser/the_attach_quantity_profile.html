<p>The <strong>Attach Quantity</strong> dialog box <em>**</em> enables you to commit or detach inventoried  items on a sales order/invoice or credit order/memo. You can also specify  the quantity to be shipped in this dialog box. The dialog box comprises  two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item Information  section</li>
  <li>Stock Bins  section</li>
</ul>

</dl>

<p class="note">If the preference option is set to <strong>Allow

Also changing the view  option from <strong>Specific location</strong>  to <strong>All location</strong> will require the  existing security right.</p>

<p>If you have the rights to change the view and  you  have attached the quantity in <strong>Attach 
 Quantity</strong> dialog box before changing the view from <strong>Specific 
 location</strong> to <strong>All locations</strong>  you will still be able to view the quantity attached.</p>

<p>You have attached the quantity in <strong>Attach 
 Quantity</strong> dialog box before changing the view from <strong>All 
 Locations</strong> to <strong>Specific Location</strong>  or from one specific location to another specific location.  Later  when you change the view a warning message will appear. Click <strong>Yes</strong>  to clear the quantity attached or click <strong>No</strong>  to retain the location.</p>

<p>Only items from stock bins that belong to the logged in location are  available for selection, if the option <strong>Allow 
 users to access stock bins of - Logged in Location</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other Flow Control</strong>  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab) is selected.  You will need adequate security rights to attach items from stock bins  belonging to any other location.</p>
