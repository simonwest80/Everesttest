<p>You can enter notes that help users to record any relevant details and make it available for other users as well. A timer is automatically invoked to record the number of minutes and seconds for the duration of the call.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If a technician is assigned the task of assessing the extent of work required on a repair job, the technician can record the details of his findings as notes - the technicians who are actually going to do the repair can, refer to these notes.</p>

<p>All general notes can be viewed or discontinued from the <strong>Contact Manager</strong> profile, <strong>My Tasks</strong> or <strong>All Tasks</strong> browser. General notes are added to the above browsers/profile and this icon <img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/note.gif" alt="" /> is displayed besides them. Users can group by task to see the list of tasks, calls and notes.</p>
