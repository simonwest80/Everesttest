<p>The <strong>Everest Contact Manager</strong> tool  integrates <strong>Contact Management</strong> with  your business automation systems. Although there are several Contact Management  applications available; the advantages of using the <strong>Everest 
 Contact Manager</strong> are listed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The contact  and address information of customers and vendors need not be replicated.  You can use the <strong>Everest</strong> database  without having to track changes of addresses, telephone numbers and other  information in different databases, separately.
    <ul>
      <li>Tasks and appointments  can be associated with relevant business information in the form of documents,  vendors and customers as it helps in easy retrieval of information.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  can assign a task to a sales person for a sales quote. The sales person  can view the sales quote and other customer related information when performing  a task.</p>

<ol>
  <li>By assigning  tasks to documents, you can ensure no task is overlooked.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" />  As  and when a sales quote is created, you can assign a task to the sales  person to follow up with the customer at periodic intervals.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tasks and appointments  can be scheduled and viewed from all documents such as sales and purchase  documents.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You can view all pending tasks for a sales order from within  it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tasks can be  assigned to multiple users with reference to customer or vendor documents.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" /> When creating  a sales order, you can create separate tasks for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Warehouse In Charge</strong> - Keep the item  ready for shipment.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Clerk</strong> - Date of delivery of  the item.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing Clerk</strong> - Create a sales invoice  for the item delivered.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Multimedia  files containing additional information can be attached to a task or an  appointment.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" /> A document with price comparison of similar items can be  attached to a task for vendor negotiations on a document. A copy of a  customer’s complaint can be attached to a customer service task.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>Contact 
 Manager</strong> can be used as an effective communication tool within the  company.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/example.gif" alt="" /> Any new sales policy can be communicated to the entire sales  team by assigning a task of reviewing the policy and attaching the policy  to a task.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If your users  belong to different time zones, you can set tasks in the user’s time zone.</li>
</ol>
