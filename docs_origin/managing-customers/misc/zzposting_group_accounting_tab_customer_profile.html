<p>Select a Posting Group to associate the customer with. For new customers,  by default this field is populated with the Posting Group that is defined  for the customer’s location. The location is considered based on the sub-location  selected in the customer profile. If no sub-location has been selected  in the customer profile, then it will default to the Posting Group defined  for the logged-in-location. You can however assign a different Posting  Group to the customer in the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile.</p>

<p>For existing customers, this field is blank, indicating that the Posting  Group for the customer class to which the customer belongs would be considered.  To override the Posting Group of the customer class, select a Posting  Group in this field.</p>
