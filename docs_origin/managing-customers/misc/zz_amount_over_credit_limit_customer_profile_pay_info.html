<p>Select this box to put the customer on hold if the amount due from the  customer exceeds the credit limit plus the amount over credit limit. Enter  the amount over credit limit applicable to the customer in the box provided.</p>

<p>The amount due from the customer includes both posted and unposted amounts.</p>

<p class="example">If the customer’s credit limit is $5,000 and  the amount over credit limit is $3,000, the customer is put on hold automatically  if the current balance exceeds $8,000. If the customer pays the balance  down to below $6,000 after the automatic credit hold is placed and the  <strong>Remove automated customer on hold automatically</strong>  option in the <strong>Other Flow Control</strong>  dialog box is selected (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>  tab), the system automatically removes the credit hold since the balance  is less than $8,000 after the payment.</p>
