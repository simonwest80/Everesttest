<p>The <strong>On credit hold</strong> check box  displays the credit hold status of the customer. This check box will be  checked if you have put the customer on credit hold.</p>

<p>This check box is checked by default, if the <strong>On 
 credit hold</strong> check box in the <strong>Customer</strong> profile is selected (path: <strong>Invoicing 
 &gt; Customers &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment information tab</strong>).</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/note.gif" alt="" />  You  cannot modify the credit hold status from here. You can change it manually  from the **Customer</strong> profile.**</p>
