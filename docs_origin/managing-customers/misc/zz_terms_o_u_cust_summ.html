<p>The average number of days over the due date, taken by the customer  to completely pay an invoice is calculated using the following formula:</p>

<p>Average number of days over due date = Sum of (Fully Paid Date - Due  Date) for all PAID invoices /Number of PAID invoices.</p>

<p>The fully paid date is the date on which the balance due becomes Nil.</p>
