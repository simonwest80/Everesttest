<p>The due date for payment is computed based on the payment terms. Check  this box to put the customer on automatic hold if payment is not received  even after the expiry  of the additional number of days (also called days past due) specified  here.</p>

<p>Specify the number of days from the payment date in the box provided.</p>

<p class="example">If the <strong>Number 
 of days past due</strong> is 15 days, the customer is put on hold automatically  after 15 days. If the customer makes the required payments according to  the payment terms after the automatic credit hold is placed and the <strong>Remove automated customer on hold automatically</strong>  option in the Other  Flow Control dialog box is selected (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong>  tab), the system automatically removes the credit hold since the account  is current.</p>
