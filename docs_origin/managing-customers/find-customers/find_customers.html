<p>The <strong>Find Customers</strong> function  facilitates you to search for customers as per specific criteria that  you define.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you have a huge customer base and want information on a specific set of  customers, such as customers who belong to a particular location/sub-location,  use the <strong>Find Customer</strong> function.</p>

<p>You can choose the search parameters individually or in combination  with any of the other parameters to narrow down the search. You can create  as many filters as necessary with varying parameters and store them in  <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>The search results help you perform various functions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quick aging</li>
  <li>View documents  associated with customers</li>
  <li>View the transaction  history</li>
  <li>Send e-mails  and faxes</li>
</ul>

<p>The results of your search are displayed in the <strong>Customers</strong> browser. You can  further filter the records by using the <strong>My 
 Customers</strong> or <strong>All Customers</strong>  option from the <strong>View</strong> menu.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You may  select multiple customers in the <strong>Account 
 Code</strong> field. If you use that selection in conjunction with the <strong>My Customers</strong> option, <strong>Everest</strong>  displays only those customers that are assigned to you.</p>

<p>If you want to search  for customers in a particular city, select the specific city</p>

<p>(<strong>More 
 Choices</strong> tab &gt; <strong>City</strong>),  and combine it with the <strong>All Customers</strong>  option; all the customers of your company who belong to that city are  displayed.</p>
