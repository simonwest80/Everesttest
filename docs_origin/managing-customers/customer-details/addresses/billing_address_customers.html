<h1 id="billing-address">Billing Address</h1>

<p>The address to which the customer’s invoice is sent is the billing address  of the customer. The billing address is specified in the <strong>Customer</strong> profile <strong>- General</strong> tab.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>If the customer’s billing address is used  when creating final documents (such as sales invoices or credit memos),  you can modify the billing address by using the ‘</strong>Modify 
 Address<strong>’  option in the **Customer</strong> profile.**</p>

<p><strong>When you modify a customer’s billing address,  **Everest</strong> allows you to:**</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the customer.</li>
  <li>Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.</li>
</ul>

<p>A customer can have only one billing address but may have any number  of shipping and contact addresses. The customer can log into your <strong>Everest</strong> online store using the customer  code, or the e-mail ID specified in the billing or contact address.</p>
