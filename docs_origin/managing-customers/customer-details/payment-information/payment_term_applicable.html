<p>The payment term that applies to the customer is the basis for calculating  the due date for payments on sales, and cash discounts for prompt payments.  A payment term must be selected (in the <strong>Term</strong> field) only if the customer is allowed to make purchases on account.  Only ‘on account’  type of payment terms are available for selection.</p>

<p>The <strong>Terms</strong> selected in the <strong>Customers</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Customers</strong>)  is displayed, by default, in the <strong>Terms</strong>  field of the <strong>Customer</strong> profile  (path: <strong>Customer</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Information</strong>  tab).</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/note.gif" alt="" />  You  can modify the payment terms for specific customers anytime from the <strong>Customer</strong> profile, to override the defaults.  A user with adequate security rights can also modify the terms at the  document level.</p>

<p>When you create a document for the customer, the payment terms defined  in the <strong>Payment Terms</strong> field of  the <strong>Customer</strong> profile (path: <strong>Customer</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Payment 
 Information</strong> tab) is displayed, by default, in the <strong>Terms</strong> field (of the document profile).</p>
