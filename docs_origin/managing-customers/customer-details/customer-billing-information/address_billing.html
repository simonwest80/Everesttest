<p>The address of the customer is the billing address. It is the address  to which you send invoices. A customer can have only one billing address,  but may have any number of return and contact addresses.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>If the customer’s billing address is used  when creating final documents (such as sales invoices or credit memos),  you can modify the billing address by using the ‘</strong>Modify 
 Address<strong>’  option in the **Customer</strong> profile.**</p>

<p><strong>When you modify a customer’s billing address,  **Everest</strong> allows you to:**</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the customer.</li>
  <li>Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.</li>
</ul>
