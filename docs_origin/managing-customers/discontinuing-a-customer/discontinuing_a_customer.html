<p>When you discontinue a record it is not deleted from the database; it  is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available for  selection by activating it.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/note.gif" alt="" />  You  can discontinue a customer only if the customer’s net balance is zero.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong>  informs you if the customer you are discontinuing has open orders. If  you discontinue such a customer, you cannot accept deposits against the  sales order, or convert the sales order to a sales invoice.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a customer, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customers</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Customers</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Customers</strong> browser, highlight the customer  record to be discontinued.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Discontinue</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The selected record is no longer  visible in the <strong>Customers</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
