<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to hide sensitive  cost information during the stock transfers by masking the amount columns  in the <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> browser <strong>** and **Stock Transfer</strong> document.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> You may not want to disclose  cost information to certain people who work with your data.</p>

<p>This can be done by setting the preferences in the work station settings  and flow control preferences.</p>

<p>Preference Settings in the Work Station Setting dialog  box</p>

<p>Clear the <strong>Enable Extended Mode</strong> option  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Work Station Settings</strong> dialog box &gt; <strong>Company 
 Settings</strong> tab).</p>

<p>Preference Settings in the Other Flow Control dialog  box:</p>

<p>In the <strong>Type of cost to be displayed 
 in Inventory browsers, Stock Transfer and Pricing Analysis</strong> field,  (path: <strong>File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control</strong> dialog box &gt; <strong>Item Cost/Sales Summary</strong> tab) select  <strong>NONE</strong>.</p>

<p>If the above preferences are set, you will see the <strong>Stock 
 Transfer Amount</strong> column in the <strong>Stock 
 Transfer</strong> browser masked with ****. The same masking occurs in the  <strong>Amount</strong> column in the <strong>Grid 
 Information</strong> section and <strong>Total</strong> field in the <strong>Results</strong> section  of the <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> document.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/note.gif" alt="" /> You must  have adequate security rights to enable/disable extended mode. Ensure  that security rights are not assigned to users from whom you want to mask  the costs.</p>
