<h1 id="the-retrieve-serial-numbers-dialog-box">The Retrieve Serial Numbers Dialog Box</h1>

<p>The <strong>Retrieve Serial Numbers</strong>  dialog box allows you to scan the system serial numbers or manufacturer’s  serial numbers for serialized and auto-serialized items. You can either  scan the serial numbers using a bar code scanner or manually type the  serial numbers.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Physical Bin</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select a bin from the drop-down for which you are  attaching serial numbers. When you scan or enter a serial number, it is  attached to the bin selected in this field. As a result, the physical  quantity for the matching line item is incremented.</dd>
  <dd>Here’s an overview of how situations involving a  mismatch are dealt with.</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>If you scan  an item that is not present in the bin selected in the <strong>Physical 
 Bin</strong> field, <strong>Everest</strong> asks  if you would like to include the item in the bin.</li>
  <li>If the scanned  item is not present in the document, but belongs to the physical count  bin, you are asked if you want to add the item to the document.</li>
  <li>If the scanned  item does not belong to the location of the <strong>Stock 
 Count</strong> profile, the scanned serial number is ignored. Only items  found in the location of the document are considered for the counting  process.</li>
</ul>

<p>: The effect of leaving this field blank is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is an  increment in the quantity if the item code of the line item matches the  item code of the serial number scanned.</li>
  <li>If the item  code of the line item does not match the item code of the serial number  scanned, <strong>Everest</strong> looks for the  matching code in the same bin. There is an increment in the quantity if  a similar item code is found; if not, Everest asks if you would like to  add that item code as a separate line item.</li>
</ul>

<p>Method</p>

<p>This section allows you to specify the method of retrieval of the serial  numbers.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Serial Number</strong></dt>
  <dd>Based on the method you select for retrieval of  serial numbers, scan the individual serial numbers, range of serial numbers  or manufacturer’s serial numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="note">
  <li>Serial numbers  of a physical count may not be available in any of the bins of the location  specified in the Stock Count profile. In this case, you cannot include  these numbers for a physical count in this stock count document. You must  first transfer these serial numbers to the location of the Stock Count  profile through a Stock Transfer document.</li>
  <li>If the scanned  serial number does not exist in the system, it must be brought into the  system through a credit memo before scanning it.</li>
</ul>
