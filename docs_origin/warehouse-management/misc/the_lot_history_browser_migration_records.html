<p>Migration Records in the Lot History Browser</p>

<p>If you have upgraded from a previous version of <strong>Everest</strong>,  the <strong>Lot History</strong> browser will only  display the stock quantity of the Lot as on the date of upgrade with the  transaction type as ‘Opening Balance’.</p>

<p>The following record is created on migration for all lot tracked items:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Field</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Document Date</td>
      <td>Date of Migration</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quantity in Stock</td>
      <td>Stock for the Lot as on Date</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stock UM</td>
      <td>Stock Unit of Measure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transaction Type</td>
      <td>Displays the Transaction Type ‘Opening Balance’</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This record appears as a line in the <strong>Lot 
 History</strong> browser.</p>

<p class="example">Item A is created and lot tracked using version  2.1.  Item  A has 10 units in Lot 1234 and 20 units in Lot 4321.  After  the migration to version 3.0, the <strong>Lot 
 History</strong> browser for Lot 1234 displays an opening balance of 10  and the <strong>Lot History</strong> browser for  Lot 4321 displays an opening balance of 20. These opening balances are  the initial balances of the two lots in version 3.0.</p>
