  <dd>This field identifies the location or sub-location  for which the document is being created. It is the location or sub-location  that initiates the stock transfer. When a new stock transfer is created,  the <strong>loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field displays  the login location/sub-location,  but a different location or sub-location can be specified for the document.</dd>
  <dd>By assigning a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of stock transfers by sub-location and print reports  for your management information purposes.</dd>
