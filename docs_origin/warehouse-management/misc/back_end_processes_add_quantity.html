<p>Following are the back end processes that take place, when you add a  quantity of items to a stock:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The inventory  value of the item increases.</li>
  <li>The average  cost of the item changes. The new average cost is calculated by dividing  the new inventory value by the quantity in stock.</li>
  <li>If the item  is serialized, serial numbers are generated for the added quantity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stock status of the item shows the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Status for the item</strong> - There is an increase in total stock and available  stock of the item.</li>
  <li><strong>Stock 
 Status in the stock area</strong> - There is an increase in the quantity  of items available in the stock area to which the item has been assigned.  The total stock of the item in the assigned stock area increases.</li>
</ul>
