<p>You can search for serial numbers using the purchase cost of the item.  It is the cost as per the purchase document per measure of the item.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> The purchase measure is a dozen and the number of units of  the item is 10 in the purchase document and the total amount (including  tax and excluding discount) is $2400. The purchase cost of each serial  unit of the item would therefore be computed as below:</p>

<p>$2400 / (10*12)</p>

<p><strong>10 is the number of units and 1 dozen (12  units) is the purchase measure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thus, the purchase cost per serial unit  of the item is $20.</strong></p>

<p>The purchase cost selected in this parameter is always represented in  base currency for the purpose of the search.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  you have purchased the item in Australian dollars and the base currency  is US Dollar, the purchase cost selected for the parameter should be in  US dollars and not Australian dollars.</p>
