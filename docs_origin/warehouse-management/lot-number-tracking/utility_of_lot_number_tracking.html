<ul>
  <li>They are required  during manufacture to maintain quality control records. The quality control  department checks the number of defectives per lot and whether the defectives  are within reasonable limits.</li>
  <li>They are required  during purchase for the inspection of consignments received. All quantities  in a lot are approved or rejected based on sample items of the lot.</li>
  <li>They are required  to make vendor returns. If defects are reported from quantities in a lot,  you might decide to return all quantities of stock in that lot.</li>
  <li>They are required  to track expiry  dates for perishable commodities. The expiry  date of perishable commodities has to be recorded against the lot number.</li>
