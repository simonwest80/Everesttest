<h1 id="the--lot-history-browser"> The  Lot History Browser</h1>

<p>The <strong>Lot History</strong> browser shows  the changes in the lot from the time it was initially inventoried. Each  document that pertains to that lot is listed by the creation sequence.  You can easily view purchases, sales, and inventory adjustments made to  the selected lot along with the applicable unit of measure. Document transactions  for a lot that appear in the browser include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase Receipts</li>
  <li>Sales Invoices</li>
  <li>Credit Memos</li>
  <li>Debit Memos</li>
  <li>Quantity Adjustments</li>
  <li>Work Orders</li>
</ul>

<p>Information for each document includes both the document unit of measure  and the stock unit of measure making it easier to compare and reconcile  this information with your actual records.</p>

<dl class="note">
  <dt>The item must be lot tracked for the details  to display. If an item is not lot tracked for a particular period of time,  the documents created for that lot during this time period will not appear  in the <strong>Lot History</strong> browser. However,  lot details will be available in the **Lot </dt>
  <dt> History** browser if the same lot is used even after you clear the  <strong>Use Lot Tracking</strong> option on the  <strong>Inventory</strong> tab of the <strong>Item</strong>  Profile.</dt>

<p class="example">A product that you purchased and resold has  been recalled by the manufacturer. The lot being recalled is Lot 24 which  is lot tracked. You can select Lot 24 in the <strong>Lots</strong>  browser and open the lot history. Documents that affect the lot are displayed  in the browser and can be opened for viewing. With this information, you  can determine the customers who have bought items in this lot from you  and contact them to return the item.</p>

 &gt; Lots</strong> to display the <strong>Lots</strong>  browser.</li>
