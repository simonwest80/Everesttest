<h1 id="lot-number-tracking">Lot Number Tracking</h1>

<p>Items that are mass-produced are manufactured in lots or batches. Manufacturers  assign unique lot numbers or batch numbers and affix them on all quantities  manufactured in that lot or batch. Lot numbers are generally assigned  to items that are not assigned individual manufacturer’s serial numbers.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> Pharmaceuticals,  food items, or clothing.</p>

<p>Lot numbers may also be assigned to items with serial numbers to identify  the batch in which the item was manufactured.</p>

<p>Lot number tracking involves maintaining the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The batch number  or lot number of manufacture for quantities of an item on purchase or  manufacture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  you buy 25 packs of cola, and 15 packs belong to lot # 2560119 and 10  to lot # 2560120, you would record the lot numbers and quantities received  against each lot.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lot numbers  of quantities sold or utilized.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  6 packs of cola belonging to lot # 2560119 and 5 of lot # 2560120 are  sold, the quantity and lot number details must be recorded against the  sales invoice.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lot  numbers of quantities in stock and their location.</li>
</ul>
