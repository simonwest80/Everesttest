<p>Following are the back end processes that take place, when you make a cost adjustment:</p>

<p>The inventory value of the item increases, if the cost adjustment is positive and reduces, if the cost adjustment is negative.</p>

<p>The average cost of the item changes. The new average cost is calculated by dividing the new inventory value by the quantity in stock.</p>

<p>If the item is serialized, the cost of the serial numbers attached to the document is updated with the new cost.</p>
