  <dt><strong>Inventory Adjustment Account</strong></dt>
  <dd>An accounting entry is made in the general journal  for the inventory adjustment amount. The accounts affected are Inventory  Adjustment account and Inventory Control account. The Inventory Control  Account defined in the Posting Group assigned to the line item is considered  first.</dd>
  <dd>If no Inventory Control Account is defined for the  item, the control account defined for the category to which the line item  belongs is used. If the Inventory Control Account is not defined for either  the item or the category, the Inventory Control Account of the stock area’s  location from where the item is assigned is taken into consideration.  The user may however override this account by selecting another account.  The Inventory Adjustment account can also be selected for each line.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Inventory Adjustment Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>The amount of inventory adjustment on that line  is calculated and displayed. Accounting entries are made for this value.</dd>
  <dd>The amount of inventory adjustment is calculated  using these formulae:</dd>
  <dd>Adjustment amount = (Cost per measure * Quantity  for adjustment)</dd>
  <dd>The computation of amounts depends on the quantity  entry method.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">If the quantity of an item is measured in kilograms,  2 kilograms and a half of the item, at a cost of $2000, would be expressed  as 2:500 under the fractional method. The amount would be calculated as  follows:</p>

<p>2 * $2000 + (500/1000) * $2000</p>

<p>If the quantity is 2 kilograms and 500 grams and the  decimal accuracy is 2, the quantity under the decimal method would be  expressed as 2.50.</p>

<p>The amount would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>2.50*$2000</p>
