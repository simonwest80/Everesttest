  <dt><strong>Stock Bin</strong></dt>
  <dd>The bin that contains the line item is displayed  in this column.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">In case you are retrieving an item directly  in the Item Details Grid, without using any of the <strong>Retrieve</strong><strong>Items</strong> options, you are required  to select a bin in this column. Double click in this column to display  the drop-down arrow. Click the arrow and select the bin for which you  want to conduct the stock count from the browser that is displayed.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Stock Area</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the stock area to which  the line item belongs.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Stock Measure</strong></dt>
  <dd>The unit of measure specified in the <strong>Stock Measure</strong> field of the Item profile  (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Items</strong>  &gt; <strong>Items</strong> <strong>browser</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In

  <dt><strong>System Cost</strong></dt>
  <dd>In case of inventoried items, this column  displays the average cost; for serialized items, it displays the weighted  average of the actual cost of the system serial numbers.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">If you are using the Take Snapshot to Count  method, average cost, at the time of creation of the <strong>Stock 
 Count</strong> profile, may differ from the average cost when the document  is marked as Counted. The <strong>System Cost</strong>  column in the Item Details Grid is automatically updated with the new  cost. This change is also conveyed through a message.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>System Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is calculated as follows:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Inventoried  items: System Stock * Average Cost</li>
  <li>Serialized/Auto-serialized  items: Sum of actual cost of serial numbers</li>
</ul>

<dl>

  <dt><strong>Physical Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is calculated as follows:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Inventoried  items: Physical Stock * Average Cost</li>
  <li>Serialized/Auto-serialized  items: Sum of actual cost of serial numbers</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Adjustment Quantity</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the quantity of variance  by default. The quantity is negative if physical stock is less than the  system stock and positive if the physical stock is more than the system  stock. You can edit the quantity in the following cases:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>The item  is either inventoried or auto-serialized</li>
  <li>The adjusted  quantity is being added</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>: The adjusted quantity should not exceed  the variance quantity of the inventoried item.</dt>
  <dd>For serialized and auto-serialized items,  this column is updated to the quantity of the serial numbers written off  when an inventory adjustment document is created.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Adjustment Cost</strong></dt>
  <dd>By default, this column displays the average  cost of the items used to adjust the quantity of variance. You can edit  this cost in the following cases:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>The item  is either inventoried or auto-serialized.</li>
  <li>The adjusted  quantity is being added.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>: You cannot edit this column if you are writing  off a quantity.</dt>
  <dd>For serialized and auto-serialized items,  this column is updated with the weighted average of the actual cost of  the serial numbers written off when an inventory adjustment document is  created.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Adjustment Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is calculated as the adjustment quantity  multiplied by the adjustment cost.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Variance Quantity</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the difference between  the physical and system stocks.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Variance Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the difference between  the physical and system values.</dd>
