<p>When you transfer stock, the stock status of the ‘from’ and  ‘to’ stock areas shows the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stock area from which  items are transferred - The quantity in Stock and Available columns is  reduced.</li>
  <li>Stock area to which  items are transferred - The quantity in Stock and Available columns is  increased.</li>
  <li>An entry is made  for serial numbers transferred in the Serial number history browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>A company that transfers stock across locations can track  stock that is in transit through the stock transfer profile (Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New 
 Request</strong> &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>  from the <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> profile).</p>

<p>The stock status changes during the three different stages  of stock transfer - Request, In-Transit and Completed.</p>

<p><strong>Stock Transfer - Request stage</strong></p>

<p>Stock that is in Request stage is specified in this profile.  The status of the Available stock during Request stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Requesting location  - Total and Available Stock (No decrease)</li>
  <li>Origin Location  - Total and Available Stock (No increase)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stock Transfer - In-Transit stage</strong></p>

<p>Stock is temporarily transferred to the In-transit bin specified  in the flow control preferences during this stage. (<strong>Locations</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> &gt;  <strong>Inventory Adjustment</strong> &gt; <strong>Stock Transfer Transit State</strong> field).</p>

<p>The status of the Available quantity of stock during In-Transit  stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Origin 
 Location</strong> - Available stock decreases by transferred quantity</li>
  <li><strong>Requesting 
 Location</strong> - No increase due to transfer in Available stock</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stock Transfer - Completed Stage</strong></p>

<p>Stock is again moved from the In-transit bin to the To Bin  of the Requesting Location during this stage. The status of the Available  stock during Completed stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Origin 
 Location</strong> - Total and Available stock decreases by stock transferred  (Available Stock minus Stock Transferred)</li>
  <li><strong>Requesting 
 Location</strong> - Total and Available stock  increases  by stock transferred (Available Stock plus Stock Transferred)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify an In-transit bin for automatically transferring  stock In Transit from the Stock Transfer Transit State drop-down list  in <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location/Sub-Location</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> &gt;  <strong>Inventory Adjustment</strong> tab.</p>
