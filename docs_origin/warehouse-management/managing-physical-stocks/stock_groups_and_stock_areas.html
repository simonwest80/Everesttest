<p>Stock groups and stock areas in <strong>Everest</strong>  extend beyond physical locations. They can be created to represent physical  locations (e.g., Warehouse - New Jersey) or virtual locations (e.g., Stocks-in-transit).  A stock area is a bin in which the items are actually located.</p>

<p>The type of stock area identifies whether the stock type is <strong>Stock</strong>  or <strong>Out</strong> and whether you have ownership  over the stocks in that area. The type <strong>Stock</strong>  denotes that you own the inventory in the stock area. The type <strong>Out</strong>  denotes that the ownership of the inventory vests with another.</p>

<p>Tracking stocks with other entities is required to track your inventories.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> Stocks-in-transit  from vendors or customer returns expected.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to create  multiple levels of stock groups. Thus, stock groups can be created to  represent locations (Virginia, Ohio), warehouses (‘Warehouse 1 - Virginia’),  warehouse areas (‘Floor 2 -Warehouse 1 - Virginia’),  nature of stock in that area (‘Packing Area’),  ownership (‘Customer Returns Expected’,  ‘Items for inspection’)  or a combination of these.</p>
