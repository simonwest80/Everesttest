# Introduction


In any business environment, employees need to constantly interact with  customers and vendors, and regular correspondence is usually carried out  using an e-mail client. You can keep a track of all correspondences with  customers and vendors and link it to **Everest**  through the **Everest MailBridge**  utility.


The **Everest MailBridge** utility  identifies e-mails by matching their e-mail IDs with those specified in  the **Customer** or **Vendor**  address profiles and allows you to link customer e-mails sent from or  received in **Everest**, either as  a task or as an e-mail. Further, **Everest****MailBridge** also identifies e-mails  sent to or received from **Everest**  users in your organization by matching their e-mail IDs those defined  in the User profile.


With **Everest MailBridge**, you  can seamlessly link e-mails in **Everest**.  You can link existing e-mails received at an earlier date, by retrieving  them from the  e-mail  client and adding them to **Everest**  either as “tasks”or “e-mails”. You can also link e-mails you send from  the Inbox of your local mail client to **Everest**.


**Everest MailBridge** allows you  to link the e-mails you send and receive in your Outlook, to **Everest**.
