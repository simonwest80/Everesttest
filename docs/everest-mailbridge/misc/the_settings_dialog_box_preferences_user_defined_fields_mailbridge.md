# The Settings Dialog Box - Preferences - User-defined Fields


The **User-defined Fields** tab  allows you to store basic information about customers (such as the account  code, account name, first name and last name) in the user-defined custom  fields you create in your Outlook. You can store and group e-  mails received from customers (in your local mail client) on the basis  of this information.
