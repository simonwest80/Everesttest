<p>There may be mails that you have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Received at  a date prior to the set up of <strong>Everest 
 MailBridge</strong>. <em>**</em></li>
  <li>Sent to/received  from Outlook,  while not logged on to <strong>Everest MailBridge</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to first retrieve these mails by processing them, before you  can link them to <strong>Everest</strong> as ‘tasks/e-mails’.</p>

<p class="steps">To retrieve e-mails,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once you have  logged on to <strong>Everest MailBridge</strong>,  right-click on the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-mailbridge/img/mailbridge_everest_mailbridge_icon.gif" alt="" /> icon on the status bar of your desktop  and select <strong>Process E-mail</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-mailbridge/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/existing-emails/process-email-wnd/process_e_mail_window_mailbridge.html"><strong>Process E-mail</strong>  window</a>.</li>
  <li>From the left  panel, select the folder that contains the e-mails  you want to retrieve. All the e-mails  are retrieved into the <strong>Process E-mail</strong>window <em>**</em> in the right panel.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-mailbridge/img/mailbridge_cancel_button.gif" alt="" /> button in the status  bar, to stop the process of retrieving e-mails.</p>
