<p>If the item is a product, you can adopt the item’s 12 digit Universal  Product Code number or define your own item code. The UPC  bar codes have 11 digits with a check digit added as the 12th.</p>

<p>Items can have only the UPC  numbers by selecting the <strong>UPC</strong>  option in <strong>Bar Code type</strong> field  in the <strong>Items</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Items &gt; Item Details</strong> tab).</p>

<p>Although defining your own item code helps in easier identification,  using the UPC  number as your item code has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It serves as  a common identifier for both your customers and vendors. You can send  a copy of the purchase order directly to the vendor without having to  change your item code to match the vendor’s item code.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If the UPC  number for an item is 123456789123 and your user-defined item code is  LEVI215, you have to create a new purchase order for the vendor, with  the vendor’s item code.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It helps in  automating your supply chain.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">When you receive items from your vendor with  a UPCbarcode,  you can scan it into your inventory without having to map it to your item  code.</p>
