# Notes


The **Notes** tab is provided in  the **Item** profile to enter additional  information about the item. Additional information can be any information  you would like to convey to the user who is processing a sale or purchase  transaction for a particular item.


Notes can also remind you of tasks that have to be done prior to proceeding  a transaction.


**Extended Purchase/Sales Description**


The notes specified in the **Extended 
 purchase description** and **Extended 
 sales description** sections are printed on purchase and sale documents  respectively.


In these sections, you can define additional information or tags such  as the user code and time that has to be retrieved into documents along  with the item.


{:.example}
If you add %user%  to the **Extended sales description** section,  then when a sales document is being created, the item's extended description  will also show the logged in user name.


This feature is especially useful in the  service industry.


{:.example}
Create a non-inventoried item called "Tech"  and in extended description add the ‘user’ tag. When this item is retrieved  into a sales document the user that the item represents becomes apparent  since the user code of the logged in user is also retrieved.


The tags that can be included are:


| **Tag Name** | **Description** |
| Date | Current login date is retrieved into the document. |
| Time | Current time is retrieved into the document. |
| User | Code of the logged in user is retrieved. |
| Item code | Code of the item is retrieved. |
| Item description | Description of the item is retrieved. |



{:.steps}
To add a tag to the extended purchase description section,  do the following:

- Place the cursor  in the **Extended purchase description** section.
- Select the  required tag from the right-click menu.



Similarly tags can be added to the **Extended 
 sales description** section.
