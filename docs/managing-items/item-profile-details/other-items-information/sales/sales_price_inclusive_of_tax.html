<p>Use the <strong>Tax inclusive selling price</strong>  option to specify that the price of an item as displayed in the <strong>Item Price</strong> column of a sales document  is inclusive of sales tax applicable to the item. When this option is  selected, <strong>Everest</strong> computes the  sales tax for the item and will derive the base selling price. The base  selling price of the item is the price excluding the sales tax applicable.</p>

<p class="example">If an item’s selling price is $110, which is inclusive of 10% sales  tax, the base-selling price that accounts for the revenue is $100.</p>

<p>The purpose of arriving at the base selling price of an item whose price  is inclusive of tax is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To identify  the revenues to be accounted.</li>
  <li>To identify  the amount of tax collected and payable to the Tax Authorities.</li>
  <li>To compute  discount, if any, on the base price rather than on the tax inclusive price.</li>
  <li>To compute  commission payable to sales persons based on the revenues rather than  on the tax inclusive price.</li>
</ul>
