# Commissionable


You can set up each item such that a different rate of commission is  payable to the sales representatives responsible for its sale. This percentage  is specified in the **Sales** tab  of the **Item** profile. The commission  calculated for an item is based on either profit or cost based on preferences  set for the company.
