# Miscellaneous Sales Information


**Pack Separately**
: If this check box is selected, freight is computed  separately for each unit of the item contained on sales and purchase documents.


{:.note}
This field is disabled if the **Item 
 Type** selected in the **General**  tab of the **Item** profile is **Kit**. If this option is selected for  items that make up a kit, only those items will be packed separately.


{:.example}
A sales invoice contains three line items,  A, B and C.  Item A is marked as "pack separately" while items B and C  do not have this option selected. 10 units of Item A and 2 units each  of itemâ€™s B and C  are shipped. The number of packages in this case are 11 (10+1). Freight  is computed for each unit of item A separately.
