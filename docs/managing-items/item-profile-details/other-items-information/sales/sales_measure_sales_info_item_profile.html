<h1 id="sales-measure">Sales Measure</h1>

<p>Sales measures identify the selling quantity of items, which could either  be in formats of a single unit or a number of units.</p>

<p class="example">Hour, inch, foot, yard, pint, quart, gallon,  bushel, ounce, pound, short ton, long ton, each, six-pack, case, dozen,  hundred.</p>

<p>An item, whose sales measure comprises more than one unit, can also  be sold as individual units.</p>

<p>When creating a sales or purchase document for an item, <strong>Everest</strong>  automatically retrieves the item into the document using the sales or  purchase measure defined for the item.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Everest</strong> can handle up to 1/100000  of a decimal place.</p>

<p class="example">Computer chips that sell at $3.50 for a quantity of 100 or $0.035 each.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> calculates the total  cost or price of an item in a purchase or sales order by multiplying the  number in the quantity column by the price and dividing that number by  the Unit Measure.</p>

<p class="example">If you sell an item in 100 pack increments,  at a price of $129.00 per 100 the Unit measure would be 100 &amp;  the selling price would be $129.00. If you sell 2 single units from a  100 pack, <strong>Everest</strong> calculates the  price as (129/100) * 2 = $2.58.</p>
