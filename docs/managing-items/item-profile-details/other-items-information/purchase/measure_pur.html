<p>Measure helps you sell or purchase items in formats other than a single  unit. <strong>Everest</strong> allows you to set  measures for items that are purchased and sold. You can specify a different  measure for the purchase and sale of an item.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>You could purchase computer cable by meter  and sell it by foot or you can buy soft drink cans by cartons and sell  them by the can.</strong></p>
