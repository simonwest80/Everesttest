# Cost Including Tax


Use the **Tax Inclusive Cost** option  to specify that the vendor as displayed in the **Item 
 Price** column of purchase documents quote the cost of the item after  including the sales tax amount.


The tax on purchases may include Recoverable and Non-recoverable taxes.  If this option is selected, the recoverable portion of taxes is reduced  from the item cost (base price) and only includes the non-recoverable  portion.
