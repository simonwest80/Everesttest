<h1 id="quantity-entry-method">Quantity Entry Method</h1>

<p>The <strong>Quantity entry method</strong> for  the item determines how quantities of the item will be entered and with  what precision. <strong>Everest</strong> provides  you with two types of quantity entry methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/misc/fractional.html">Fractional  method</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/misc/decimal.html">Decimal  method</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Value of Stock</strong></p>

<p>The value of stock that is computed when these methods are selected  are illustrated in the following example:</p>

<p class="example">If an  item’s measure is a kilogram, and the measure comprises 1000 grams, 2  kilograms and a half at a cost of $2 would be expressed as 2:500 under  the fractional method. The value of the quantity would be calculated as  follows:</p>

<p>2 * $2 + (500/1000)*$2</p>

<p>If the quantity is 2 kilograms and 500 grams with a decimal accuracy  of 3, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed as 2.500.</p>

<p>The value of the quantity would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>2.500*$2</p>
