# Discontinue/Reactivate an Item Category


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of item categories. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
- You cannot discontinue  a category if it has items or item aliases assigned to it. An item’s category  is specified in the **Item** profile  (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Item** profile). An item alias’s  category is specified in the **Item Alias**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Aliases 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Item Alias** profile **&gt; E-Commerce** tab **&gt; Additional Web Category**).
- To discontinue  an assigned category, you must change/reassign the category (that has  to be discontinued) in the **Item**  profile.
- Deactivating a  parent category deactivates its sub-categories as well.
