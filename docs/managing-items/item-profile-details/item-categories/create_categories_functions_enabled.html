<p>Creating item categories helps you in the following functions:</p>

<p><strong>Purchasing</strong></p>

<p>Grouping related items for purchase under relevant categories helps  you in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced 
 ordering costs:</strong> Ordering costs include manpower costs of obtaining  quotations, analyzing, processing and placing the order. By grouping related  items in one category, you can obtain price quotations from vendors for  all related items.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced 
 item costs:</strong> Placing a single order for many related items would  help you get a competitive price as against individual items.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sales</strong></p>

<p>Grouping related items for sale under relevant categories helps you  in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyze sales  by product line.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Growth in sales of Books as against growth in sales of Gifts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Obtain pending  sales orders in each category. This will help you place purchase orders  for pending items in that category.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">List of items with pending sales orders in the category “Multimedia  Kits”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organize the  display of items in your shop as well as on your <strong>Everest</strong>  online store.</li>
  <li>Provide discounts  to selected customers on a category.</li>
  <li>Promote cross-selling  schemes to boost the sales of slow moving items by offering discounts  on the sales of related fast moving items.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inventory</strong></p>

<p>The inventory department of any company typically has large numbers  of items to deal with. The amount of time spent on each item must be commensurate  with the items value or importance. Classifying items into categories  based on their value or importance ensures that the inventory department  has the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Items with  minimum quantity in each category.</li>
  <li>Stock status  for each category.</li>
  <li>Value of stock  in each category and costs of carrying the stock.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accounting</strong></p>

<p>Financial statements provide information on income and expenses on item  categories that the company deals in.</p>

<p class="example">A manufacturing company’s financial statement  gives the break up of expenses toward categories of Raw Materials.</p>

<p>Creating categories in <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to specify different accounts for income and expenses for the  category as a whole.</p>
