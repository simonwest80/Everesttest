<h1 id="non-serialized-inventoried-items">Non-serialized Inventoried Items</h1>

<p>It is impractical to serialize items like medicine bottles or clothing  as they are normally tracked by the batch or lot numbers of manufacture.  All units manufactured in a single batch are assigned a lot number.</p>

<p>When items are created as non-serialized, their cost is calculated based  on the weighted average cost of all the items in stock.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If you buy 100 units of an item at the rate  of $10 and another 100 units of the same item at $11, the cost of the  item would be averaged at $10.50.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Setting up an item as a non-serialized inventoried  item allows you to execute the following functions:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Assign lot  numbers to all the items purchased in a lot.</li>
  <li>Track the stock  of these items lot-wise for each stock area/bin.</li>
  <li>Assign the  manufacturer’s lot number.</li>
  <li>Obtain the  average cost information for the item.</li>
  <li>Track the movement  of units belonging to a lot through the purchase, sale, assembly or return  processes.</li>
</ul>
