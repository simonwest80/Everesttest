# Auto-serialized


Auto-serialized items are those for which serial numbers are automatically  generated and assigned by **Everest**  at the time of purchase. Since you do not want to manually track each  item, you would not affix serial number labels to it. However, you can  scan and assign the manufacturer's serial number to the item.


At the time of sale, **Everest**  automatically selects the quantity of the item from the default stock  area/bin specified. To automate this selection, select **None**  in the **Prompt method for selecting a 
 stock bin when auto-serializing sales document** field of the **Flow Control Setup** dialog box (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow****Control** > **Documents**  > **Prompts** > **Sales****Document** > **Sales 
 Document** **1** tab).

**Set up an item as auto-serialized if:**

- You want to  track the purchased items purchased by their manufacturer's serial numbers  instead of the serial numbers assigned to them. You can attach the manufacturer's  serial number to the item and let Everest automatically generate a serial  number.



{:.example}
Dealers in computer hardware may not want  to individually assign serial numbers to the pointing device (mouse),  but may still want to track their manufacturer's serial numbers.

- You want to  track the manufacturer's serial numbers of defective items that are shipped  to customers, because only customers can detect such items



{:.example}
A dealer in computers may want to track the  manufacturer's serial numbers of the keyboards shipped to customers as  this will help him return the defectives if any, to the right vendor.
