# Discontinue/Reactivate a Measure


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of measures. When a record is discontinued, it is  not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued record  can be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
**You can discontinue any measure, except **Each**.**
