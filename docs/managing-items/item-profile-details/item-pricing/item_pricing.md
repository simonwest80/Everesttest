# Item Pricing


The selling price of an item is the base price at which you sell the  item to your customer. The difference between the cost of the item (actual  cost in case of serialized inventory and average cost in case of non-serialized  inventory) and the selling price is your gross margin of profit. Item  pricing in **Everest** allows you  to:

- Select from  three different methods of price calculations.
- Specify different  prices for different customer levels.
- Specify different  prices for different quantity levels.
- Set up discount  schemes for the item based on quantity or customer.
- Define promotional  schemes.



{:.note}
Selling prices set up in the **Item**  profile can be changed in individual sales documents.
