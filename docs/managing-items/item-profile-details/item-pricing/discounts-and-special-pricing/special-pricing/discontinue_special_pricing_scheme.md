# Discontinue/Reactivate a Special Pricing Scheme


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of special pricing schemes. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.
