# Quantity Pricing


Quantity pricing schemes are specific to an item. Through the quantity  pricing scheme, you can define the percent markup or price for an item,  where the quantity ordered equals or exceeds the quantity defined. Percent  markup or selling prices can be defined for 5 levels of quantity. Although,  the base selling price may be calculated as a percent markup or a fixed  price, either type of pricing can be used while defining quantity pricing.


{:.note}
- The quantity discount  specified is not customer specific and applies to all customers.
- Prices are applicable  to each unit of measure.


You can specify only the percentage markup or price for a quantity.  However you can specify different pricing for different quantities.


{:.example}
You can define that, for an item, a quantity  of 100 be sold at a markup of 10 percent and a quantity of 200 be sold  at $10 each.


For a quantity that falls between two quantity levels, the discount  for the previous level is applied.


{:.example}
In the previous example, if a customer buys  125 (between 100 and 200); the customerâ€™s discount rate is 10% (applicable  for 100 quantity).
