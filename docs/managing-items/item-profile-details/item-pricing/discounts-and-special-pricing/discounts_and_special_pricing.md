# Discounts, Special Pricing and Promotions


**Everest** provides you the flexibility  to define a discount structure that is based on quantity, customer levels,  or a combination of both. You can also design special pricing schemes  for an item, item category, brand or customer.


The different kinds of discount schemes that you can set up are:

- [Quantity  Discounts]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/quantity-discounts/quantity_discounts.html)
- [Quantity  Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/quantity-pricing/quantity_pricing.html)
- [Promotional  Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/promotional-pricing/promotional_pricing.html)
- [Special  Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/special-pricing/special_pricing.html)



You can also define promotions or promotional campaigns, which are carried  out by offering discounts or free gifts on certain items for a certain  period to attract more customers.
