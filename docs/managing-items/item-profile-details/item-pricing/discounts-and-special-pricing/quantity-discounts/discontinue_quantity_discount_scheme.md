# Discontinue Quantity Discount Scheme


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of discount schemes. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
You cannot discontinue a quantity discount that is used in a document.
