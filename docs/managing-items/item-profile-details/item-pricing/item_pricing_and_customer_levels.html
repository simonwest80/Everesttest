<h1 id="item-pricing-and-customer-levels">Item Pricing and Customer Levels</h1>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to categorize  customers into a multitude of levels for the purpose of assigning a special  price to each of the customers. Each item can be priced at different levels  to entitle customers to discounts defined for the various levels. How  you define your levels is specific to your company.</p>

<p>You may choose to define level 1 or level 5 as the most valued (thus  qualifying it for maximum discounts) keeping in mind what each level represents.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If level 1 denotes new customers who qualify  for a moderate discount to encourage repeat sales and level 5 represents  customers are your most frequent customers who qualify for maximum discounts,  the prices you set up for them must reflect this.</strong></p>
