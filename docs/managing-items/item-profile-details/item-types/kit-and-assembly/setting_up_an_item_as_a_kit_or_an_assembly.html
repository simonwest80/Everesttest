<p>The choice of setting up an item as a kit or an assembly depends on  the type of the final item.</p>

<p><strong>Set up an item as a kit in the following  scenarios:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>When putting  together the items does not require significant value-addition of labor  and other resources.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Putting together a tennis kit that comprises  two tennis rackets, a pair of tennis ball and a sweat shirt does not require  too much labor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You sell the  components as individual items, and these sales are significant.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If the individual sales of the components  of a multimedia system are significant, it would be beneficial to set  up the multimedia system as a kit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The composition  of the item can be configured by the customer by upgrading/downgrading  it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Sellers of computer workstations give the  customers the option to decide the configuration of the product.</p>

<p><strong>**Set up an 
 item as an assembly</strong> <strong>in the following 
 scenarios</strong>:**</p>

<ul>
  <li>When significant  value-addition is required before the item is ready for sale.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Electronic products like calculators are assembled  items, where labor and overheads form a good percentage of the final costs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is important  to control and track variances in the cost of the final product by tracking  variations of input costs (material, labor and overheads) for each batch  assembled.</li>
  <li>The customer  is not given the option of configuring the product.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Laptops normally have a standard configuration  and it is better to create these as assemblies instead of kits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The item components  do not have any individual sales and it is important to maintain the inventory  of the final product.</li>
</ul>
