# Item Matrix


This is a group of items with defined attributes. The items in a matrix  represent unique combinations of the available attributes, with minimal  cost variations. Sales of items of different combinations are based on  customer preferences.


{:.example}
A 100% cotton branded shirt available in three sizes, two colors and  5 patterns is set up as a matrix.


**Item Matrix Wizard** helps you  create item matrices.


When an item matrix is created, two types of items are created:

- **Matrix 
 Group** - A master item with Matrix Group as the **Item 
 Type** to represent the item matrix.
- **Matrix 
 Item** - Individual combinations of the item with **Matrix 
 Item** as the **Item type**.



**Set up an item matrix when:**

- Your line of  business includes items that are sold in a variety of combinations with  minor price differences



{:.example}
Garments and shoes.

- It would be  very cumbersome to set up each combination as an individual item. When  you set up an item matrix, **Everest**  automates the process of setting up individual combinations of the item.



{:.example}
If a garment is available in combinations  of 3 sizes, 3 colors and 3 patterns, the total number of items within  the matrix would be 27.

- You need to  manage item stocks at the matrix level, the attribute level and the individual  item level.



{:.example}
If you run a garment store, you would like  to know the total stock of Beefy Haynes  T-shirts, all the T-shirts in white color, and the total stock of the  red, striped T-shirt in the size ‘large’.
