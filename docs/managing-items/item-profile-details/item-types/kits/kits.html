<p>A kit is a group of items sold as a single unit. When a kit is sold,  all the components of the kit are added to the sales document. The composition  of a kit can be altered at the time of sale.</p>

<p class="example">A computer kit may consist of items such as  a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse.</p>

<p>You  may sell a tennis kit with two tennis rackets, a pair of tennis balls  and a sweatshirt.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Everest</strong> handles kits as a single  item even though it consists of a group of items.</p>
