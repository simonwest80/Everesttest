# Accounting Information - Inventoried Items


The accounts to be specified for inventoried items need not be individually  specified in the **Item** profile.  Instead, you can select an Inventory Posting Group for the item. In the  transactions, the accounts get defaulted from the Posting Group associated  to the Item.


{:.note}
It is not necessary to define inventory Posting  Group at the item profile level. Generally the Posting Group defined at  the location level will be used for all items within that location. However  if the user wants to use a different set of account for a particular item  or item category in a location, then he needs to associate the Posting  Group to item category profile or item profile or location â€“category gird.
