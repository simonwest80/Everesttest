<p>The landed cost considers all costs incurred in bringing the inventory  items to their present location and condition. This includes the cost  of inventory, raw materials, warehousing and handling costs, reductions  made for trade discounts, rebates, purchase taxes and others.</p>

<p>Add-on costs are a component of the landed cost but are specific to  costs incurred in transporting the items from the seller’s location to  the buyer’s location. Add-on cost includes packaging charges, loading/unloading  charges, shipping insurance, import/export duties, courier charges, freight  charges, and any other costs incurred in the transportation process.</p>
