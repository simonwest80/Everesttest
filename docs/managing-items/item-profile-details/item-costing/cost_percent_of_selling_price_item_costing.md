# Cost Percent of Selling Price


Cost percent of selling price is used to set the cost of a non-inventoried  item as a percent of its selling price on a sales document. This cost  is a notional cost as it does not match either the actual cost or the  average cost.


{:.example}
**If you set up the cost of shipping to be 90%  of its selling price, and you bill $200 for shipping on a document, the  cost of shipping is computed at $180 but the bill that you receive from  your carrier for this may differ.**


When the cost of an item is calculated using this method, on sale an  accounting entry is made for the notional cost by debiting the expense  account for the item and crediting the liability account defined for the  item in the applicable Posting Group.
