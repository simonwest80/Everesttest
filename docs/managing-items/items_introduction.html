<p>Items are products and services that you buy and sell in the regular  course of business. What you set up as an item depends on the nature of  your business, the frequency of purchase or sale of the product or service.  It also depends on the extent of control that you would like to exercise  over the product or service, and the utility period of the product or  service purchased. Creating an item in <strong>Everest</strong>  gives you maximum control over its purchase, stocks, value, costs, prices  and utilization. Although there are no hard and fast rules for setting  up items, there are a few thumb rules that can influence your decision  on the products or services you want to set up as items. You can set up  as items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All products  and services that you bill your customers for.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you are running a book shop, books would  be your main line of business. However, you have to set up packing charges,  shipping and gift wrapping as items.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expenses that  are incurred by customers, since these will be added to the customer’s  bill</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If expenses that you incur for special handling  charges are met by customers, they must be set up as an item.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Products and  services that you frequently purchase for use in your business.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you are an attorney and you incur photocopying  expenses very frequently, set up photocopying charges as an item.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any product  or service over which you wish to exercise control, in procuring them.  This will help you track the price quotations from different vendors and  procure the item at competitive rates.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If stationery costs form a significant expense, create stationery as  an item to manage supplies better.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expenses that  form a part of the cost of an assembled item or an item kit as items.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Wages that have to be included in the cost of assembling a computer  must be set up as an item.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freight charges  that are calculated based on the items retrieved into a document. Doing  this helps you configure a default item that can be used for calculating  all freight charges for a document.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should not set up the following as items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Products or  services that facilitate routine business (but not sold directly or indirectly  in normal business) with utility of more than a year.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">A computer system may be essential for conducting  a business, but since its utility exceeds a year, it has to be created  as a fixed asset.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expenses that  cannot be charged off in the same year</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Expense on acquiring product patents cannot  be charged off in the same year as purchase; it has to be amortized over  its life.</p>
