<p class="example">A company was selling a particular type of red shirts. When  demand for the shirt increased, they decided to stock similar shirts in  all sizes. A matrix group was created for the entire lot. The red shirts  which were regular items earlier must now be merged into the new matrix  group.</p>

<p>Use the Item Profile to merge a regular item into a matrix group.</p>

<p class="steps">To merge a regular item into a matrix group,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Items</strong> browser (path: <strong>Inventory</strong>  &gt; <strong>Items</strong>), select the item to  be merged into a matrix group.</li>
  <li>Open the item in  the <strong>Item</strong> profile.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Assign Matrix Group</strong> from  the <strong>Item</strong> profile. The <strong>Change 
 Matrix Attribute and Element</strong> dialog box displays.</li>
</ul>
