# Merge a Regular Item into a Matrix Group


{:.example}
A company was selling a particular type of red shirts. When  demand for the shirt increased, they decided to stock similar shirts in  all sizes. A matrix group was created for the entire lot. The red shirts  which were regular items earlier must now be merged into the new matrix  group.
