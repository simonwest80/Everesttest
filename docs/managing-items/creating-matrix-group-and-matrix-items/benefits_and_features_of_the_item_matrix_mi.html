<p>The <strong>Item Matrix</strong> feature  of <strong>Everest</strong> is very useful for  creating and managing multi-dimensional product collections with user  defined attributes such as size, color, style, pattern and width. The  Matrix Wizard automates the process of creating and managing all the options  for each attribute and element and allows users to easily track inventory  for each unique product and the entire collection.</p>

<p>Intuitive navigation and UI elements such as the matrix grid  speedup item lookups, proposal creations and purchasing functions.</p>

<p>Thus, the Item Matrix feature of <strong>Everest</strong>  is the best fit for SMBs that deal with products like Apparel and Shoes.</p>
