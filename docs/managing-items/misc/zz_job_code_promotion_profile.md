title: Job Code
---


Select the job code that is used to track expenses and revenues associated with the promotional campaign.
: If you leave this field blank, when you save the profile, **Everest** will prompt whether you want to keep track of cost incurred for the promotion.
: If you click **No**, the profile will be saved, but you will not be able to keep track of the cost incurred. However you can select an existing job code.
: If you click **Yes**, a new **Job 
Costing** profile is displayed with the same code as the **Promotion profile**. If the **Job Code** already exists **Everest** prompts you to change the job code.
: The **Job Code**, **Description**, **Starts** and **Ends** fields in the **Job Costing** profile will be, by default, filled with the same values as defined in the **Promotion** profile. You can enter additional details like estimated revenue, estimated cost, status and customer in the profile.
