title: Use Item\'s Price
---


Check this option  to use the related item's price in the  sales document, instead of calculating any price differential, when the  original item is replaced with the related item. The **Price**differential field is disabled  when you check this option.


Leave this box unchecked  **Everest**  to apply the price difference between the related item and the original  item calculated according to the formula you have specified. If you have  not checked this option and have not specified any price difference between  the original item and the related item, **Everest**  displays the price of the original item in the sales document.


The **Use** **Itemâ€™s****Price** option helps you to arrive  at the price dynamically. You need not update the price differential during  fluctuations.


{:.example}
You have  chosen Intel P II, priced at $305 (Original item), but since it is out  of stock you decide on the related item Intel P III priced at $415. The  sales document will take $415 as the item price if you have CHECKED the  option **Use** **Item's****Price** in the **Related****Items** profile.


If you have the option UNCHECKED the price displayed in the sales document  will be $305 (When no price differential is specified).


When a price differential is specified the price displayed will  be adjusted based on the price difference formula you have specified in  the Price Differential dialog box.
