# Utility of Computing Costs as a Percent of Selling Price


Computing costs as a percentage of selling price ensures that profit  calculations for a sales document are realistic when you bill customers  for service items such as freight, shipping and packing. In such cases,  considering average cost for profit calculations would be misleading.


{:.example}
**If you have accounted for 2 shipping bills  received from your carrier for $500 and $1500 each, the average cost is  computed at $1000. If you bill your customer for $550 for shipping, **Everest** will debit the expense account  for shipping for $1000 for cost. The profit for this document would be  erroneous.**
