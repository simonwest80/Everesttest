<h1 id="utility-of-computing-costs-as-a-percent-of-selling-price">Utility of Computing Costs as a Percent of Selling Price</h1>

<p>Computing costs as a percentage of selling price ensures that profit  calculations for a sales document are realistic when you bill customers  for service items such as freight, shipping and packing. In such cases,  considering average cost for profit calculations would be misleading.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If you have accounted for 2 shipping bills  received from your carrier for $500 and $1500 each, the average cost is  computed at $1000. If you bill your customer for $550 for shipping, **Everest</strong> will debit the expense account  for shipping for $1000 for cost. The profit for this document would be  erroneous.**</p>
