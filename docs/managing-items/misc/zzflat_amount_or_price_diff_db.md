title: Flat amount (+ or -)
---


If you wish to specify a flat amount as the price difference choose  this option and enter the flat amount in the **Percentage/Amount** field.


{:.note}
**The price difference is positive by default,  and hence will always be added to the selling price of the item being  upgraded. If you wish to have a negative value for price difference, so  that it is subtracted from the selling price of the upgraded/downgraded  item you must prefix the percentage or amount with a '-' (minus)  sign.**
