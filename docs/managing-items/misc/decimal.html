<p>The decimal method must be used where the item’s quantity has to be  expressed in terms of decimal percentages of the base unit of the measure.  The quantity is expressed as the total number of base units of the measure  in the quantity followed by the decimal percentage of the base unit.</p>

<p class="example">If an item’s measure is a kilogram (1000 grams),  a quantity of 3 kilograms and 500 grams with a decimal accuracy of 1 would  be expressed as 3.5.</p>

<p><strong>Decimal Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>The decimal accuracy identifies the precision with which the percentage  of the measure’s base unit has to be expressed.</p>

<p class="example">In the example above, if more precision is  necessary, the decimal accuracy can be increased. If the decimal accuracy  is changed to 3, the quantity would be expressed as 3.500.</p>
