# Pending Purchase Order Committed Browser


The **Pending Purchase Order Committed**  browser displays a list of purchase orders that contain the selected item.  The details of items that you expect to receive from vendors are thus  provided.


Other purchase order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  terms, and due date are also displayed in this browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Order Committed** - The quantity that has been ordered (irrespective  of whether it has been partly received or not) is displayed, for all stock  areas.
- **Pending**  - The quantity that has NOT yet been received on the order is displayed.  Thus:Pending Quantity = On Order (quantity) - Received (quantity)
- **Received**  - The quantity that has already been received on the purchase order is  displayed. This column displays a value if the document is on back order.
- **Stock 
 Area** - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.



You can view the **Purchase Order**  profile from this browser by selecting **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.


Options common to all browsers are also available in this browser.
