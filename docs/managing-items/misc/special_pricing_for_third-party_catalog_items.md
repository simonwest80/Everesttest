# Special Pricing for Third-party Catalog Items


Special pricing can also be applied to third-party catalog items by  creating a Special Order item.


{:.steps}
To apply a special pricing to third party catalog items,  do the following:

- Create a non-inventoried  item to be used as the Special Order item from the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 New &gt; In New Window**).
- Create a third-party  catalog from the **Third-party Catalog**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Third-party 
 Catalog &gt; New &gt; In New Window**).



{:.note}
Y  You can also select an existing third-party catalog in the **Catalog 
 Code** field.

- In the **Third-party 
 Catalog** profile, select the non-inventoried item created in the  **Special order item code to be used**  field.
- From the **Inventory** menu, select **Discounts 
 &gt; Special Pricing**. You will see the **Special 
 Pricing** dialog box.
- In the **Special 
 Pricing Details** section of this dialog box, select Product as the  **Discount Type** and Specific Item  in the **Available On** field.
- Select the Special  Order item you have created in the **Item**  field.
- Specify the pricing  method for this Special Order item.



When an item from this third-party catalog is added to a shopping cart  and a promotion code applied, the special pricing discount is duly calculated  and applied to it.


The freight calculation for the item considers the measure specified  for the Special Order item and not that for each third-party item.
