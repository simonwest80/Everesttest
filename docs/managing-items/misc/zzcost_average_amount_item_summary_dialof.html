<p>The average cost per unit of purchase. The cost is arrived at by dividing  the total purchase value by the total quantity of purchase.</p>

<p>This cost may be different from the average cost of the items in stock.</p>

<p>The cost displayed in this field is different from the average cost  in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The item’s  purchase measure is not a single unit.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If  the purchase measure is a dozen, the average cost displayed in this field  is per unit whereas in the <strong>Item</strong> profile,  the average cost per dozen is displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In case of  serialized items, the average cost of purchase may be different from the  average cost of items in stock.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If 5 units of a serialized item is purchased at the following prices:</p>

<p>5, 10, 20, 25 and 30</p>

<p>Total cost of purchase = 90</p>

<p>Average cost of purchase = 18 (90/5)</p>

<p>If the first two items are sold the average cost displayed for the item  in stock is 25 (75/3) while the average cost of purchase remains the same.</p>
