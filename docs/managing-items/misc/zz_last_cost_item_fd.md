title: Last Cost
---


This field indicates the most recent cost at which the item has been  purchased converted to the stock measure. The last cost in the purchase  measure is converted to the last cost in the stock measure based on the  conversion factor between the stock and purchase measures at the time  the last cost for each purchase measure is updated.


This field can be left at 0 when creating a new item. When you purchase  an item, **Everest** automatically  updates this field. The Last Cost field always accepts up to six decimal  places.


{:.note}
The last cost of a Kit is not updated when there is a change in the  last cost of any of the items that comprise the Kit. None of the related  fields in the **Purchase** tab of  the **Item** profile are automatically  updated for kit items. The kitâ€™s last cost has to be manually updated  to reflect the changes in the last cost of component items.


The last cost does not get updated if you select the option **Do 
 Not Update Last Cost When Receiving** (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Bins&gt; 
 For Purchase**).
