<p>Net free stock is the stock on hand that is not committed for shipment  against sales orders and debit orders less non-saleable stock. In this  tab, you can identify those stock area/bin types that have non-saleable  stock. When free stock is calculated, stocks in the areas of the types  selected will be excluded from free stock.</p>

<p>You can view the net free stock of an item in the <strong>Item 
 Stock Status</strong> dialog box.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If the stock type ‘Scrap’ is left unchecked,  then this stock type will not be included in the calculation for the Net  Free Stock. The **Stock Status</strong> dialog  box will then display the Net Free Stock for the item, after excluding  any scrap available for the item.**</p>
