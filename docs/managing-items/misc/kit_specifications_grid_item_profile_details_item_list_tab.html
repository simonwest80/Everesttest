<p>The price retrieved into the <strong>Kit Specifications 
 Grid</strong> considers quantity pricing if any, defined for the item. When  an item is added to a kit, it shows the default purchase and sales measures  for the item. These measures can be changed to any other purchase or sales  measure of the kit component.</p>
