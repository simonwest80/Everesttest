title: Element Separator
---


Select a suitable element separator from the drop-down to  separate the Group Code, Prefix and Description. Every matrix item will  have the element separator you have chosen to distinguish between the  prefix and the attribute code. Select **None**  if you do not want to use an element separator.


{:.example}
87456-003-s denotes the  Prefix 87456 and Color code (Chestnut) and Size (s). Item codes can only  have a maximum length of 15 characters. Â Using  the None option provides you with the ability to configure more complex  matrix items.


The allowed characters for Element Separators are:


| Element Separator | Description |
| None | No Element Separator |
| - | Hyphen |
| / | Front slash |
| \* | Asterisk |
| # | Hash |
| : | Colon |
| ; | Semi-colon |
| , | Comma |
| \_ | Underscore |
| < | Lesser than |
| > | Greater than |



If the item code exceeds more than 15 characters including  the separators, a warning message displays.
