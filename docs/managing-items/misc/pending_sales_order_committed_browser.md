# Pending Sales Order Committed Browser


The **Pending Sales Order Committed**  browser displays a list of sales orders that contain committed quantities  of the selected item.


The details of items that you expect to ship to customers are thus provided.


Other sales order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in this browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Reserve** - The quantity that has been ordered by the customer (irrespective  of whether it has been partly shipped or not) is displayed.
- **Pending**  - The quantity that has NOT yet been shipped on the order is displayed.  Thus: Pending (Quantity) = On Reserve (quantity) - Shipped (quantity)
- **Shipped**  - The quantity that has already been shipped on the sales order is displayed.  This column displays a value if the document is on back order.
- **On 
 Reserve Committed** â€“ The committed quantity of the item available  in all stock areas is displayed.
- **Stock 
 Area** - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.



You can view the **Sales Order**  profile from this browser by selecting **Options
