title: (Last cost of the upgrade/downgrade item - last cost of original item)
---


If the price difference is calculated as a percentage of the difference  between the last cost of the upgrade/downgrade item and the last cost  of the original item select this option and enter the percentage  in the **Percentage/Amount** field.


The result of applying the percentage on the base value will be displayed  in the **Result** field. You can also  give a negative percentage (in case of downgraded items).


{:.example}
**If the last cost of the original item is $200  and the last cost of the upgraded item is $300, and the percentage differential  is given as 10%, the **Result** field  (i.e. the price differential amount) displays $10. The price for the upgraded  item would be the selling price of the original item + price differential  amount. If the differential is negative, the formula automatically takes  care of it.**
