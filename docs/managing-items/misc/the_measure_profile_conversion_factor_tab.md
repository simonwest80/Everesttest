The value of stock computed when either the **Fractional**  or **Decimal** method is selected  is illustrated in the following example:


{:.example}
If an item's measure is a kilogram, and the base unit is 1000 grams,  2 and a half kilograms would be expressed as 2:500 under the fractional  method. The value of the quantity at a rate of $2 would be calculated  as follows:


2 \* $2 + (500/1000)\*$2


If the quantity is 2 kilograms and 500 grams and the decimal accuracy  is 3, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed as 2.500.


The value of the quantity would be calculated as follows:


2.500\*$2
