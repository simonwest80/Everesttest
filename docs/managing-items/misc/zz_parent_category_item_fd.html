<p>Specify the parent category, if the category being defined is a subcategory.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to create  unlimited levels of item categories. The category tree shows the different  levels of item categories and their sub categories. The parent category  in the category profile identifies the immediately preceding category.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If a computer is a category and desktops  and notebooks are categories under computers the category computers will  be identified as the parent category in the **Category</strong>  profile of desktops  and notebooks.**</p>
