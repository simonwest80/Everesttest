<h1 id="how-is-an-items-selling-price-calculated">How is an Item’s Selling Price Calculated?</h1>

<p>An item’s selling price can be calculated by each of these methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Base selling  price calculation (fixed price or percent markup on cost or percent of  invoice total).</li>
  <li>Selling price  for the customer level (Advanced option for calculating selling price  at different customer levels).</li>
  <li>Selling price  at the quantity ordered (Special quantity pricing scheme for the item).</li>
  <li>Selling price  for the item in a specified period (Promotional pricing).</li>
  <li>Selling price  for the item with special pricing rules (Special pricing).</li>
</ul>

<p>The selling price that is the least of all the above prices is the price  displayed for the item on the sales document.</p>

<p class="note">The least price is dependent upon preferences  set in <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Pricing/Discounts</strong> tab. If  you check the <strong>Customer level price to 
 override list price for price calculation option</strong>, it ignores the  List Price (Fixed Price/% Markup) if a Customer Level price is defined.  If this option is unchecked, it considers the List Price in the least  price calculation. If you check this option and a Customer Level price  is not defined, the List Price is considered along with Quantity pricing,  Promotional pricing, and Special pricing to arrive at the least price.</p>
