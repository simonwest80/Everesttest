<p>This field allows you to have an non-inventoried item show  in the drop down list for a kit, but be omitted from the sales order.   This field  pertains to non-inventoried items with $0.00 price that are selected as  components of kits either as a kit item or as a related item to a kit  item.</p>

<p class="example">A kit contains an inventoried item, “Printer1”,  with related items of “Printer2” and “No Printer”.  The  “No Printer” item is marked as an optional item.  If  a web shopper selects “No Printer” on the kit configuration page and the  price is $0.00, it will be omitted from the sales order.</p>

<p>An item marked as an optional item displays on the Shopping  Cart page of the web store if it is included as part of a kit , but does  not print on the sales order if its price is $0.00.  If  the price of an item marked as an optional item is updated to a value  greater than $0.00, the item is no longer considered an optional item  and will be displayed in the sales order.</p>

<p class="note">This feature is only available with <strong>Everest eStorefront Professional</strong>.</p>
