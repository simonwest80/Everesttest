# Utility of Factored Costs

- Factoring costs helps to conceal the actual gross margins on a sale since it is the factored cost of an item that appears on a sales document.
- Factoring costs reduces the sales commission payable on profits of a sale. If you pay commission based on profits, and you want this profit to reflect your net margins (gross profit less other expenses) instead of gross margins (before considering the other expenses), use factored costs. The profit for commission purpose is then calculated considering the factored costs.
