<p>Special pricing can also be applied to third-party catalog items by  creating a Special Order item.</p>

<p class="steps">To apply a special pricing to third party catalog items,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a non-inventoried  item to be used as the Special Order item from the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 New &gt; In New Window</strong>).</li>
  <li>Create a third-party  catalog from the <strong>Third-party Catalog</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Third-party 
 Catalog &gt; New &gt; In New Window</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Y  You can also select an existing third-party catalog in the <strong>Catalog 
 Code</strong> field.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>Third-party 
 Catalog</strong> profile, select the non-inventoried item created in the  <strong>Special order item code to be used</strong>  field.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Inventory</strong> menu, select <strong>Discounts 
 &gt; Special Pricing</strong>. You will see the <strong>Special 
 Pricing</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Special 
 Pricing Details</strong> section of this dialog box, select Product as the  <strong>Discount Type</strong> and Specific Item  in the <strong>Available On</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Select the Special  Order item you have created in the <strong>Item</strong>  field.</li>
  <li>Specify the pricing  method for this Special Order item.</li>
</ul>

<p>When an item from this third-party catalog is added to a shopping cart  and a promotion code applied, the special pricing discount is duly calculated  and applied to it.</p>

<p>The freight calculation for the item considers the measure specified  for the Special Order item and not that for each third-party item.</p>
