title: Sales By Purchases - Ratios
---


The total value of sales as displayed in the **Sales 
 (qty)** field divided by the total value of purchases as displayed  in the **Purchase (qty)** field is  displayed. This ratio indicates the percentage of the quantity purchased  that has been sold. A low ratio would lead to an inventory build up of  the item and indicates that sales do not meet expectations.
