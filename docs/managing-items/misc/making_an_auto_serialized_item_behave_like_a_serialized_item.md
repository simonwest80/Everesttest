# Making an Auto-serialized Item Behave like a Serialized Item


An auto-serialized item can be tracked like a serialized item. To do  so:

- Assign the  manufacturer's serial number to the item when purchasing it (from the  Purchase Order/Receipt/Invoice), or selling it (from the Sales Order or  Sales Invoice) or from the **Serial Numbe**r  profile.
- You can set  the flow control preference to your requirement. If the preference is  set to skip such items, auto-serialized items with the manufacturer's  serial numbers will not be automatically assigned to a document. If preference  is set to prompt the user, **Everest**  will ask you whether the item with the manufacturer's serial number has  to be attached to the sales document.



Either way, you can ensure that the item attached to the document is  identical to the one sold or returned.
