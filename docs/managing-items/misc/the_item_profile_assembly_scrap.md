# The Item Profile - Assembly - Scrap


Use the **Scrap** tab to specify  the scrap that is generated during the assembly process. Scrap is the  by-product or any material having some value that is generated during  the assembly/manufacture process.


Scrap details


The Scrap Details Grid allows you to specify the scrap that is generated  when one stock measure of the assembly item is created. Scrap that is  derived when a particular item is assembled should be set up as an item  in **Everest**.


{:.steps}
To add an item to the scrap details grid, do the following:

- From the **Assembly - Scrap** tab of the **Item** profile, right-click anywhere in the grid.
- Select **Items** > **Selection**  from the right-click menu. You will see the **Items**  browser.
- Select the  required items and click **OK**.



When you add an item, by default the quantity displayed is 1. The average  cost of the item at the time of adding the scrap item to the **Scrap**  tab is also displayed. This cost can be edited.


Only Non-serialized inventoried and Non-inventoried items can be selected  as scrap items. The item for which the assembly is being built cannot  be selected as scrap.
