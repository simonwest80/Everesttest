<p>If the price difference is calculated as a percentage of the difference  between the last cost of the upgrade/downgrade item and the last cost  of the original item select this option and enter the percentage  in the <strong>Percentage/Amount</strong> field.</p>

<p>The result of applying the percentage on the base value will be displayed  in the <strong>Result</strong> field. You can also  give a negative percentage (in case of downgraded items).</p>

<p class="example"><strong>If the last cost of the original item is $200  and the last cost of the upgraded item is $300, and the percentage differential  is given as 10%, the **Result</strong> field  (i.e. the price differential amount) displays $10. The price for the upgraded  item would be the selling price of the original item + price differential  amount. If the differential is negative, the formula automatically takes  care of it.**</p>
