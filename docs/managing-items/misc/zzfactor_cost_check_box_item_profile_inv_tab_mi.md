When costs are factored, the item's selling price is calculated using  the factored cost. If sales commission is payable on profits, the profit  is computed by deducting the factored costs from the selling price. Factoring  costs:

1. **Helps to conceal the  actual gross margins on a sale since it is the factored cost of an item  that appears on a sales document.**
- **Reduces the sales commission  payable on profits. If you want this profit to reflect net margins (gross  profit less other expenses) instead of gross margins (before considering  the other expenses), use factored costs to calculate this commission.**
