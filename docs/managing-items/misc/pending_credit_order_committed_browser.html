<p>Other credit order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in this browser.</p>

<p>The following quantity columns are also displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On 
 Credit Committed</strong> - The quantity of returns expected from the customer  on the particular credit order is displayed, for all stock areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Pending</strong>  - The net quantity that has NOT yet been received from the customer is  displayed. Thus: Pending (quantity) = On Credit (quantity) - Received  (quantity)</li>

  <li><strong>Stock 
 Area</strong> - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.</li>
