After you select the parameter based on which to perform the item search  (by weight), you must either:

- Specify the starting  value in the first field and the ending value in the second field beside  the **Weight** field. You must specify  both values if the parameter requires a range to be specified, or
- Enter the value  in the first field, if the parameter requires one value to be specified.  The second field is disabled.
