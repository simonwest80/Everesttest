<p>The price differential is the difference between the selling price of  the original item and its upgrade. When defining a price differential,  you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter a flat  amount or</li>
  <li>Use a formula  to calculate the price differential.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Selling  Price of Item A +/- Price Differential = Selling Price of Item B (the  related item).</p>

<p>In order to specify a flat amount, enter the amount in <strong>Price 
 Differential</strong> field. Note that while specifying the price differential  for a downgrade item, the amount should be prefixed by a ‘-’ (minus) sign.  This is done to indicate that the price differential will have to be subtracted  from the selling price of the item being downgraded.</p>
