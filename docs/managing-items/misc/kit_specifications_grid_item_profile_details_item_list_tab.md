This grid lists the details of the items contained in the kit. To add  an item to the kit, right-click anywhere in the grid and select **Items** > **Selection**.  From the Items browser, select the required items and click **OK**.


When you add an item to the kit, details such as item category, description,  cost, price, and discount value are displayed. The sales and purchase  quantity columns default to 1 with the quantity decimal accuracy of the  selected items. You can change the sales and purchase quantity, description/notes,  price and discount values, if required.


The price retrieved into the **Kit Specifications 
 Grid** considers quantity pricing if any, defined for the item. When  an item is added to a kit, it shows the default purchase and sales measures  for the item. These measures can be changed to any other purchase or sales  measure of the kit component.
