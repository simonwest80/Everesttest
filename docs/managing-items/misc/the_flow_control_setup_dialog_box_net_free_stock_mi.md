# The Items Dialog Box - Net Free Stock


Net free stock is the stock on hand that is not committed for shipment  against sales orders and debit orders less non-saleable stock. In this  tab, you can identify those stock area/bin types that have non-saleable  stock. When free stock is calculated, stocks in the areas of the types  selected will be excluded from free stock.


You can view the net free stock of an item in the **Item 
 Stock Status** dialog box.


{:.example}
**If the stock type ‘Scrap’ is left unchecked,  then this stock type will not be included in the calculation for the Net  Free Stock. The **Stock Status** dialog  box will then display the Net Free Stock for the item, after excluding  any scrap available for the item.**
