<h1 id="unit-fixed-price">Unit Fixed Price</h1>

<p>This is the price per unit of sales measure of an item. The measure  specified in the <strong>Other sales information</strong>  section of the <strong>Sales</strong> tab is considered  when calculating the unit fixed price. The unit fixed price is calculated  as follows:</p>

<p>Fixed Price / Unit Quantity of the Measure</p>

<p class="example">The fixed price of Item A is $12 and the sales  measure is specified as ‘DZ’  (Dozen). The unit quantity specified for ‘DZ’  is 12. Therefore, the unit fixed price is calculated as: 12/12 = $1.</p>

<p>This field is enabled only if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the  quantity in sales measure is more than 1</li>
</ul>

<p>When you change the fixed price in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile with sales measure more than one, <strong>Everest</strong>  calculates unit fixed price up to 6 decimals.</p>

<p>In sales and purchase documents, the unit price is rounded off based  on the unit quantity in the measure.</p>

<p class="example">If quantity in measure is 0-9, unit fixed  price is calculated up to two decimals, and if quantity in measure has  5 digits (10000-99999), unit fixed price is calculated up to six decimals.</p>
