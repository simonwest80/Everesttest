The **Pending Debit Orders** displays  a list of debit orders that contain the selected item. Purchase Orders  are displayed with respect to each location that is added to the **Items** browser. The details of returns  that you expect to be made to vendors are thus provided.


Other debit order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in the **Pending

The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Debit** - The quantity of returns that you expect to make to the  vendor on the particular debit order is displayed.
- **Pending** - The net quantity that has NOT yet been made to the vendor is  displayed. Thus:



Pending (quantity) = On Debit (quantity)  - Shipped (quantity)

- **Shipped** - The quantity that has already been returned on the debit order  is displayed. This column displays a value if the document is on back  order.
