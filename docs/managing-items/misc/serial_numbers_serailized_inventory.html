<h1 id="serial-numbers">Serial Numbers</h1>

<p>Serial numbers are used to track individual units of inventory using  either the manufacturer’s serial number or an internal number generated  by <strong>Everest</strong> during the purchase  process. Serial numbers help you track the origin and history of each  item.</p>

<p>Very often, certain parts do not have a unique manufacturer assigned  serial number or have many different barcodes.  The serial number provides vital information such as the true cost, purchase  date and vendor, sales date and customer, and a complete audit trail of  movements of the unit from the <strong>Serial 
 Numbers</strong> browser. Serial number tracking is one of <strong>Everest</strong>’s  most fundamental and powerful features.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the benefits of tracking serial numbers  are:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>True 
 cost calculations</strong> - Each serial number is assigned an individual  cost, even if the same product is purchased at different costs. This provides  more accurate profit/loss statements.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster 
 Processing</strong> - Serial numbers can be scanned or directly entered  to facilitate invoice processing and any movement of items, like transfer  to a different stock area/bin.</li>
  <li><strong>Accurate 
 Inventory</strong> - Each serial number is associated to an item in the  inventory. If an incorrect item is pulled from the stock to fulfill a  customer’s order, <strong>Everest</strong> will  notify you of the mistake.</li>
  <li><strong>Better 
 Customer Service</strong> - Serial numbers are printed on all the documents  including customer invoice, providing the customer with more information.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy 
 RMAs</strong>  - Serial number tracking of items provides the complete purchase and sales  information for the item, simplifying the return authorization process,  both from customers and to vendors. This is especially useful when purchasing  the same item from multiple vendors.</li>
  <li><strong>Multistock 
 Area Tracking</strong> - Serialized items allow stock area tracking and  provide a full audit trail of inventory movements between sub-locations,  locations and stock areas. If certain items are always purchased from  only one vendor, <strong>Everest’s</strong> auto-serialize  feature can be enabled to enter the manufacturer’s serial numbers when  a product is being shipped to a customer rather than when it is being  received from the vendor.</li>
</ul>
