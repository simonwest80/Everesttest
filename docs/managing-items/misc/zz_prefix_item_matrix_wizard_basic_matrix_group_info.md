title: Prefix
---


The code of an individual matrix item is made up of a combination  of the elements defined in the later sections of this wizard. The prefix  is entered in this field. You can enter a unique code of up to fifteen  characters in the Prefix field. This is a mandatory field.


Specify a Prefix for your Item Matrix.


{:.example}
The prefix is **87456**  in this example.


{:.note}
It is always better to create a Prefix of  shorter length to control the length of the matrix item code.
