# How are Item Discounts Given?


Discount on an item can be calculated by each of these methods:

- Discount available  for the customer level at the quantity ordered (Quantity discount scheme  at the customer level).
- Discount available  on the item in a specified period (Promotional pricing).
- Discount available  on the item with special pricing rules (Special pricing)



The discount that is the highest of all the above discounts is the discount  displayed for the item on the sales document.
