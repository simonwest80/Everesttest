<p>Use the <strong>Scrap</strong> tab to specify  the scrap that is generated during the assembly process. Scrap is the  by-product or any material having some value that is generated during  the assembly/manufacture process.</p>

<p>Scrap details</p>

<p>The Scrap Details Grid allows you to specify the scrap that is generated  when one stock measure of the assembly item is created. Scrap that is  derived when a particular item is assembled should be set up as an item  in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p class="steps">To add an item to the scrap details grid, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Assembly - Scrap</strong> tab of the <strong>Item</strong> profile, right-click anywhere in the grid.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Selection</strong>  from the right-click menu. You will see the <strong>Items</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>Select the  required items and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you add an item, by default the quantity displayed is 1. The average  cost of the item at the time of adding the scrap item to the <strong>Scrap</strong>  tab is also displayed. This cost can be edited.</p>

<p>Only Non-serialized inventoried and Non-inventoried items can be selected  as scrap items. The item for which the assembly is being built cannot  be selected as scrap.</p>
