<p>The description of the item selected in the <strong>Related 
 Item Code</strong> field will be displayed here. You can edit this field  if required. The <strong>Related Items</strong>  browser is updated with any change made to the description of a related  item.</p>

<p class="note">If the description of the related item is changed in the <strong>Related 
 Items</strong> tab of an <strong>Item</strong> profile,  it will be used only when that item is retrieved into a document and is  replaced with the related item. It does not update the description in  the <strong>Related</strong> <strong>Items</strong>  tab for all those items where this item is specified as a related item.  You will have to manually edit such item descriptions if required.</p>

<p class="example">Item code X with a description “80GB Hard Drive” is a related  item for items Y  and Z. Changing  the description of item code X  in  the <strong>Related Items</strong> tab of ITEM  Y to “80GB  Hard Drive (7500RPM)” will not automatically change the description  in the Related Items tab of items Z.   Also, the  <strong>Item</strong> profile for Item code X will  still display “80GB Hard Drive”.</p>

<p>If required, you can manually change the description in the <strong>Related 
 Items</strong> tab by opening the <strong>Item</strong>  profile of item Z  and accessing the <strong>Related Items</strong>  tab.</p>
