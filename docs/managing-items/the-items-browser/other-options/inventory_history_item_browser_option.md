# Inventory History


Use the **Inventory History** option  to view the stock history of an inventoried item. Use this option to:

- View a chronological  record of all transactions that affect the item's inventory quantity or  value.
- View the impact  of each transaction on the item's stock and value.



Transactions for the item that are carried out through Purchase Receipts  and Invoices, Debit Memos, Credit Memos, Sales Invoices and Inventory  Adjustment Documents are recorded in the item's history. Stock movements  and transactions that do not affect the item's inventory are not found  in the inventory history.


{:.example}
Stock transfers, quantity committed on purchase  orders and sales orders are not recorded in the item's history.


{:.note}
This option is disabled for non-inventoried items.


When you access the **Inventory History**  option, you will see the [**Inventory History** browser]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/misc/the_inventory_history_browser.html) for the  selected item.
