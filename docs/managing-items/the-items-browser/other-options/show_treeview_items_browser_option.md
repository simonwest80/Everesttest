# Show Tree view


Use this option to toggle between ‘normal view’  and ‘tree view’  of the **Items** browser. By default,  the **Items** browser displays records  one below the other. When you select this option, item categories are  displayed on the left panel. The items belonging to each category are  displayed in the right panel. To return to the ‘normal view’,  select **Hide Tree view**. All options  available in the **Items** browser  are also available in the tree view.
