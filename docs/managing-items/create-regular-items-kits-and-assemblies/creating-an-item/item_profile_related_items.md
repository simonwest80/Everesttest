# The Item Profile - Related Items


Related items represent items that can be sold or purchased as substitutes,  or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item. Upgrading an item can be defined  as selling/purchasing an enhanced version of an existing product. Downgrading  an item can be defined as selling /purchasing a product that has fewer  features than an existing product. The **Related 
 Items** tab allows you to select items that can be sold or purchased  as substitutes or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item.


This tab allows you to:

- Define multiple  upgrades or downgrades for an item. You can also define multiple related  items with the same item code but with different sales measures.
- Specify Price  Differentials for the upgrades or downgrades (indicate a fixed price or  a formula, as the upgrade price, that will enable you to arrive at a new  price for the upgraded item.
- Make  these upgrades/downgrades and their price differentials available for  specific item kits.
