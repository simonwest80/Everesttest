<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of items. When a record is discontinued, it is not  deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued record can  be made available for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>You can discontinue all item types (regular,  item kit and assembly) created in **Everest</strong>.  You can also discontinue an item that has stock and view its stock from  the <strong>Item Stock Status</strong> browser.**</p>
