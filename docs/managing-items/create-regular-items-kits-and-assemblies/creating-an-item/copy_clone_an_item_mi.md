# Copy/Clone an Item


You can copy/clone an item and create duplicates for various  purposes. The **Item code** is unique  to an item in **Everest**. Hence,  the item code of the duplicate item must vary from the item code of the  original item, when you clone an item.


{:.example}
You start carrying a new product that is nearly  identical to an existing item.  Instead  of re-entering all the product details, use the clone feature to copy  the existing item's detail into the **Item**  profile.


{:.note}
Custom field details are copied when you clone  an item profile.  Custom  field details are not copied when cloning other profiles.


{:.steps}
To copy/clone an item, do the following:

- Select **Options**  > **New** > **In 
 New Window** from the Items browser (path: **Inventory**  > **Items**). The **Item**  profile displays.
- Select the item  code of the item you wish to copy from the **Item 
 code** drop-down list. All details of the original item populates  in the **Item** profile.
- Change the **Item code** field. This is mandatory.
- Make other changes  as necessary and click the **Save and Close**  button.



{:.note}
You can design an **Item**  profile with an additional tab to include as many custom fields as you  require. Set the newly designed **Item**  profile as your default in the **Forms**  browser (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Forms**).  When you copy an item with, say 10 plus custom fields, all the fields  are copied to the cloned item.
