# Discontinue/Reactivate an Item


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of items. When a record is discontinued, it is not  deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued record can  be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
**You can discontinue all item types (regular,  item kit and assembly) created in **Everest**.  You can also discontinue an item that has stock and view its stock from  the **Item Stock Status** browser.**
