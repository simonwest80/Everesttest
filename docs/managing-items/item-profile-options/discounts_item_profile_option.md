# Discounts


**Everest** provides you the flexibility to define a discount structure that is based on quantity, customer levels, or a combination of both. You may also design special pricing schemes for an item, item category, brand or customer.


The different kinds of discount schemes that may be set up from the **Item** profile are:

- [Quantity Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/quantity-pricing/quantity_pricing.html)
- [Promotional Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/promotional-pricing/promotional_pricing.html)
- [Special Pricing]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/item-profile-details/item-pricing/discounts-and-special-pricing/special-pricing/special_pricing.html)
