# Access the Forms Designer


Only users with the proper security privilege and a valid license key  can access the Forms Designer.  On  profiles that can be customized, a **Design**  option displays on the **Options**  menu.  This  option does not appear on a profile that cannot be customized.


{:.steps}
To access the Forms Designer, do one of the  following:

- From the **Options** menu of a profile that can be  customized, select **Design**.



Or

- From the main  menu bar, select **File** > **Setup** > **Forms**. **&nbsp;**Right  click **** a profile template  and select **Design**.



The Forms Designer displays the current form in  **Design** view.  Design  view is indicated by “Design” next to the form title in the title bar.


{:.example}
When an **Item**  profile is in design view, it is labeled **Design-Item** profile.


When the Forms Designer opens, several dialog boxes  open including the following:

- Field Chooser  - Contains fields for the profile being designed
- Component Palette  - Toolbox used to add windows controls
- Object Inspector  - Used to change object properties such as captions



The Standard or initial profile form loaded is called  the **Template**. The version of the  form that you are designing or editing is called the **Target 
 Form**.
