# Field Chooser


The **Field Chooser** contains a  tree view of all the fields available for the form. Use the Field Chooser  to add tabs, groups, and controls to the target form. If you add an item  that is grouped with other items, the additional items are added automatically.  Each field can only be in one place on the target form. The **Field 
 Chooser** dialog box is re-sizable and multiple items can be selected  at the same time.


The following field types are located in the **Field 
 Chooser** dialog box:

- Missing Fields - The fields that are missing from the target  form are highlighted in the Field Chooser.
- **Fields in Use**  - The fields used on the target form are not highlighted in the Field  Chooser.
- **Mandatory Fields**  - Mandatory fields are in bold. If a mandatory is not highlighted, it  is a missing mandatory field that must be added to the target form.
