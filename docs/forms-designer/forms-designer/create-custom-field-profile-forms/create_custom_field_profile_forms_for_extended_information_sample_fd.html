<p><strong>Custom Fields</strong> profiles are accessible  from various browsers including the sales documents browsers, such as  the Sales Opportunity browser and the Sales Orders browser, and from the  purchase document, Users, Customers, Vendors, Items, Tasks, and Serial  Numbers browsers. You can access the <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> profile from these browsers by entering <strong>Ctrl 
 +</strong> F from within the browser.</p>

<p class="note">The <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> profile is also know as the <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> dialog box.</p>

<p class="example">PetProducts, Inc. is a pet food manufacturer and sells a variety of  Pet Food and other products.  They  have one marketing representative who researches and introduces new sales  opportunities by visiting various wholesale dealers and distributors of  pet food products.</p>

<p>The default Sales Opportunity profile in <strong>Everest</strong>  displays much more information than they need to capture so they reorganized  their Sales Opportunity profile using the <strong>Everest 
 Forms Designer</strong> to show only Customer, Source, value, and pet food  storage capabilities.</p>

<p>They also need to capture the number of years that the dealerships have  been in operation, and, in the case of distributors, the areas of operation.  They wanted to access this information from the Sales Opportunity browser  as extended information.</p>

<p>To do this, they customized the <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> profile which is opened from the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunity</strong> browser as well as the other sales document browsers.</p>
