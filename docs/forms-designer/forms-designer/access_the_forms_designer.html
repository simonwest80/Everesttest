<p>Only users with the proper security privilege and a valid license key  can access the Forms Designer.  On  profiles that can be customized, a <strong>Design</strong>  option displays on the <strong>Options</strong>  menu.  This  option does not appear on a profile that cannot be customized.</p>

<p class="steps">To access the Forms Designer, do one of the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Options</strong> menu of a profile that can be  customized, select <strong>Design</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Forms</strong>. <strong> </strong>Right  click <strong>** a profile template  and select **Design</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Forms Designer displays the current form in  <strong>Design</strong> view.  Design  view is indicated by “Design” next to the form title in the title bar.</p>

<p class="example">When an <strong>Item</strong>  profile is in design view, it is labeled <strong>Design-Item</strong> profile.</p>

<p>When the Forms Designer opens, several dialog boxes  open including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Field Chooser  - Contains fields for the profile being designed</li>
  <li>Component Palette  - Toolbox used to add windows controls</li>
  <li>Object Inspector  - Used to change object properties such as captions</li>
</ul>

<p>The Standard or initial profile form loaded is called  the <strong>Template</strong>. The version of the  form that you are designing or editing is called the <strong>Target 
 Form</strong>.</p>
