# Add a Dynamic Tab


Use the Field Chooser to add dynamic tabs to the target form.  System  dynamic tabs such as E-Commerce (Item profile), Multimedia, and Related  Items are created in **Everest** at  run time. While the content of these tabs cannot be designed, the tab  properties can be changed.


{:.steps}
To add a dynamic tab to the target form,  do the following:

- Click on a dynamic  tab sheet in the Field Chooser. You will see a **Target**  icon underneath your cursor when your cursor is over a valid container  for the drop.  If  you do not see the Target icon, move your cursor until the Target icon  is in view.

Targeted Drop Cursor

- Click a location  on the target form. The target icon is no longer underneath your cursor  and the Dynamic Tab is added to the target form.



You cannot edit objects contained within the tab control of a dynamic  tab. You can only change the properties of the tab container (tab sheet).   For example,  you can change the name of the dynamic tab and reorder a dynamic tab on  the target form. If a dynamic tab is not mandatory, the tab can be deleted.   You can  add it again, if necessary.
