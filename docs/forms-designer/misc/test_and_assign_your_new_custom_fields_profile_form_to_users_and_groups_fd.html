<p class="steps">To test and assign your new Custom Fields  profile form, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must assign  your profile version to a user or group for it to become active. See the  <strong>Assign 
 a Profile Version to a User or Group</strong> section for information  on how to make the assignments.</li>
  <li>To test the form,  assign it to one user first to make sure that it is working correctly.  Make any necessary adjustments. After you are comfortable with the form,  you can assign it to other users. 
Once the profile is active, access the customized <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> profile from the browser that you used to design it. For  this example, it can be accessed from any sales document profile. You  can create different <strong>Custom Fields</strong>  profiles for each browser type where it is available.</li>
</ul>
