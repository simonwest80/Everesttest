The **Form** field, located above  the tree view section, displays the form version in the tree view below.


The **Form** tree view section contains  a list of each customizable profile. Below those profiles in the tree  view, are the customized versions of that profile that have been created  in the Forms Designer.

The **Assigned** section contains  a list of the groups assigned to the selected form.

The **UnAssigned** section contains  a list of groups that can be assigned to the selected form.

# Grant Groups a Version of the Form


The **Assign Forms** dialog box  for groups (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Assign****Forms** > **Groups**)  contains three sections: [Form Tree View](javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)){:id="a1"}<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a1');
//--></script>,  [Assigned](javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)){:id="a2"}<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a2');
//--></script>,  and [UnAssigned](javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)){:id="a3"}<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a3');
//--></script>.


{:.steps}
To grant groups a version of a form, do the  following:

- Highlight the customized form version in the **Form** tree view section.
- Move the group or groups to be assigned from the  **UnAssigned** section to the **Assigned** section using the arrow keys.



| Arrow Key | Function |
| ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/arrow to left.bmp)  **Single Left Arrow** | Moves a selected group to the section on the left |
| ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/double arrow to left.bmp)  **Double Left Arrow** | Moves all groups to the section on the left |
| ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/arrow to right.bmp)  **Single Right Arrow** | Moves a selected group to the section on the right |
| ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/double arrow to right.bmp)  **Double Right Arrow** | Moves all groups to the section on the right |


- After  the appropriate groups have been assigned to the customized form versions,  click **Save**.



{:.note}
You can also double-click an item to move  it from the **UnAssigned** section  to the **Assigned** section and back  without using the arrows.
