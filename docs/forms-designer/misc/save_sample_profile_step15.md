To save the new profile version (with a missing  mandatory field), do the following:

- From the **Designer**  menu, select **Save**. A **Warning**  dialog box is displayed since a mandatory field is missing.
- Click **OK**  to close the **Warning** dialog box  and return to the Design View.
- In the **Field 
 Chooser**, look for a mandatory field that is highlighted as missing.



{:.note}
In the Field Chooser, a mandatory field is  in bold. A field is highlighted if it is missing from the target form.

- In the **Field 
 Chooser**, click the missing mandatory field. Click the new location  on the target form. The missing mandatory field is now on the target form.
- From the **Designer**  menu, select **Save**. The **Save 
 Form** dialog box is displayed.
- In the **Form Name**  field, type **Item Clerks**.
- Click **OK**.  The form is saved successfully.
- From the **Designer**  menu, select **Exit Design Mode**  to return to the normal mode. The system does not query for a save since  no changes are made since the last save.
- Click **Yes**  to exit the Forms Designer.



You decide to make a few changes to the newly created **Item 
 Clerks** form to make another customized form.
