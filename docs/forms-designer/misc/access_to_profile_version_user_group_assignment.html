<p>After users with the appropriate security rights create customized profiles  and save them, they are known as profile versions. These profile versions  must be assigned to users and groups before they become active. Additional  security rights are needed to assign profile versions. The security right  needed to assign profile versions to users is separate from the security  right needed to assign profile versions to groups.</p>

<p>The users with the appropriate <strong>Assign 
 Forms</strong> security rights can open the assign forms options as listed  in the following table:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Security Right</td>
      <td>Path Activated</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User: Assign Forms</td>
      <td>File &gt; Setup &gt; Assign Forms &gt; Users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User Browser &gt; Options &gt; Forms</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User Profile &gt; Options&gt; Forms</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Assign Forms &gt; Users</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Group: Assign Forms</td>
      <td>File &gt; Setup &gt; Assign Forms &gt; Groups</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Group Browser &gt; Options &gt; Forms</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Group Profile &gt; Options&gt; Forms</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Forms Browser &gt; Options &gt; Assign Forms &gt; Groups</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The distinction between these Assign Forms rights is important because  the user with the Assign Forms right for Groups can quickly make global  changes for groups of users. By separating these rights, the group assignment  form rights can be restricted.</p>
