# Modify a Control or Object


{:.steps}
To change the properties of a control or object using the  Object Inspector, do the following:

- Click on a control or object to view its properties  in the **Object 
 Inspector**.
- Make the necessary changes in the **Object Inspector**.



{:.example}
The following example shows editing the text  control using the Object Inspector:


![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/object inspector editing label add shape control text.gif)


Changes Made in the Object Inspector are shown on the target form.  In  this example, the font color changes to red.


![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/object inspector item profile design mode modify object.gif)


{:.note}
Certain controls change dynamically during  runtime based on **Everest** functionality.  In this situation, the control’s other properties such as Position, Font,  and Color can be changed but the text comes from **Everest**.  For example, you cannot change a Sales Quote caption since the text comes  from **Everest**.
