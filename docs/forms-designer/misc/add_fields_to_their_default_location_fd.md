# Add Fields to their Default Location


{:.steps}
To add fields to their default location on  the target form, do the following:


• Click  on a field or item in the Field Chooser. You will see a **Target**  icon underneath your cursor.


• Press and hold the **Alt** key.  Now the **Target** icon changes to  a **Handbag** icon.

**Handbag Drop Cursor**


• Click a location on the target form. The handbag icon is no longer  underneath your cursor and the field or item is added to the target form  in the default position. You must hold the **Alt** key when you click on the target for this feature to work properly.


You can cut and paste controls or objects to move them easily on the  target form.  The  targeted drop cursor is not available with paste operations. Some controls  or objects can also be copied but you will not be able to copy items that  do not allow duplication. Right click any object to find these options.
