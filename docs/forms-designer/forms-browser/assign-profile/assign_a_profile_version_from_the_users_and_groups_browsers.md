# Assign a Profile Version from the Users and Groups Browsers


When you are managing users and groups from the **Users**  and **Groups** browsers, you can easily  assign and change customized form versions for them.


{:.note}
: Do not assign any forms other than the standard  form to the user with the Forms Designer privilege. This ensures that  all necessary design options are always available to that user.
