<p>The Forms Designer is a utility in <strong>Everest</strong>  used to customize nine profile forms. These profile forms include the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customer Profile</li>
  <li>Vendor Profile</li>
  <li>Item Profile</li>
  <li>Sales Quote</li>
  <li>Sales Order</li>
  <li>Sales Invoice</li>
  <li>Credit Quote</li>
  <li>Credit Order</li>
  <li>Credit Memo</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the power of this customization tool, security features have  been added to the Forms Designer to ensure that only authorized individuals  can complete Forms Designer creation and management tasks. Profiles created  should be consistent with the overall <strong>Everest</strong>  implementation for a business and profiles assigned should be appropriate  for the assigned users and groups.</p>

<p class="note">The Supervisor has global rights and can assign  these rights to another user.</p>

<p>Forms Designer events are logged in the <strong>Everest</strong>  system. Each time a profile version is created, modified, removed or assigned,  an entry is created in the log.</p>

<p>The Forms Designer is a licensed utility and requires a valid key to  install. After installing the Forms Designer, all of the Forms Designer  features, security, and events are activated and are ready for use.</p>
