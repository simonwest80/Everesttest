# Features of Everest Forms Designer


The **Everest Forms Designer**  enables the customization of the following screens:

- Customer Profile
- Vendor Profile
- Item Profile
- Sales Documents (Sales Opportunity/Sales Quote/Sales  Order/Sales Invoice)
- Sales Return Documents (Credit Quote/Credit Order/Credit  Memo)
- Purchase Documents (Purchase Quote/Purchase Order/Purchase  Receipt/Purchase Invoice)
- Purchase Return Documents (Debit Quote/Debit Order/Debit  Memo)
- Document Aliases
- Custom Fields Profile (**Ctrl 
 + F from** an available browser)



You can create different **Custom 
 Fields** profiles for each browser type where it is available. Â Customized  **Custom Field** profiles are available  for a variety of browsers including Sales Documents, Purchase Documents,  Customer, Vendor, User, Item, and Serial Numbers. This allows you to view  extended information from the **Everest**  browsers. Customized **Custom Fields**  profiles created through a sales document will display when accessed from  all sales document browsers. Likewise, a customized **Custom 
 Fields** profile designed for a purchase document displays when accessed  from all purchase documents.


The **Everest Forms Designer**  allows the authorized user to execute the following functions:

- [Create Customized Profiles]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/forms-designer/create-customized-profiles/create_customized_profiles.html)
- Assign  Customized Profiles to Users
- Assign  Customized Profiles to Groups
- [Import a Form Version]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/forms-browser/importing_a_form_version.html)
- [Export a Form Version]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/forms-browser/exporting_a_form_version.html)



To ensure that you will retain your previously designed forms,  you can export your customized form versions prior to an upgrade and then  import them, if necessary, into your new version of **Everest**.  You can also import customized form versions to update the existing form  version.
