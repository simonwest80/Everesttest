# Modifying Reports


System reports can be customized to meet your needs. You can modify  the look of the **Reports Parameter**  dialog box or the report altogether.


The **Reports Parameter** dialog  box can be modified using the Report Manager module. However, to modify  the report, you need to use the Business Objects Crystal Reports Designer.
