# Running Report from a Server (Remote Location)


The **Global Repository** (path:  **Reports** > **Reports 
 Manager** > **Repository**  folder > **Global Repository**)  by default displays all the reports on the report server. These reports  are available to all the users.


{:.note}
When you run any report from the **Global 
 Repository**, it runs from the report server and NOT from your local  machine.


To access reports much faster, it is ideal to have the database server  and the report server on the same machine.
