# Disable Batches


You can disable a report batch from the **Reports 
 Manager** window.


{:.note}
Selecting the **Disable** option  from the right-click menu can also disable individual reports of a report  batch.


Whenever a batch is disabled, it is deactivated and you cannot **Run** or **Schedule**  the batch.


{:.steps}
To disable the report batch, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Reports** >  **Reports** **Manager**.  You will see the **Reports** **Manager** window.
- From the **Reports** **Manager**  window, select a report batch under the ![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/rm_report_batch.gif) folder and select  **File** > **Report****Batch** > **Disable**.  The report batchâ€™s reminder is disabled; it does not remind you to run  the report batch again.
