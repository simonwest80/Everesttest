# Creating Reports


The **Reports Manager** allows you  to build the user interfaces. Newly created reports, not internal reports,  can be viewed in the Reports menu under their respective menu categories.


![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Create  a report under the category "Accounting". This report is displayed  under **Reports** > **Accounting**  in **Everest**.


To run reports, created or modified, you must register them.


{:.hint}
It is mandatory  to register all the reports that are created or modified using **Reports 
 Manager**.

{:.note}
- You cannot associate  more than one .czr file to a .rpt file. If you do so, all the .czr files  will yield the same report using the same parameters.
- You cannot use  parameters in a .czr file, which differ from those in a .rpt file. If  you try to change the parameters for the .czr file and run the report,  the system generates an error and the report is not processed.
- You cannot create  a new report in [Report Batches]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/manager/window/report-batches/report_batches.html). You can  only add existing reports to a batch of reports.
