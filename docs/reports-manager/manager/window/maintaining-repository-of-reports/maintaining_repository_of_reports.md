# Reports Repository 


A reports repository is a location where all the reports are maintained  in an organized manner.


{:.note}
This repository is accessible to the users.

- **Everest**  reports are stored in the reports repository.
- You can add  repositories to **Reports Manager**,  on any client machine. The files and folders in a repository are shown  in the tree-view in the [left  panel]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/manager/window/report_manager_graphic_user_interface.html).
- You must store  all repository paths in **Everest**  in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths, so that the reports are shared  on the network.



{:.note}
In a network, the UNC (Universal Naming Convention)  is a method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer, without  having to specify the storage device it is on.


There are two types of repositories in **Reports 
 Manager**:

- [Global  Repository]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/manager/window/maintaining-repository-of-reports/global_repository.html)
- [Local  Repository]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/manager/window/maintaining-repository-of-reports/local_repository.html)
