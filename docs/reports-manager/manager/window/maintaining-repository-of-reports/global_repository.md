# Global Repository


The default reports are stored in the **Global 
 Repository**. The reports are classified under the following categories:

- Account
- E-Commerce
- Finance
- Internal
- Inventory
- Invoice
- Masters
- Miscellaneous
- Purchase
- Payroll
- TCS  (Time Clocking System)



Any client accessing the database server can by default see this repository  in the **Reports Manager**.


These reports are automatically copied on to a secure system (ideally  the system on which the **Everest** database  is set up).
