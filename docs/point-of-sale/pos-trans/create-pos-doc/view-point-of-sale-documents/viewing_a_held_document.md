- From the **POS Cash Registers** browser (path: **Invoicing &gt; Point of Sale**), select  **Options &gt; Document &gt; Sales &gt; 
 Held Documents**. The **Point 
 of Sale - Held Sales Documents** browser is displayed.

You can also view a Point of Sale (credit  memo) document on hold from the **Point 
 of Sale - Held Sales Documents** browser (path: **Invoicing 
 &gt; Point of Sale &gt;** **Options 
 &gt; Document &gt; Credits &gt; Held Documents**)**.**


If you have set the preference **Force
