<p>When an item that does not exist in the database is sold on behalf of  a third party, you can force a sale in a Point of Sale transaction.</p>

<p>In this case, enter/scan an item code that is non-serialized into the  <strong>Point of Sale (sales invoice)</strong>  document and change the item type for a force sale by clicking in the  <strong>Type</strong> column for the line item  and pressing the <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Spacebar</strong> keys. The <img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/pos_force_sale_icon.gif" alt="" /> icon  appears in the <strong>Type</strong> column, indicating  that it is a force sale.</p>

<p>You can view details of items sold through a ‘force sale’  from the Store Closing report (path: <strong>POS 
 Cash Registers</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Store Closing Reports</strong>).</p>
