# Return Process (Point of Sale)


The **Return Process**  option (path: **Options** > **Return Process**) allows you to process  returns on the POS document. This option allows you two further options:


1. [Return]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/return_process_return_point_of_sale_pos.html)


2. [Return  with Gift Receipt]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/return_process_return_with_gift_receipt_point_of_sale_pos.html)


The system supports returns and exchanges, both when the  new purchase is greater than the total value of the items being returned  and when the return value is less than the new purchase.

- If the items being  returned are less than the items being purchased, then the system will  save the transaction as a sales invoice.
- If the items being  returned are greater than or equal to the items being purchased, the system  saves the invoice as a credit memo. The system will automatically convert  the invoice to the required document (credit memo or sales invoice).
