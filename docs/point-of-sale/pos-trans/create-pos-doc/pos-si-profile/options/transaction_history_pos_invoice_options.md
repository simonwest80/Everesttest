# Transaction History


**Everest** records the history  of a transaction. The **Transaction History**  browser displays the following:

- Details of  a Point of Sales (sales invoice) document such as date and time of creation,  amount of document, user who created the invoice, when the cash drawer  was opened, and the profit made on all the items on the document.
- Details of  payments or deposits received and refunded on the document such as the  payment type and reference number. Details of payments that are applied  to the document are also displayed.
- If payment  is received or refunded through a credit card, the card number, address  verification details, batch processing details and the authorization responses  are also displayed.



You can print the information available in the **Transaction 
 History** browser or opt to export the data to an Excel, HTML, XML  or text file.


To maintain transaction history for documents, you must select the option  **Maintain transaction history for documents**  in the [**Documents** dialog box]({{site.bp_chm}}/misc/transaction_history_others_tab_misc_tab_flow_control_set_up_dialog_box_business_processes.html) (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt;Flow Control
