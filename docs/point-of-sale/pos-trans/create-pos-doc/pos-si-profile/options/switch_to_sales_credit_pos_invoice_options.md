# Switch to Sales Credit


You can toggle between a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document and a Point of Sale (credit memo) document by selecting the option **Switch to Sales Credit**. A Point of Sale (credit memo) document is used to return goods to a customer during a Point of Sale transaction. However, you cannot select this option, if you have already added an item to the Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.
