# Sales Order


This option gives two further options:

- Open
- Convert to Invoice.



**Sales Order > Open**


Select this option to open an existing sales order for display  in the POS profile. You can also change the document type by selecting  another alias for the document.


{:.steps}
To select another alias for sales order,  do the following:

- Click the Sales  Order ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/so_icon_pos.gif) Â icon  to open the **Document** **Aliases**  browser.
- Select another  document alias and click **OK**. The  selected document alias displays.



{:.example}
Customer Pick Up orders can be saved and tracked  differently than special orders that need to be shipped to the customer  when the product arrives. The system displays the default document type  set in the preferences (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Document 
 Alias**).


**Sales Order > Convert to Invoice**


Select this option to convert a sales order into a sales  invoice from the POS profile.


{:.example}
A customer places an order for an item on  the **Everest eStorefront**. The order  is saved as a sales order. The customer later comes over to the POS counter  to pick up the item. You can open the sales order from your POS profile  (**Options** > **Sales****Order** > **Open**),  process the order and convert the order to a POS invoice (**Options**  > **Sales Order** > **Convert 
 to Invoice**).


{:.note}
Shipment confirmation messages or e-mails  are not triggered from the Processes / Activities browser when a sales  order is converted to an invoice using the POS interface, even when this  activity is set up (path: **CRM**  > **Business Activity Monitoring**  > **Processes / Activities**).
