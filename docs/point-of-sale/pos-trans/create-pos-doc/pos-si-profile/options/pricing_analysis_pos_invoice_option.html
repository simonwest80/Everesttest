<h1 id="pricing-analysis">Pricing Analysis</h1>

<p>Pricing analysis is mainly for sales representatives to evaluate what  would be the ideal price to sell the products. Pricing analysis and commissions  for sales representatives are closely interrelated and <strong>Everest</strong>  warns you if the cost for commission calculation is different from the  cost setting for pricing analysis defined in <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> preferences.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pricing Analysis</strong> option  (path: <strong>Point of Sale (sales invoice)</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Pricing Analysis</strong>) provides the sales  department with instant and accurate profit margin calculations for the  entire document. You can view the sales price of an item at progressively  increasing rates of margin or mark-up in the <strong>Pricing 
 Analysis</strong> browser.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pricing Analysis</strong> browser  displays profits for all the items contained in the document at the current  selling price based on different cost computations such as average cost,  last cost, user-defined cost, and actual/average cost. You can choose  the best selling price suitable to you and your customer and click <strong>Apply</strong> to change the selling price of  the item.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to select  the pricing analysis for the entire document:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Profit 
 breakup document</strong> - Displays the pricing analysis statistics and  calculations for the entire document.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Profit 
 breakup current item</strong> - Displays the pricing analysis statistics  and calculations for the selected item.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you select either, the <strong>Profit 
 Breakup</strong> grid displays the pricing analysis and you can choose to  use the <strong>Markup</strong> or <strong>Margin 
 settings</strong> to display the profits. You can also change the markup  or margin setting and click <strong>Apply</strong>  to change the pricing analysis.</p>

<p class="note">The costs are computed per sales measure of the item.</p>
