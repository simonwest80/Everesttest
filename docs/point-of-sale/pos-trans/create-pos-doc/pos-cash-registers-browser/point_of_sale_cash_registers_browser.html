<p>The <strong>POS Cash Registers</strong> browser  displays all available cash registers based on the following order of  precedence:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash 
 register assigned to the logged in user</strong> - If the logged in user  is assigned a cash register, only that cash register is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If the cash register assigned to the logged in user  belongs to a location/sub-location other than the login location/sub-location,  it is NOT displayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User’s 
 Location/Sub-Location-</strong> If no cash register is assigned to the logged  in user, cash registers that belong to the user’s location/sub-location  in the <strong>User</strong> profile and cash registers  that are NOT assigned to any location/sub-location are displayed.</li>
  <li><strong>Login 
 Location/Sub-Location</strong>- If  no  cash register is assigned to the logged in user and the user is not assigned  to a location/sub-location, cash registers assigned to the login location/sub-location  and cash registers NOT assigned to any location/sub-location are displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can assign a cash register to the logged in user  in the <strong>Cash Register</strong> field of  the <strong>User</strong> profile (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Users &gt; Users &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab).</p>

<p>You can assign a location/sub-location to the logged  in user, in the <strong>Location/Sub-Location</strong> field of the <strong>User</strong> profile  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Users &gt; 
 Users &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab).</p>
