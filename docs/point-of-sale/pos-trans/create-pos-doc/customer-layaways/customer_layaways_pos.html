<p>In customer layaways, the customer reserves one or more items from your  store by paying an initial amount as a guarantee. The balance is paid  later. Layaway items are released to the customer when they are paid for  in full.</p>

<p>Layaways are handled in <strong>Everest</strong>  through sales orders and POS.</p>
