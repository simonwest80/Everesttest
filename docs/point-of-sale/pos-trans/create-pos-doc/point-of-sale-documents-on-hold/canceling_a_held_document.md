# Cancel a Held Document


A **Point** **of 
 Sale** (sales invoice) document that has been put on hold can be  cancelled from the **Sales Orders** browser  (path: **Invoicing &gt; Sales Orders**).  You need to identify the number of the held document from the **POS 
 Cash Registers** browser. You can then search for that document in  the **Sales Orders** browser and cancel  it.

You can cancel a **POS Credit** document  that has been put on hold from the **Credit 
 Orders** browser (path: **Invoicing** > **Credit Orders**).
