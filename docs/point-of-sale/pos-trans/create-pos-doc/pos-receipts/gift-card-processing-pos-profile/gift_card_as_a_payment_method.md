# Gift Card as a Payment Method


You can receive payments using a gift card from the Point  of Sale profile.


{:.note}
A license is required to process gift cards.  Since a Gift Card license is not a user-based license, only one license  is needed for the entire company. The Gift Card feature is available in  the Sample Company and in evaluation mode.
