<p>The <strong>Use Prior Authorization</strong>  option in the <strong>Card Verification</strong>  dialog box is used for processing payments on cards which are pre-authorized.  Upon fulfillment of the order, when the payment becomes due, the amount  for which prior authorization are obtained must be processed to capture  funds. In a Point of Sale scenario, this option is used primarily for  customer layaway transactions, where the customer reserves one or more  items from your store. Usually such customers pay an initial amount as  a guarantee that they will return later and pay for the items.</p>
