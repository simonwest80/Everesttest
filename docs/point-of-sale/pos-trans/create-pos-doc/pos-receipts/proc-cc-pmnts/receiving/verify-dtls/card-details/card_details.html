<dl>
  <dt><strong>Card Number and Expiration</strong></dt>
  <dd>The default card number for the customer that is  specified in the <strong>Customer</strong>’s profile  is displayed in this field.</dd>
  <dt>If the customer’s card is swiped, the card number, its  expiry date and the cardholder’s name appear by default in the **Card </dt>
  <dt> Verification** dialog box. If the card is not swiped using a swipe  machine, all these details must be entered manually.</dt>
  <dd>When you process a credit card payment through a  Point of Sale (sales invoice) document, <strong>Everest</strong>  keeps a history of the credit cards used and related information making  it easier for accessing the cards during repeat orders. When you enter  the card number in the <strong>Payment Details</strong>  dialog box, the information pertaining to the expiry date, the cardholder  name, address and zip code are automatically displayed.</dd>
  <dd>The cards used by a particular customer can be viewed  from the <strong>Customer</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Invoicing &gt; Customers &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>) by clicking the look up button beside  the <strong>Default Credit Card Number</strong>  field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Card Holder</strong></dt>
  <dd>The cardholder’s name is automatically displayed  when the card is swiped using a swipe machine or if an existing card number  is selected. If you enter the credit card number manually, you have to  enter this information manually.</dd>
  <dt><strong>CVV2</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field allows you to enter the card verification  value which in combination with the credit card number, makes a credit  card unique. The card verification value refers to the last three or four  numbers that appear on the reverse side of your credit card, right after  your card number.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">Verification of the card verification value (CVV2) is  useful only for transactions where the cardholder is not present. In Point  of Sale transactions, the cardholder is physically present; therefore,  it is not necessary to check for the card verification value.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Address and Zip</strong></dt>
  <dd>When you process a credit card payment for a customer  and a new card number is entered or the credit card is swiped, the customer’s  default address of AVS is displayed in this field by default.</dd>
  <dd>The credit card address that appears depends on  the type of address specified in the <strong>Credit 
 Card</strong> profile (path: <strong>Customer</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Payment Information</strong>  tab) or the type of address specified in the <strong>Default 
 Address for AVS</strong>field of the <strong>Documents</strong>  dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Others</strong> &gt; <strong>Others 
 2</strong> tab). This address may be modified.</dd>
  <dd>When the payment is processed, the card details  (other than the card verification value) are saved and updated for the  customer for that credit card in <strong>Everest</strong>.</dd>
