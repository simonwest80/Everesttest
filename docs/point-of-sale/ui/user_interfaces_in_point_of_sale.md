# User Interfaces in Point of Sale


The Point of Sale invoicing system is designed for touch screen compatibility.  The user interface facilitates the following:

- Speed of operations.
- Minimal orientation  - The employees manning Point of Sale counters are often part timers or  temporary personnel. Hence, the invoice screen is as user-friendly and  simple as possible.
- Minimization  of mistakes and errors, especially while handling cash.
