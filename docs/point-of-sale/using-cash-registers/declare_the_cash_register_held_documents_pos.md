# Declare the Cash Register – Held Documents


You can declare the cash register to reconcile collections  and decide to close or retain the held documents.


{:.steps}
To close Held Documents while declaring the  cash register, do the following:

- Select the cash  register from the Cash Registers browser (path: **Invoicing**  > **Point of Sale** > **Cash Registers** browser). Select **Declare** from the right-click menu.
- Specify your collections  in the **Balance Declaration** dialog  box and click **OK**.
- Click the **Reconcile** button in the **Mark 
 Reconciliation** dialog box. The **Confirm**  dialog box gives options to close or retain the held documents.
- Click **Yes**  to close the held documents. The system closes the held documents and  these are saved in the Sales Orders browser (path: **Invoicing**  > **Sales Orders**. Click **Shipped Sales** **Orders**  button).



To retain the held documents without closing them:

- Click **No**  in the **Confirm** dialog box. The  system continues to retain the held documents and declares the cash register.  The held documents are displayed in the **Held 
 Documents** browser (path: Options > **Document**  > **Open Held Document** from the  POS profile).
