# Profit Breakup Current Item


The **Profit Breakup Current Item**  option allows you to view the expected selling price for the item at different  rates of mark up or margin.


From the **Pricing Analysis** browser,  click the item for which the breakup is required. Select whether the analysis  is by mark up or margin.


The starting rate for analysis and the step up value for subsequent  rates are set up in the **Pricing Analysis**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Pricing Analysis**). You can modify  these.

The cost used for analysis is the cost displayed in the selected row


![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the pricing analysis displayed is for all costs, and you select the item  from the last cost analysis, the profit breakup uses the last cost of  the item. If you select the item from the actual cost analysis, the profit  breakup uses the actual cost of the item.


Select a row and click **Apply**  to use the selected selling price in the document.
