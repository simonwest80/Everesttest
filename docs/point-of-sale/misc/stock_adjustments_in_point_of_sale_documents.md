# Stock Adjustments in Point of Sale Documents


If a Point of Sale customer brings in an item for billing, but the system  stock status of the item in the default stock area does not show that  this quantity is available, you will have to make stock adjustments before  invoicing the item. If the item is a non-serialized item, **Everest**  allows you to make such adjustments on the fly.


If the quantity entered or scanned in exceeds the available stock, then  **Everest** displays a confirmation  dialog box. This dialog box allows you to either:

- [Select  another stock area]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/select_another_stock_area_stock_adjustment_pos_invoice.html)



**OR**

- [Add  quantity]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/add_quantity_stock_adjustment_pos_doc.html)
