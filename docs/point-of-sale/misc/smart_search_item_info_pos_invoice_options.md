# Smart Search


This option allows you to search for an item and add it to the Point  of Sale document.


You can search for an item based on the item code, model, item alias,  serial # and manufacturer’s serial #.


The ‘Search’ dialog box is displayed as the user enters a character  in the **Item Code** column of the **** Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.  This dialog box displays the different types of matches for the item code  you have typed in the **Search for**  field. The search sequence is based on the search method specified in  flow control preferences for items defined in the **Items**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Items**).


{:.example}
If you select serial #, model and item alias  as the search sequence in the **Items**  dialog box, the search displays matching codes if any, in the same order.  It first lists all serial numbers with the matching code, then it will  list all models with the matching code and finally it will list all item  aliases with the matching code.


{:.steps}
