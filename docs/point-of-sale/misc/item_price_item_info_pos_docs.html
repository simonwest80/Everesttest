<p>The selling price of an item is the base price at which the item is  sold to the customer. The difference between the cost of the item (<strong>actual cost</strong> in case of <strong>serialized 
 inventory</strong> and <strong>average cost</strong>  in case of <strong>non-serialized inventory</strong>)  and the selling price of the item is the profit.</p>

<p>Negative Pricing</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to enter  negative prices for non-inventoried items. Negative pricing is used to  account for discount coupons that are offered to customers in a Point  of Sale transaction.</p>

<p class="example">You may give discount coupons to customers who purchase  more than $100 worth of goods.</p>

<p class="steps">To enter negative prices, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an item  with ‘Discount Coupons’ as the item code. The item should be a non-inventoried  type of item.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the item  code/scan the item in the <strong>Point of Sale 
 (sales invoice)</strong> profile.</li>
  <li>Enter a negative  value in the <strong>Price</strong> column. The  system automatically calculates the total price on the document after  taking the discount value into consideration.</li>
