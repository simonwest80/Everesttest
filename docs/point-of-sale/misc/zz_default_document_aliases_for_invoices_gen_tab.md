**Specify a default document  alias for all sales made through the specific cash register in a Point  of Sale transaction. Document aliases are defined in the **Document

You can have separate cash registers for the sale of  different lines of products like perfumes, books etc. You can then specify  a document alias called ‘POS Invoice - Books’ for the particular cash  register.
