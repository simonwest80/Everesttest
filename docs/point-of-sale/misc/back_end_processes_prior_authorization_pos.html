<p>When prior authorization for a credit card payment is obtained, the  following back-end processes occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a response  is received from the processing network, the authorization details no  longer appear in the <strong>Batch Credit Card 
 Processing</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>The back-end  processes for approved payments are the same as when payment is made through  cash, check or other methods.</li>
</ul>
