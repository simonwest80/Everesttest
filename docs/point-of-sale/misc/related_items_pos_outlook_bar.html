<p>Related items represent items that can be sold or purchased as substitutes  or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item.</p>

<p>Upgrading an item can be defined as selling/purchasing an enhanced version  of an existing product.</p>

<p>Downgrading an item can be defined as selling /purchasing a product  that has fewer features than an existing product.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define multiple  upgrades or downgrades for an item.</li>
  <li>Specify Price  Differentials for the upgrades or downgrades (indicate a fixed price or  a formula as the upgrade price, that will enable you to arrive at a new  price for the upgraded item).</li>
  <li>Assign upgrades/downgrades  and their price differentials to specific item kits.</li>
</ul>
