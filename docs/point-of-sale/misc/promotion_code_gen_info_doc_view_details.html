<p>Promotions or promotional campaigns are used to increase your sales.  You can offer discounts or free items with the purchase an item for a  certain period to attract more customers.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/point-of-sale/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  a customer buys a DiMAGE Z3 Digital Camera, you can offer another DiMAGE  Z3 Digital Camera for free. This offer can be valid only for a certain  period, for instance, the Holiday season.</p>

<p>Promotion codes are also used in Point of Sale documents to keep track  of revenues that occur because of promotion campaigns. You may also want  to track the source of a sale based on promotion codes for the following  reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To compute  the profits of printing a promotion campaign catalog.</li>
  <li>To gauge the  effectiveness of advertising and campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<p>A promotional code is defined in the <strong>Promotion</strong> <font color="#000000" class="hcp3">profile</font>  (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Discounts &gt; 
 Promotions</strong> &gt; <strong>Options &gt; Edit

 Code Required</strong> check box and specifying a promotion code in the  <strong>Promotion</strong> field of the <strong>Special 
 Pricing</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>Inventory 
 &gt; Discounts &gt; Special Pricing &gt;</strong> <strong>Options

  <li><strong>Update prices based on the new promotion</strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp3"> - If you select this option, the price specified in

 Pricing</strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp3"> dialog box, for the particular
