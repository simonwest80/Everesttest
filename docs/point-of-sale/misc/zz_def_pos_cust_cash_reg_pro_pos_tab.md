title: Default POS Customer
---


If it is required to record the sale transaction in the same currency  as the payment currency, you can set up different POS counters for each  currency that you accept. In such cases, you can specify a default POS  customer for each cash register. The drop-down list displays all customers  created in **Everest**. If you leave  this field blank, the **Customers**  browser is displayed when you create a POS invoice.
