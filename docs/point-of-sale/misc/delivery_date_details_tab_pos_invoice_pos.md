# Delivery Date


The **Delivery Date** field in a  sales quote or a sales order allows you to specify the date of expected  delivery of the shipment to the customer's address. When a document is  created, by default the **Delivery Date**  field displays the current system date. If required, you can modify the  delivery date.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana"> </font>The  delivery date on orders helps plan management of inventories.


The delivery date on a sales invoice identifies the date on which the  items were actually shipped, as there could be a time lag between the  date on which the items were issued and the date on which the sales invoice  was created.


When you convert a sales quote to a sales order or a sales order to  a sales invoice, the following will occur:

- The converted  sales order displays the login  date, if the delivery date on the sales quote is blank.
- The converted  sales order displays the date specified on the sales quote, if a delivery  date has been specified in the sales quote.
