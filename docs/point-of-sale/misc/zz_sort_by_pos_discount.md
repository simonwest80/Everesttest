title: Sort By

Specify whether the report should be sorted by the item code or the  sales representative. If you select Item  Code, all Point of Sale documents are grouped by the items they  contain. If a document has more than one item, the document details are  displayed separately for each line item. Similarly, if you select **Sales Rep**, the documents are grouped  by the sales representatives who created them.
