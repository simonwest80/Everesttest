title: View balance and change due in any currency
---


Select this check box to view the balance amount and change due in multiple  currencies. After a part of the amount is paid in a particular currency,  the balance amount can be viewed in another currency. Further, after making  payment in a particular currency, you can view the amount of change due  in another currency. The **Balance In**  or **Change In** fields are displayed  if the above option is selected.


If the payment amount is less than or equal to the document total, you  will see the **Balance in** field  and if the payment amount is more than the document total, you will see  the **Change in** field. By default,  the **Balance in** field displays  the amount in document currency.


**Everest** displays the change  due through an information window both in the base currency as well as  in the currency selected for change due.


This field is enabled only when you select the **Allow 
 split payments in multiple currencies** option.


{:.note}
If different payment currencies are used, different transaction are  created. But if different payment methods are used, then different journals  are created for each payment method, provided the associated bank account  is different for each method.
