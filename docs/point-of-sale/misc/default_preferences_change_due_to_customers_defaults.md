# Default Preferences - Change Due to Customers


In a Point of Sale scenario there may be instances when a customer pays  more than the amount that appears on the Point of Sale (sales invoice)  document. The cashier at the Point of Sale terminal has to refund the  change due to the customer.


To specify the default payment method to be used for change due to customers,  you have to set the preference by checking the **Default 
 Payment Method for Change Due** field in the following dialog boxes:

- **Cash 
 Register** profile (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Miscellaneous**  > **Cash Register** > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window**)
- **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation** **Settings**  > **General** > **Others**  tab)
- **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting**  > **Miscellaneous** tab)
