<h1 id="exchange-rate">Exchange Rate</h1>

<p>The <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field displays  the conversion rate of the foreign currency to your base currency.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> determines whether the  Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on the setting in the <strong>Rate for Sales Documents</strong> field (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency &gt; Exchange Rates</strong>).</p>

<p>If the exchange rate for the document is different from the current  rate, you can change the rate.</p>

<p class="example">If a sale from a foreign customer is covered by a fixed  rate contract (where you contract to buy the foreign exchange at a specified  rate) the exchange rate for the document is the one defined in the contract.</p>

<p>Exchange rates can be entered with up to six decimals.</p>
