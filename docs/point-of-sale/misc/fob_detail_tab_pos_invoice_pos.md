# Free on Board (FOB)


The **FOB** (Free on Board) field  identifies the physical location (the place) where the title of the items  is transferred to the buyers and the party responsible for payment of  freight.


The commonly used terms to indicate the transfer of the title and payables  are:

- **FOB 
 Origin** - Indicates that the buyer takes over the title of the goods,  the moment the carrier signs the bill of lading. The buyer is responsible  for the payment of freight.
- **FOB 
 Destination** - Indicates that the seller retains title to the goods  until the goods are delivered to the buyer. The seller is responsible  for the payment of freight.



Some of the common variations of FOB are listed below:


| **FOB** | **Description** |
| FOB Origin Freight Collect | Buyer pays and bears the freight charges. |
| FOB Origin Freight Prepaid | Seller pays and bears the freight charges. |
| FOB Origin Freight Prepaid and Add | Seller pays and then invoices the buyer for freight  charges. |
| FOB Destination Freight Collect | Buyer pays and bears the freight charges. |
| FOB Destination Freight Prepaid | Seller pays and bears the freight charges. |
| FOB Destination Freight Collect and Allow | Buyer pays freight charges but deducts the amount from  the sellerâ€™s invoice. |
| FOB Destination Freight Prepaid and Add | Seller pays and adds the freight charges to the invoice. |
