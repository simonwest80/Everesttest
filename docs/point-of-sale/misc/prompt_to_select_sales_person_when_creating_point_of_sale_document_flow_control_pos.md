# Prompt to select sales person when creating point of sale document


You may need to keep track of the sales representative responsible for  each sale, through your point of sale counter. This option allows you  to automatically display the **Select Sales 
 Person** dialog box when a point of sale document is saved. If you  do not select this option, the **Sales 
 Representative** field on the Point of Sale document displays the  logged in user/the customerâ€™s sales representative or is left blank.
