title: Exclude Already Reduced Items
---


Select this check box so as not to apply the discount specified in the  **Discount** field to the following:

- An item that already  has a discount specified.
- A line item whose  price is less than the price specified in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Items** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Sales** tab).



{:.note}
If the price of a line item is less than the  price specified in the **Item** profile,  global discount is still applied even if this check box is selected. It  is excluded only if the price is changed manually.
