# Profit Breakup Document


The **Profit Breakup Document**  option displays a cumulative profit analysis for all the items included  in the analysis. The costs of the items are totaled and the cumulative  selling price calculated for the required markup or margin percentage.


The starting rate for analysis and the step up value for subsequent  rates are set up in the **Pricing Analysis**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Pricing Analysis**). You can modify  these.

To select the type of cost to be used in the analysis, select any row  for the appropriate cost group and then click the **Profit 
 Breakup Document** button.


{:.note}
If the selected row is from the last cost analysis,  the profit breakup uses the last cost of the items. If you select the  row from the actual cost analysis, the profit breakup uses the actual  cost of the items.


From the **Pricing Analysis** browser,  select a row and click **Apply**,  **Everest** re-calculates all selling  prices using the mark-up/margin specified for all the items in the document.


Selling prices selected must fulfill the minimum/critical markup/margins  specified.
