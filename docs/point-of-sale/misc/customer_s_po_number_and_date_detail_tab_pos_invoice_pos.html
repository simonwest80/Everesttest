<h1 id="customers-po-number-and-date">Customer’s PO Number and Date</h1>

<p>The <strong>Customer’s</strong> <strong>PO 
 No.</strong> field displays the number of the customer’s purchase order  that links the sales order with the customer’s order. This helps you track  the sales order to the copy of the customer’s order. If a PO number has  been duplicated for a customer, <strong>Everest</strong>  displays the <strong>Confirm</strong> window. Click  <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm that you want to  use the same PO number again. Click <strong>No</strong>  to enter another PO number.</p>

<p class="note">You can set a preference by selecting the option <strong>Prompt for duplicate PO number from the same 
 customer</strong> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts &gt; Sales 
 Document &gt; Sales Document 2</strong> tab) to display a message if the  PO number entered (in the new sales document) has been already been entered  in another sales order for the same customer. This helps to avoid duplication  of sales documents for a customer.</p>

<p>Enter the number of the customer’s  purchase order in the <strong>Date</strong> field.</p>
