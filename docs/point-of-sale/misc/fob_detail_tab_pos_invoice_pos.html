<p>The <strong>FOB</strong> (Free on Board) field  identifies the physical location (the place) where the title of the items  is transferred to the buyers and the party responsible for payment of  freight.</p>

<p>The commonly used terms to indicate the transfer of the title and payables  are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>FOB 
 Origin</strong> - Indicates that the buyer takes over the title of the goods,  the moment the carrier signs the bill of lading. The buyer is responsible  for the payment of freight.</li>
  <li><strong>FOB 
 Destination</strong> - Indicates that the seller retains title to the goods  until the goods are delivered to the buyer. The seller is responsible  for the payment of freight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the common variations of FOB are listed below:</p>
