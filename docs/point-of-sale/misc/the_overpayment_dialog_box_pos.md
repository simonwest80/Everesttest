# The Overpayment Dialog Box


When a customer makes an overpayment, you can specify that amount here.  The change due to the customer is shown in the **Change 
 In** field in the documentâ€™s currency. **Everest**  displays the **Overpayment** dialog  box as you click **OK**.


This dialog box has two options:

- **Give 
 the Customer &lt; &nbsp;&gt; 
 Change** - This option allows you to return the change due to the  customer. When you click **OK**, the  change due is displayed after the POS processing is complete.



{:.note}
If your preferences are set to print receipts (path:  **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Flow Control** > **Documents** > **Miscellaneous**  tab > **Others** tab > **Others 1** tab - **Auto-print 
 invoice in point of sale document** selected), the receipt prints  before the change due is displayed.

- **Apply 
 the overpayment as a customer deposit** - This option allows you  to apply the overpayment as a customer deposit. **Everest**  credits the Customer Deposit Account specified in your **Accounting 
 Defaults** (path: **File** >  **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting**  > **Control Accounts** tab) with  the amount of overpayment. The POS internal report displays this amount  as a credit to the customer.
