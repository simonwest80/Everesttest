# Exchange Rate


The **Exchange Rate** field displays  the conversion rate of the foreign currency to your base currency.


**Everest** determines whether the  Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on the setting in the **Rate for Sales Documents** field (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency &gt; Exchange Rates**).


If the exchange rate for the document is different from the current  rate, you can change the rate.


{:.example}
If a sale from a foreign customer is covered by a fixed  rate contract (where you contract to buy the foreign exchange at a specified  rate) the exchange rate for the document is the one defined in the contract.


Exchange rates can be entered with up to six decimals.
