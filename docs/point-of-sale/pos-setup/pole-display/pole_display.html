<p>A pole display allows you to display messages at cash counters in department  stores, supermarkets, etc.</p>

<p class="example">You can display a ‘Welcome’ message when the customer  enters, and a ‘Visit Again’ message on the customer’s exit.</p>

<p>A pole display also displays the item code, the price and the value  of the bill as the items are entered. This helps the customer know the  value of the items purchased, as they are entered into the system.</p>
