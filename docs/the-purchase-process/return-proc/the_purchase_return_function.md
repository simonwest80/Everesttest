# The Purchase Return Function


The purchase return cycle involves decisions and processes related to vendor returns (returns of defective products bought). For services rendered the vendor has to be debited with the allowance you claim for unsatisfactory service.


**The purchase return function includes the following**:

- Create quotes for items that you intend to return.
- Obtain Vendor Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) to return the items.
- Create debit orders once you obtain the Vendor's RMA.
- Create debit memos for items returned.
- Manage item returns for exchange and repairs.
- Follow-up on open debit orders on which items are yet to be returned.
- Obtain refunds.
- Manage accounts payable.
