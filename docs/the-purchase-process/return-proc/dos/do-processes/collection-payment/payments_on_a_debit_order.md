# Payments on a Debit Order


You may initially accept a refund from your vendor for items that you  return. Later on, you may decide to take another item in exchange for  the returned item. In this case, you would make either a full or partial  payment on the debit order to the vendor.


You can pay your vendor through cash, check, or credit card. A credit  card payment is processed online only when you select the **Use 
 Payment Processor** option (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window** > **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab).

- From the **Debit Order** profile, select **Options**  > **Payment** > **Make 
 Payment**. You will see the [**Payment** dialog box]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/collection-payment/the_payment_dialog_box_debit_order.html).
- Select the  appropriate payment method in the **Payment 
 Method** field.
- Enter the amount  to be paid in the **Amount** field  and click **OK.**
