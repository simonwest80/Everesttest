You can attach serialized inventory only from 'stock' type of stock  areas to a debit order/memo.

 order/memo, do the following:**

- From the **Debit** **Order**/**Debit** **Memo**  profile, select **Options** > **Attach**/**Retrieve****Serial #** > **Mfg. 
 Serial**. You will see the **Retrieve 
 Serial Numbers** dialog box.
- Specify the  manufacturer's serial number of the item in the **Manufacturer's 
 serial #** field **** and click  **Apply**.



You  can also scan the serial numbers into the system using a bar code scanner.

In case the manufacturer's serial number is assigned to more than one  serial number and the item is retrieved into the document using the manufacturer's  serial number, the **Serial Numbers**  browser is displayed. This browser displays a list of serial numbers that  bear the same manufacturer's serial number. Select the required serial  number from this browser.
