# Attach Items to the Debit Order


Inventoried items can be committed to a debit order when:

1. You identify the  items to be returned and move them to a separate area.
- You send items  out for repair or exchange but continue to retain ownership.



You cannot commit items on orders belonging to discontinued vendors.


An entry can be made in the **Committed**  column only for inventoried and serialized items. In the case of a non-inventoried  line item this column displays a cross mark.


Entering the committed quantities for items is classified under:

- [Serialized  Items]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/attaching-items-do/serialized-items/attaching_quantities_committed_on_debit_order_serialized_items.html)
- [Auto-serialized  Items]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/misc/attach_committed_items_auto_serialized_items.html)
- [Non-serialized  Items]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/attaching-items-do/non-ser-items/attaching_quantities_committed_on_debit_order_non_serialized_items.html)
