<p>A debit order is closed either when all items on the order are returned  or when you mark it complete. You can mark an order complete even if the  order contains back ordered items or line items with committed quantities.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Mark Close/Open</strong> toggle  option (path <strong>Debit</strong> <strong>Order</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Process</strong>) to manually mark the debit  order as complete. When you select this option, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you to confirm that the order must be marked complete. Click <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>  as per your requirement.</p>

<p><strong>When you mark an ‘open’ order complete:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The requested quantity  is reduced to zero</li>
  <li>The committed quantity,  if any, is detached</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you mark a ‘backorder’ complete:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The requested quantity  is reduced to the quantity debited (on partially received line items)</li>
  <li>The committed quantity,  if any, is detached</li>
</ul>
