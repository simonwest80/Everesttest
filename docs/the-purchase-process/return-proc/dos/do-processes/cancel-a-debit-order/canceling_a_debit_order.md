# Cancel a Debit Order


If you do not wish to continue the purchase return process with your  vendor you can cancel the debit order. The debit order is cancelled using  the **Cancel** option (path: **Debit** **Order**  profile > **Options** > **Process** > **Cancel 
 Order**).


The following debit orders cannot be cancelled:

- A debits order  that is a backorder.
- A debit order that  has items committed.
- A 'Closed' debit  order.



When you cancel the debit order, the system converts it to a debit quote.  The debit quote becomes available again as a system document and can be  treated like the normal debit quote.
