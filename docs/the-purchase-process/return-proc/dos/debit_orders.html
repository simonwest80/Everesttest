<p>The debit order is the second document generated in the purchase return  process. The debit order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created  when the items to be returned to a vendor have been identified.</li>
  <li>Identifies  the exact items to be returned or the stock area from which it is to be  returned.</li>
  <li>Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered when assessing free stock).</li>
  <li>Is also used  to record the dispatch of items to a vendor for repairs or replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not mandatory to create the debit order; you can directly create  a debit memo.</p>

<p class="note">The debit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when you create a debit  order.</p>
