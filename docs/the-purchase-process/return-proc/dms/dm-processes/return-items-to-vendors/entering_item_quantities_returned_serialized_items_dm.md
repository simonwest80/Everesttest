# Enter Item Quantities Returned - Serialized Items


In case of serialized and auto-serialized items, you must identify the  serial number of each item that is returned. You can retrieve serial numbers  using any of the following options:

- [Retrieve  Serial Number]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/attaching-items-do/serialized-items/retrieving_individual_serial_numbers_pur_ret_do.html)
- [Serial  Number Range]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/attaching-items-do/serialized-items/retrieving_a_range_of_serial_numbers_pur_ret_do.html)
- [Manufacturer's  Serial Number]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/return-proc/dos/do-processes/attaching-items-do/serialized-items/retrieving_manufacturer_s_serial_number_debit_memo_order_pr_content.html)



If the actual cost of the serial number differs from the return price,  you are prompted on whether you want to attach the serial number to a  new line.


{:.example}
If the price for return of an item is $125  and the actual cost of one of the serial numbers attached is $100, you  may want to add this item as a separate line item.


Before the debit memo is saved, you can detach serial numbers attached  to the memo from the **Serial # for All 
 Items** browser (path: **Debit****Memo** profile > **Options**  > **Show** **All****Serial** **Number**)  by selecting the **De**-**serialize** option.


You can also use the **Detach Serial 
 #** option (path: **Debit Memo**  profile > **Options &gt; Detach Serial 
 #**) to detach serial numbers.


{:.note}
The quantity returned can be more than the  requested quantity.
