<p>The following types of errors may occur in a Debit Memo:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vendor 
 Code</strong> - If you select a wrong vendor code when you create a memo  for serialized items you are prompted with an error message. In case of  non-serialized and non-inventoried items, if a wrong vendor is debited  (but items are correct), you must credit and debit the respective vendor  through a manual purchase journal.</li>
  <li><strong>Return 
 Value</strong> - If the return value entered in the debit memo is incorrect,  you must either debit or credit the vendor through a manual purchase journal  for the difference.</li>
  <li><strong>Item 
 Quantity</strong> - If the item quantity actually returned is less than  what was entered; create an Inventory Adjustment document to add back  the quantity that is not returned to stock. Credit the vendor through  a manual purchase journal.</li>
  <li><strong>Allocation 
 to the wrong cost center</strong> - In this case, create a general journal  entry debiting and crediting the relevant account and selecting the cost  centers to and from which the amount has to be re-allocated.</li>
</ul>
