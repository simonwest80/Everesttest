# Transaction History


**Everest**  records the entire history of a transaction beginning from the inception  (debit quote), order creation, conversion to debit memo, refunds received,  closing of the order, opening of the closed order, payments applied, and  modifications to the document.


You can view the **Transaction****History** browser from any of the  following locations:

- From the Purchase  Return Documents browser by selecting **Options**  > **Transaction** **History**.
- From the Purchase  Return Document profile by selecting **Options**  > **Transaction** **History**.
- From the Purchase  Return Document profile by selecting the **History**  tab.



The **Transaction History** browser  displays the following:

- Details of debit  quote/order/memo creation such as date and time of creation, amount of  document and the user who created the document.
- Details of payments  or deposits made and refunded on the document such as the payment type  and reference number. Details of payments that are applied to the document  are also displayed. Credit card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).
- Details of modifications  made to documents such as changing the status of the debit order, changes  in the vendor contact and shipping addresses, change in the document alias,  pay terms, delivery method, location/sub-location and jurisdiction.
- Displays whether  the transaction status is Normal, Void, Reversed, or Reversal.
