<p>The <strong>Document</strong> # field displays  the number assigned to a purchase return document when it is created.  <strong>Everest</strong> automatically assigns  the next sequence number generated in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile to the next purchase return document created. Sequence numbers  are assigned continuously.</p>

<p>Sequence numbers for purchase return documents are set in the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Purchasing</strong> tab), of the logged in location/sub-location  from which you create the purchase return document.</p>

<p>If a sequence number is not defined for the login location or sub-location,  the sequence number assigned to the <strong>Default 
 Location</strong> (path:<font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana" class="hcp2"> </font><strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> tab)<font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana" class="hcp2"> </font>is assigned to the document.</p>

<p>Numbering Document Aliases</p>

<p>Documents created with a different alias  are not assigned a different sequence. The next number in the sequence  is used for all documents of a particular type, irrespective of the document  alias.</p>

<p class="example">If you create a debit quote with the number  1000 and the next debit quote created has an alias ‘Return of Spares’,  the document number for the ‘Return of Spares’ would be 1001.</p>

<p>Manual Numbering</p>

<p>You cannot number the documents manually in <strong>Everest</strong>.  You can however, change the sequence number by changing it from the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong> profile&gt; <strong>Purchasing</strong> tab). Every time you change  a sequence number, <strong>Everest</strong> allots  the next number in sequence to the documents, thereafter.</p>

<p><strong>Processed Documents</strong></p>

<p>If a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to a memo,  and the login location is changed before saving it, the system uses the  sequence number set for the logged-in location even though it is different  from the location on the original quote or order.</p>

<p class="note">Sequence numbers once used cannot be re-used  even if the document has been discontinued or purged.</p>
