# Location/Sub-Location


The **Loc/Sub-Loc** field in a purchase  return document displays the location or the sub-location to which the  document belongs. When a new quote, order or memo is created, the **Loc/Sub-Loc** field displays the login  location/sub-location. You can change the location or sub-location.


When you assign a location or sub-location to the document, you can  keep track of purchase return documents by location/sub-location and print  reports required for management information purposes.


{:.example}
You can generate a report of all debit quotes  raised by the purchase department to review the estimated purchase returns  of the location/sub-location.


Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers


The documentâ€™s location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Locations/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a location/sub-location  is selected, the address and logo of the sub-location's location is used.


Processed Documents


As documents are converted from one type to another (quote, order, memo),  the location/sub-location specified in the original document is carried  throughout. You can change the location/sub-location before posting the  purchase journal for the debit memo.


Different Location/Sub-Location for Vendor and Document


When the location/sub-location assigned to the vendor in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous** tab)  is different from that of the document, **Everest**  prompts you with a message to that effect, asking you whether you want  to change it. You can choose to change the document's location/sub-location  by clicking 'Yes'.


{:.note}
You can set the preference **Allow 
 user to open only those purchasing documents which belong to his/her default 
 location/sub-location** in the **Documents** dialog box **** (path: **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Flow Control** > **Documents** > **Flow** **Control****Setup** > **Miscellaneous** > **Others &gt; Others 2** tab)  to ensure that users are allowed to open only those documents that belong  to the user's location/sub-location.
