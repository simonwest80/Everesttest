    <ul>
      <li>The current exchange rate for the currency is displayed; this can be edited for the document.</li>
      <li>The document can be viewed in either the document’s currency or the base currency.</li>
      <li>The document amounts can be entered in either the base currency or the document currency. When switching to the other currency, then the amounts are translated using the exchange rate defined in the document.</li>
