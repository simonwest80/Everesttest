# Delivery Date


Delivery Date on a Debit Quote or Order


The **Delivery** **Date** field in a debit quote or a debit order allows you to specify the date of expected delivery of the shipment.


The delivery date on orders helps you in planning inventories.


Delivery Date on a Debit Memo


The delivery date on a debit memo identifies the date when the items were actually returned, as there could be a time lag between the time the items were returned and the date when the debit memo was created.
