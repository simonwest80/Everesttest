<h1 id="debit-quotes">Debit Quotes</h1>

<p>The debit quote is the first document generated in the purchase return  process. The tentative quantity of the items proposed to be returned,  or the value of services for which the vendor is proposed to be debited,  is recorded in a debit quote.</p>

<p>The information in the debit quote flows into the debit order and from  the debit order to the debit memo. You can directly create the debit order  or the debit memo without creating a debit quote.</p>

<p>Although it is not mandatory to create a debit quote before placing  a debit order, it is preferable to create debit quotes for returns that  require a return merchandise authorization from the vendor.</p>

<p class="note">The debit quote is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when a debit quote is created.</p>
