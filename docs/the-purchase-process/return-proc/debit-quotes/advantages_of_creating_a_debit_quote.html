<h1 id="advantages-of-creating-a-debit-quote">Advantages of Creating a Debit Quote</h1>

<p>The advantages of creating a debit quote are elucidated below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Record 
 vendor negotiations</strong> - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage 
 vendor contacts</strong> - The debit quote is the basis for return negotiations  with the vendor. It helps to retrieve the details of the quote during  conversations or contacts with the vendor. The <strong>Everest</strong>  Contact Manager allows you to associate tasks, appointments and calls  with a specified quote.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimize 
 data entry at the time of creating debit orders</strong> - When a debit  quote is converted to an order, the information in the debit quote flows  into the debit order thus reducing data entry for order creation.</li>
</ul>
