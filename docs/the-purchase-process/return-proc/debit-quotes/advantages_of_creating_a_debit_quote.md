# Advantages of Creating a Debit Quote


The advantages of creating a debit quote are elucidated below:

- **Record 
 vendor negotiations** - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.
- **Manage 
 vendor contacts** - The debit quote is the basis for return negotiations  with the vendor. It helps to retrieve the details of the quote during  conversations or contacts with the vendor. The **Everest**  Contact Manager allows you to associate tasks, appointments and calls  with a specified quote.

- **Minimize 
 data entry at the time of creating debit orders** - When a debit  quote is converted to an order, the information in the debit quote flows  into the debit order thus reducing data entry for order creation.
