# Correcting Errors in Purchase Receipts


The following types of errors may occur in a purchase receipt:

- **Vendor****information** - If you create a  purchase receipt for the wrong vendor, you can create a debit memo to  offset the amount payable or create a manual purchase journal entry debiting  the vendor. You can then create the purchase receipt for the right vendor.
- **Item****cost**/**value**  - If the item cost (for an inventoried item) is incorrect, create a **Cost****Adjustment** document.
- **Item****cost**/**value**  - If the item cost (for a non-inventoried item) is incorrect, create a  debit memo (if the cost is overstated) or a manual purchase journal for  the item (if the value is understated).
- **Item****quantity** - If the item quantity  actually received was less than what was entered, create a debit memo  for the item. If item quantity received was more than what was entered,  create a new purchase receipt for the item.
- **Allocation****to** **the****wrong** **cost****center** - In this case, create  a general journal entry debiting and crediting the relevant account and  selecting the cost centers to and from which the amount has to be re-allocated.
