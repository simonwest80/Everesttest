<p>The following types of errors may occur in a purchase receipt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vendor</strong><strong>information</strong> - If you create a  purchase receipt for the wrong vendor, you can create a debit memo to  offset the amount payable or create a manual purchase journal entry debiting  the vendor. You can then create the purchase receipt for the right vendor.</li>
  <li><strong>Item</strong><strong>cost</strong>/<strong>value</strong>  - If the item cost (for an inventoried item) is incorrect, create a <strong>Cost</strong><strong>Adjustment</strong> document.</li>
  <li><strong>Item</strong><strong>cost</strong>/<strong>value</strong>  - If the item cost (for a non-inventoried item) is incorrect, create a  debit memo (if the cost is overstated) or a manual purchase journal for  the item (if the value is understated).</li>
  <li><strong>Item</strong><strong>quantity</strong> - If the item quantity  actually received was less than what was entered, create a debit memo  for the item. If item quantity received was more than what was entered,  create a new purchase receipt for the item.</li>
  <li><strong>Allocation</strong><strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong><strong>wrong</strong> <strong>cost</strong><strong>center</strong> - In this case, create  a general journal entry debiting and crediting the relevant account and  selecting the cost centers to and from which the amount has to be re-allocated.</li>
</ul>
