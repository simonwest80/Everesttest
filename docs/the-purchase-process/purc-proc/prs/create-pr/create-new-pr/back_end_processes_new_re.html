<ul>
  <li>A purchase  receipt is created with the status ‘open’.</li>
  <li>If the purchase  receipt was created by converting an order, and all items ordered are  both fully received and invoiced, the status of the purchase order changes  to ‘closed’. Otherwise, the purchase order remains open with a received  status (not received, partially received, or fully received) and an invoiced  status (not invoiced, partially invoiced, or fully invoiced).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Serial numbers  of serialized/auto-serialized items - If the item is serialized/auto-serialized,  serial numbers are generated for the quantities received that were not  committed. Serial numbers are assigned when the purchase receipt is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Serial numbers are generated in a series  that starts from the next serial number assigned in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>) for the login  location/sub-location. If the serial number for location of the login  location/sub-location is blank, the next serial number assigned for the  <strong>Default Location</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>) is used.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The average  cost of the item is updated by adding the value of item on the receipt  to the value of total stock in ‘Stock’ type of stock areas and dividing  it by total quantity in stock.</li>
</ul>

<p>Average Cost = (Value of total stock in stock  type of stock areas + Value of items received)/(Existing quantity of total  stock + Quantity received)</p>

<p>Value of item includes freight distributed  to the item. The purchase measure is considered for computing stock for  average cost calculations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The low cost,  high cost and purchase history of the item is also automatically updated.</li>
  <li>When quantities  of an item ordered are received on a purchase receipt, the stock status  of the item displays the following changes:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Item Stock 
 Status</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a  decrease in the quantity of <strong>PO</strong>  for the items received. If the quantity received was committed on order,  the quantity of <strong>PO</strong> <strong>Committed</strong>  reduces.
    <ul>
      <li>There is an  increase in <strong>Total</strong> quantity <em>**</em> of the item.</li>
      <li>There is a  decrease in the <strong>Available</strong> quantity  of the item.</li>
      <li>If receipt was against a <strong>Drop</strong><strong>Shipment</strong> sales order, the items  received are automatically committed to the sales order and the <strong>SO</strong> <strong>Commit</strong>  for the item increases.
