<p>Purchase receipts are recorded in an ‘open’ system purchase journal  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A journal whose  accounting period corresponds to the login date.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same journal group as the one selected in the Workstation Settings  of the user creating the purchase receipt.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location of the  user creating the purchase receipt.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same account for Accrued Purchases Control as the Accrued Purchases  Control account selected in the Accrued Purchases field (path: File &gt;  Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Posting Group profile) of Vendor Posting Group.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such ‘open’ journal exists, a new purchase journal is created.  The purchase journal number for the new journal is taken from the sequence  number for purchase journals for the logged in location/sub-location.</p>

<p>If this number is not assigned, the sequence number assigned to the  <strong>Default Location</strong> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab) is used.</p>
