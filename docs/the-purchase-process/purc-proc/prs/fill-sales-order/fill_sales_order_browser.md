# The Fill Sales Order Browser


The **Fill Sales Order** browser  is displayed once you make the selections and click **OK**  in the **Parts Fulfillment** dialog  box. This browser displays all items on the purchase document. Along with  each item, **Everest** displays customer  sales orders that are open for those items, the quantity the order needs  and how many units can be fulfilled using this purchase.


The **Fill Sales Order** browser  merely provides this information. You must assign the items to the sales  order manually.


The **Sales Measure** column displays  the measure used in the sales document.


The **Purchase Measure** column  displays the measure used in the purchase document.


The **Qty on PR** column displays  the **Received Quantity** on the purchase  receipt. This is displayed when you select **Current 
 Purchase Receipt Quantity** in the **Parts 
 Fulfillment** dialog box. This field is shown in the purchase measure  used in the purchase document.


The **Free Stock** column displays  the free stock available in all the stock areas for the item. This is  displayed when you select **Free****Stock** in the **Parts 
 Fulfillment** dialog box.


The **Qty Needed** and **Can 
 Fill** columns are shown in the sales measure of the sales document.
