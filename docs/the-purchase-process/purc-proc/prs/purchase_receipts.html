<p>You create a purchase receipt to account for items received from a vendor  as you assign them to your inventory.</p>

<p><strong>You can use a purchase receipt to:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>enter received  items against a purchase order</li>
  <li>increase inventory  when items are received</li>
  <li>update average  cost of items</li>
  <li>distribute freight  payable on items to the item value</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>In previous versions of Everest, purchase receipts received items into  inventory and handled your accounts payable to vendors. In Everest Version  4.0, these two functions are separate and addressed by the two separate  documents. You can now only make payments using a purchase invoice, and  although the system allows you to assign inventory on a purchase invoice  ideally you will only use a purchase receipt for that function.</dt>

<p><strong>In the new process you can:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>convert a purchase  order to a purchase receipt</li>
  <li>convert the same  purchase order to a purchase invoice</li>
  <li>convert a purchase  receipt to a purchase invoice only if the receipt was created directly  (without first creating a purchase order)</li>
  <li>convert a purchase  invoice to a purchase receipt only if the invoice was created directly  (without first creating a purchase order)</li>
</ul>
