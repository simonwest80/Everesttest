# Enter Quantities Received - Inventoried Items


You can enter the quantity of non-serialized items received on a purchase  receipt by selecting the **Transfer/Assign 
 new stock** option (path: **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile > **Options**  > **Attach/Retrieve Serial Number)**.


You can also directly enter the received quantity in the **Received**  column, if you select the **Use default 
 stock area to receive items when creating a new purchase receipt/invoice**  option in the **Location** profile  (path: F**ile &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Locations/Sub-Location &gt; Stock Transfer - Miscellaneous**  tab). Otherwise, when you try to enter a quantity in the **Received**  column, the **Assign Quantity** dialog  box is displayed where you can specify the stock area to which the items  are assigned and the item quantity received.


You can also enter negative quantities (i.e. return items on the purchase  receipt).

- Enter the quantity  prefixed with a negative sign in the **Received** column, if you select the **Use 
 default stock area to receive items when creating a new purchase receipt/invoice** option (path: **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Locations/Sub-Location &gt; Stock Transfer - Miscellaneous**  tab).
- Use the **Show/Attach 
 Area Wise Stock** option (path: **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile > **Options &gt; 
 Attach/Retrieve Serial Number**), if you do not select the **Use default stock area to receive items when 
 creating a new purchase receipt** option. **Everest**  displays the **Attach Quantity** dialog  box when you select this option.
