<h1 id="process-a-dropship--purchase-receipt">Process a Dropship  Purchase Receipt</h1>

<p>When a dropship purchase order is converted to a purchase receipt, and  you receive items on the receipt, the system prompts you to assign the  received items to the sales order and to create a sales invoice.</p>

<p><strong>You have the following options:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Assign received  items to the original sales order and create a sales invoice</li>
  <li>Assign received  items to the original sales order and don’t create a sales invoice</li>
  <li>Don’t assign received  items to the sales order (this will break the link with the sales order)</li>
</ul>

<p>If <strong>all</strong> of  the items are committed/shipped on the linked sales order and then you  try to receive the items on a purchase receipt, the system indicates that  you must break the link to the sales order in order to receive the items.  You may select <strong>Yes</strong> to break the  link and receive the items, or <strong>No</strong>  to leave the link intact and thus not receive items on this purchase receipt.  If you choose <strong>No</strong>, you must create  a new purchase receipt to accept the items independent of the dropship  order.</p>

<p>If <strong>some</strong>  of the items are committed/shipped on the linked sales order and then  you try to receive the items on a purchase receipt, the system asks if  you want to commit the backordered quantity on the sales order. You may  select <strong>Yes</strong> to commit the items  or <strong>No</strong> to leave the backorder unfilled.</p>
