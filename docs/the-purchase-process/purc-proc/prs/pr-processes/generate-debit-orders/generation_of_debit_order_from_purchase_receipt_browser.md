# Generation of Debit Order from Purchase Receipt Browser


The **Generation of Debit Order from****Purchase Receipt** browser is displayed  when you select **Options &gt; Utility 
 &gt; Generate DO** from the **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile.


This browser displays all the items on the purchase receipt that do  NOT have links to an existing debit order. All items in this browser are  selected by default.


{:.example}
When you create a debit order from purchase  receipt # 1000 that contains items A and B, both these items are checked  by default in the **Generation of Debit 
 Order from** **Purchase Receipt** browser.  You may choose to create the debit order for only one item, say A. Select  item A, and select **Options &gt; Create 
 DO** from the browser. After the debit order is created, item A is  no longer displayed in the **Generation 
 of Debit Order from** **Purchase Receipt** browser.
