<h1 id="modify-a-purchase-receipt">Modify a Purchase Receipt</h1>

<p>You can modify the <strong>Purchase Receipt</strong>  profile from the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Purchase 
 Receipts</strong> browser - Highlight the records and select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Purchase 
 Receipt</strong> profile - Specify the document number of the required receipt  in the <strong>Document #</strong> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accounting entries for purchase receipts are recorded in system Purchase  Journals. You can only modify a purchase receipt if it has not been posted.</p>

<p class="hint">To differentiate between purchase receipt  which are posted and unposted, add the field <strong>Is 
 Posted</strong> to the <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Receipts</strong> browser using the <strong>Field</strong> <strong>Chooser</strong>  option (<strong>Options &gt; Field Chooser</strong>).</p>

<p>You can edit Line Item details in a saved but unposted <strong>Purchase 
 Receipt</strong> profile.</p>

<p>When you edit the editable columns for a line item, and it results in  a change in the total value of the line item, certain back end processes  occur.</p>

<p>If the line item is already partially or fully invoiced on a purchase  invoice, the system automatically balances the Accrued Purchases account  so that the purchase receipt stays balanced with the purchase invoice.</p>
