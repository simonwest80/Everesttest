# Modify a Purchase Receipt


You can modify the **Purchase Receipt**  profile from the following locations:

- The **Purchase 
 Receipts** browser - Highlight the records and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.
- The **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile - Specify the document number of the required receipt  in the **Document #** field.



Accounting entries for purchase receipts are recorded in system Purchase  Journals. You can only modify a purchase receipt if it has not been posted.


{:.hint}
To differentiate between purchase receipt  which are posted and unposted, add the field **Is 
 Posted** to the **Purchase****Receipts** browser using the **Field** **Chooser**  option (**Options &gt; Field Chooser**).


You can edit Line Item details in a saved but unposted **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile.


When you edit the editable columns for a line item, and it results in  a change in the total value of the line item, certain back end processes  occur.


If the line item is already partially or fully invoiced on a purchase  invoice, the system automatically balances the Accrued Purchases account  so that the purchase receipt stays balanced with the purchase invoice.
