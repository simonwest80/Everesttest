<p>*Required Quantity (Calculated) = Planned Quantity – Current Supply</p>

<p>Current Supply = Total Stock – Open SO + Open PO</p>

<p>**Planned Quantity = The selected replenishment quantity (Max / Reorder  Point / Min)</p>

<p class="note"><strong>If **Purchase 
 in Increments of Vendor EOQ</strong> is selected, Planned Quantity is adjusted  with open sales orders and open purchase orders and is compared with increments  of the EOQ to get the required quantity. If you see a zero (0) in the  Required quantity column of the <strong>Item 
 Replenishment</strong> browser, the item is needed but you must make the  decision on if or how many should be purchased. This can occur when the  Vendor EOQ is higher than the calculated required quantity, increments  of Vendor EOQ are used, and the planned quantity cannot be exceeded.**</p>
