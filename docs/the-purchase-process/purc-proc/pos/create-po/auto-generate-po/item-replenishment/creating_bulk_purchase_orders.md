# Create Bulk Purchase Orders


Purchase orders can be created in bulk for selected items. The purchase  order is generated:

- For the quantity  required
- At the specified  cost
- For the default  vendor
- For one or all  locations



{:.steps}
To create bulk purchase orders, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Inventory** >  **Automated Purchases &gt; Item Replenishment** or press **Ctrl** + **M**.  You will see the **Automated 
 Purchases** dialog box.
- Choose an existing  filter or set the parameters to select the required items along with your  preferences for the inventory supply calculations.
- Click **Find**.
- From the **Item 
 Replenishment** browser, select the items to be replenished.  Review the quantities to be replenished in the **Required**  column and change them as necessary. Clear the check boxes for the items  that you do not want to replenish at this time.
- Select **Options** > **Generate 
 POs**.



The purchase order is created for the default vendor identified in the  **Item** profile (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Items &gt; Options &gt;Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Replenishment**  tab).
