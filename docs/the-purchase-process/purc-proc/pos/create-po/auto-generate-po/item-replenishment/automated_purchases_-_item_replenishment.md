# Automated Purchases Dialog box


Apart from setting the replenishment parameters to notify you about  the stock status of the item, you can also set the replenishment parameters  in the **Automated Purchases** dialog  box for an item to automatically generate purchase orders (path: **Inventory** > **Automated 
 Purchases** > **Item Replenishment**  or press **Ctrl** + **M**).


**Everest** will automatically generate  purchase orders as and when the stock goes below or beyond the specified  level. You have the opportunity to review and adjust the purchase orders  before they are generated.


In order to automatically generate purchase orders for replenishment,  complete the following steps:

- [Create  an Item Replenishment Filter]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/create_an_item_replenishment_filter_pur.html)
- [Run  the Item Replenishment Filter]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/run_the_item_replenishment_filter_pur.html)
- [Create  Bulk Purchase Orders]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/creating_bulk_purchase_orders.html)



**Filter Name**
: (Optional) To save your replenishment parameters  to use again, enter a name for your filter. Choose a name that closely  describes the items to be replenished. After you have set all of your  replenishment parameters in the **Automated 
 Purchases** dialog box, you can save your filter and store it in  **Everest**. Access this filter whenever  you need to automatically create purchase orders according to your selected  parameters. You can create multiple filters for your item replenishment  automated purchases depending upon your specific business needs.


The parameters that you can set for item replenishment automated purchases  are divided into two tabs:

- [Replenishment]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/find_item_replenishment_-_replenishment_tab.html)
- [Item  Selection]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/find_item_replenishment_-_item_selection.html)
