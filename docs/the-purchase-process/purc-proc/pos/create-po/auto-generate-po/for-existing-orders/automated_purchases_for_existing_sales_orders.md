# Automated Purchases for Existing Sales Orders


The **For Existing Orders** option  allows you to create purchase orders that are linked to specific sales  orders. You can create purchase orders for items with confirmed sales  orders, that are due for delivery in a specified period. Selecting this  option brings up the **Automated Purchases 
 - Existing Orders** browser.


The **Automated Purchases 
 - Existing Orders** Browser


This browser contains information such as item code, description, category,  sales measure, selling price, cost, last cost, average cost and weight.  It also lists the quantity needed, delivery date, ship to address, sales  order number, customer number, total stock, and stock available, on reserve,  on debit, on order and on credit. All items are grouped according to the  default vendor and are selected by default. This browser also displays  the customer's name, whether the customer is on hold, the payment terms  and currency code of the sales order, and the balance receivable on the  order.


All items for which a vendor is not defined are grouped together. Such  items cannot be selected, until you define a vendor for them.
