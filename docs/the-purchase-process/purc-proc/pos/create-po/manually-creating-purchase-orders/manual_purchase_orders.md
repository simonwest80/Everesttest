# Manual Purchase Orders


Manual purchase orders are created when you create an entry in a payment  journal with the entry type 'Miscellaneous Deposit'. The document number  you enter is prefixed with **M**  to denote it is a manual purchase order. If the document number is left  blank, the sequence number for manual purchase orders for the logged in  location or sub-location is used.


If sequence numbers are not assigned to the logged in location or sub-location,  then the sequence number assigned to the default location (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting** > **Miscellaneous** tab  > **Default Location** field) is  used.


You can make modifications to manual purchase orders and convert them  to purchase receipts or purchase invoices in the same manner as system  documents.

**View Manual Purchase Orders**
: You can view manual purchase orders from the **Purchase Orders** browser by selecting  the **Include Manual Documents** option  (path: **Purchase Orders** browser  > **Options** > **Include****manual documents**).


**Modify Manual Purchase Orders**
: You can modify manual purchase orders from the **Purchase Order** profile just as you would  with system documents. This is the preferred method for making manual  purchase order modifications since only limited modifications are possible  from the payment journal.
