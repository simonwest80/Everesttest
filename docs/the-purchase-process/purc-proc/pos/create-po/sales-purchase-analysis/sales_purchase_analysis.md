# Sales/Purchase Analysis


The effectiveness of your purchase function would be reflected in the  prices at which you are able to procure goods and services over a period  of time. Purchase analysis is also required to make purchasing decisions  over a long term. Sales analysis is required to analyze the trends in  sales prices and sales quantities of items.


The **Sales/Purchase Analysis** option  gives an analysis of purchases made in conjunction with sales over selected  time periods. The analysis can be obtained for quantity, price and value.  You can also obtain a summary or detailed analysis. This option is a powerful  analysis tool for:

- Viewing short term  or long term trends in purchase and sales prices of selected or all items.
- Obtaining a percent  contribution of each item to total purchases in a category in a period.
- Viewing the trend  in sales quantities over a period to plan for future purchases to meet  the sales.
- Obtaining a percent  contribution of each category to total purchases in a period.
- Checking what proportion  of your total expenses is accounted for by different item types - such  as inventoried and non-inventoried.
- Checking the trend  in expenses of a certain type to see which category of item is showing  the fastest rate of increase over a period.



By configuring and selecting the relevant options, you can obtain purchase  and sales analysis on virtually any or all of the relevant parameters  and present it in the required graphical format.
