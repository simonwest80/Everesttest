# Purchase Orders


The purchase order is the second document generated in the purchase  process. The purchase order:

- Is created when  you decide to purchase products or services from a vendor.
- Records details  of the order placed. It is an affirmation of the vendor's proposal by  the purchaser. It records the description, quantity, and related information  for items and services that the company intends to purchase.



You can either create a purchase order directly or convert an existing  purchase quote to a purchase order. However, the purchase order is not  mandatory; you can create a purchase receipt or a purchase invoice (with  some restrictions) directly.


{:.note}
The purchase order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when you create a purchase  order unless you make a deposit against it.
