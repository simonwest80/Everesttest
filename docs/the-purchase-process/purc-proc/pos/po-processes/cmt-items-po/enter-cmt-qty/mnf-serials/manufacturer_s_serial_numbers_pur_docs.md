# Manufacturer's Serial Numbers


Most manufacturers assign serial numbers to their products. These numbers  are prefixed with the part/item number and suffixed with the model number


You may assign the manufacturer's serial numbers to committed quantities  in any of the following ways:

- Entering the manufacturer's  serial number in the **Mfg. Ser. 
 #** column of the **Serial Number 
 for all Items** browser (path: purchase document profile > **Options** > **Show****All** **Serial**  #) **OR** the **Serial 
 #** browser (path: purchase document profile > **Options**  > **Items** > **Show****Serial** **#**).
- Automatically generate  the numbers to be assigned.



{:.note}
You can assign manufacture’s serial numbers  to items only after you save the **Purchase****Order** profile.

When you scan/enter a manufacturer’s serial number, **Everest**  searches the database to check if it is attached to any other serial number.  If so, **Everest** displays a **Serial** **Number**  browser, which lists all the serial numbers (that are not assigned) that  pertain to the manufacturer’s serial numbers.
