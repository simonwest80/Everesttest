# Process a Purchase Order to a Purchase Receipt


A Purchase Receipt is used to track items received from a vendor. You  may assign received items to inventory within the Purchase Receipt.


You can process a purchase order to a purchase receipt by using the  **Receive** option (path: **Purchase****Order** profile > **Options** > **Process** > **Receive**). The details of the order  are copied to a **Purchase** **Receipt** profile.


When you save the purchase receipt, the quantity received is updated  to the Received column of the purchase order. If you receive committed  quantities, the quantity is reduced in the Committed column of the purchase  order.
