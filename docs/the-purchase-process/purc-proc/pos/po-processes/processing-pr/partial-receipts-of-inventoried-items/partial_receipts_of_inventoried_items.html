<p>A purchase order can be received in parts. In this case you can create  a purchase receipt for each shipment received.</p>

<p>When a partial receipt is made the purchase order is assigned the Received  status ‘Partially Received’. You can view this status on the document  profile and in Status column of the Purchase Orders browser. This status  is assigned until the remaining items are received when it is assigned  the status ‘Fully Received’.</p>

<p class="example">If five computers are ordered, but only three  are received, a receipt can be created for the three items that are received.  The purchase order is assigned the status of ‘Partially Received’ until  the remaining items are received.</p>
