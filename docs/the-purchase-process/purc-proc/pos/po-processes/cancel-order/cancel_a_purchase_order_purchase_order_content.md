# Cancel a Purchase Order


If you do not wish to continue the purchase process with your vendor,  then you can cancel the purchase order (path: **Purchase****Order** profile > **Options**  > **Process** > **Cancel**).


On doing so, the system converts it to a purchase quote which is available  as a normal system document.


The following purchase orders cannot be canceled:

- A purchase order  that is a ‘Back Order’.
- A purchase order  on which a deposit has been made.
