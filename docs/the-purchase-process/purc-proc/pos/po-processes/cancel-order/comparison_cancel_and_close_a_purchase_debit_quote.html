<p>This section provides a comparison between cancelling and closing a  purchase/debit order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Orders that cannot  be cancelled can be marked as closed. An order cannot be cancelled when  it has a payment history or when it is a back order.</li>
  <li>When an order is  cancelled, the entire order is annulled and it reverts to a purchase/debit  quote. Closing an order merely marks the order as closed, and these orders  can be viewed in the <strong>Shipped Purchase/Debit 
 Orders</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
