# Back End Processes - Mark a Purchase Order Complete

- When you mark an  order as complete, its status changes to 'Closed'. Closed orders are displayed  in the **Received Orders** browser  (path: **Purchase** **Order**  profile > **Options** > **Received** **Purchase****Orders** toggle option).
- The ordered quantity  is reduced to either the received or invoiced quantity, whichever is less.
- The committed quantity,  if any, is detached from the order.
- The "On Order"  and "On Order Committed" quantities in the **Item 
 Stock Status** dialog box correspondingly reduce.
