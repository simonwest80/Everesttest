# Back End Processes - Mark a Purchase Order Open


When you reopen an order, its statuses change from Closed to the following:


Received status:

- Not received -  if the received quantity on the closed order was zero
- Partially received  - if some items on the order were received
- Fully received  - if all of the items on the order were received



Invoiced status:

- Not invoiced -  if the invoiced quantity on the closed order was zero
- Partially invoiced  - if some items on the order were invoiced
- Fully invoiced  - if all of the items on the order were invoiced



Open orders (not fully received and invoiced) are displayed in the **Purchase** **Orders**  browser (path: **Purchasing** >  **Purchase** **Orders**  > **Purchase** **Orders**  browser).
