# Payment Info


Click the **Payment Info** button  to view the following information:


**Batch Processing**
: Select this check box if you want to process payments  in a batch, instead of processing the payments for each document individually.  If you select this option, the transactions will be added to, and can  subsequently be processed from the **Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others** browser.
: This check box is displayed/hidden depending on  the preference you set for processing payments (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous**  tab > **Document payments** tab  > **Batch Payments** section).  You must possess adequate security rights to select this box.
