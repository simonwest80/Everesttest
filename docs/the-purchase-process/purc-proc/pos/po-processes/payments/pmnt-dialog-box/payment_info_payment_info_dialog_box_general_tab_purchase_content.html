<dl>
  <dt><strong>Batch Processing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box if you want to process payments  in a batch, instead of processing the payments for each document individually.  If you select this option, the transactions will be added to, and can  subsequently be processed from the <strong>Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others</strong> browser.</dd>
  <dd>This check box is displayed/hidden depending on  the preference you set for processing payments (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous</strong>  tab &gt; <strong>Document payments</strong> tab  &gt; <strong>Batch Payments</strong> section).  You must possess adequate security rights to select this box.</dd>
