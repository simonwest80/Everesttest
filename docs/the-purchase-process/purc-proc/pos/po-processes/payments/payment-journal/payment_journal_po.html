<p>Document payments or refunds are entered in a payment journal. Payments  and refunds are entered in an ‘open’ journal that fulfills the following  conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A journal whose  accounting period corresponds to the login date.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> of the user entering the payment/refund.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location of the  user entering the payment/refund.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the description ‘Payment Journal’.</li>
  <li>A journal with  the same bank account as the one specified for the payment method.</li>
</ul>

<p>If such an open journal does not exist, a new payment journal is created.  The new journal bears the sequence numbers assigned for payment journals  for the logged in location or sub-location.</p>

<p>If such a sequence number is not assigned, the sequence number assigned  to the <strong>Default Location</strong> (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab) is used.</p>
