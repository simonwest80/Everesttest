<p>When more than one currency is involved in a payment, <strong>Everest</strong>  uses cross-currency calculations.</p>

<p class="example">Assume that your base currency is United States Dollar (USD) and you  have created a purchase invoice for a vendor whose currency is Great Britain  Pound (GBP). You pay the vendor in Euros (EUR) out of a bank account maintained  in Japanese Yen (JPY). <strong>Everest</strong>  uses cross currency calculations so that your bank account balance will  reduce by the JPY amount that equals the value of the EUR check issued.</p>

<p>In this case, <strong>Everest</strong> first  uses the exchange rate available for EUR to USD to calculate the equivalent  USD amount for the payment amount. Everest then translates this USD amount  to the JPY amount using the exchange rate available from USD to JPY.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>cross-currency calculations</strong>.  The result thus derived is the same as directly translating EUR to JPY  since the exchange rate from EUR to JPY can be obtained by equating the  USD/EUR rate to the JPY/USD rate.</p>

<p>Thus the accounts have to be updated not only in terms of the base currency  but also in their respective currencies.</p>

<p>The presumption while performing cross currency calculations is that  the exchange rates entered for the payment currency, the bank currency  and the document currency against the base are all from the same foreign  exchange market.</p>

<p class="example">Base Currency = USD</p>

<p>Amount of payment = 1000 EUR</p>

<p>Exchange rate for EUR to USD: 1 EUR = 1.10 USD</p>

<p>Bank currency = JPY</p>

<p>Exchange rate for USD to JPY: 1 USD = 123.247 JPY</p>

<p>1000 EUR in terms of JPY = 135571.7 JPY</p>

<p>Document currency = GBP</p>

<p>Exchange rate for GBP to USD: 1 GBP = 1.41218 USD</p>

<p>1000 EUR in terms of GBP = 1270.962</p>
