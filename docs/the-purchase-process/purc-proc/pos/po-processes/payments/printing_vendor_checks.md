# Print Vendor Checks


When you make a payment on a purchase order/invoice or debit order/  memo, **Everest** prompts you to confirm  whether you want to print the check.


{:.note}
This prompt is displayed only if the payment method used is of type  "Check" and the check number is NOT entered in the **Payment**  dialog box.


Select **Yes** to display the [**Check 
 Printing** dialog box]({{site.acc_chm}}/misc/check_printing_dialog.html).


You can also print vendor checks by using the [**Print Checks** option]({{site.acc_chm}}/vendor-payments-and-refunds/payment-jrnl-proc/printing-checks/printing_checks_payment_journal_profile.html) in the **** Payment Journal.
