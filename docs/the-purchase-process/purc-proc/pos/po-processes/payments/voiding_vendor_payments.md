# Voiding Vendor Payments


Vendor payments are accounted in a payment journal. A payment journal  that is not posted can be voided. When the journal is voided, all processes  that took place on payment such as reducing the vendor's balance, updating  payment amount on document and document status are rolled back. A vendor  payment can be voided from the payment history.
