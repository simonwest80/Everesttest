<p>Vendors often require deposits to be made along with purchase orders.  You can make payments against an order by using the <strong>Payment 
 &gt; Pay</strong> option from the <strong>Purchase 
 Order</strong> profile.</p>

<p class="note">You cannot make payments against closed purchase orders.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/steps.gif" alt="" />To make payments against a document, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the purchase  document profile, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Payment</strong> &gt; <strong>Pay</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/pos/po-processes/payments/pmnt-dialog-box/the_payment_dialog.html"><strong>Payment</strong> dialog box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Pay</strong>  option is enabled only against an existing purchase order or purchase  invoice. To create an order/invoice and make payments against it, save  the order/invoice and then select the option.</p>

<p>When you click the <strong>Pay</strong> option,  <strong>Everest</strong> checks if there are pending  transactions in the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser for that document. If pending transactions are found, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you whether you want to process existing batch payments or receive  a new payment. The prompt also displays the total value of all pending  batch payments for the document.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Process existing batch payments</strong>  to view the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser from where you can process the payment. To receive a new payment,  you should have appropriate security rights.</p>
