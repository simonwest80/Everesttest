<p>When a refund is made against a purchase order, the following back end  processes occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The vendor’s  unposted amount (in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile) increases by the amount of refund. The amount payable to the  vendor increases. When the payment journal for the payment is posted,  the unposted amount reduces and the posted amount increases with the amount  refunded. The amount payable to the vendor stays the same.</li>
</ul>
