# The Purchase Document Browser


The **Purchase** **Document**  browser lists all documents for a selected purchase document type (path:  **Purchasing** > **Purchase 
 Quotes/Purchase Orders/Purchase Receipts/Purchase Invoices**). The  browser lists all documents for that type regardless of their document  aliases.


![]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/img/steps.gif)To view documents with a specific alias, do  the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Purchasing** > **Other** **Documents**.  You will see a submenu that lists the purchase documents.
- From the submenu,  select the required document type. You will see another submenu that lists  the aliases for the document.
- Select the  alias to view its document browser.



{:.note}
The **Other****Documents** option displays purchase  quotes, purchase orders, purchase receipts, and purchase invoices along  with other document aliases. These are the system aliases for purchase  documents. Selecting any of these options brings up a browser of purchase  quotes, orders, receipts, or invoices that do not have a user-defined  document alias.


{:.example}
If you do not select an alias for purchase  quote, the document comes up in the **Purchase 
 Quotes** browser from the **Other 
 Documents** option.
