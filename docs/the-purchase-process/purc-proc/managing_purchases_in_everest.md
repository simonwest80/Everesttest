# Manage Purchases in Everest


You can manage **** purchases and  vendor payments in two different ways:

1. By creating purchase  and purchase return documents, and making payments against them.
- By generating manual  accounting entries for purchases or purchase returns in a purchase journal.



The sequence of steps involved in creating purchase documents is called  the purchase process. The following documents are used in the purchase  process:

- Purchase Quotes
- Purchase Orders
- Purchase Receipts
- Purchase Invoices



The sequence of steps involved in returning purchased goods are collectively  called the purchase returns process. The following documents are used  in the purchase return process:

- Debit Quotes
- Debit Orders
- Debit Memos



When tasks related to purchasing or vendor payments are carried out  through purchase documents, **Everest**  automatically generates the accounting entries in a purchase or payment  journal. These journals are called "system journals".


The journals in which manual entries are made are termed "manual  journals". Manual entries cannot be made in a system journal. When  a manual journal is created, only the amount payable or due from the vendor  is recorded; details of items purchased or returned are not provided.  Thus, manual purchase journals do not affect inventory.
