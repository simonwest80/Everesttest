# Reserve


When you place an order against an existing quote, you can convert the  quote to a purchase order by using the **Reserve**  option (path: **Purchase** **Quote**  profile > **Options** > **Process** > **Reserve**).


Once the order has been created, the purchase quote:

- Ceases to exist  as a system document.
- Generates a purchase  order with Open status.

- Can no longer be  accessed through the **Purchase Quotes**  browser.
- The quote number  is displayed as a reference number in the purchase order created.
- The document number  for the new purchase order is automatically generated by the system.
