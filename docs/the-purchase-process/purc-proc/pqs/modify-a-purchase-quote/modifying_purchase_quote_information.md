You can modify all information in a purchase quote if it has not been  converted to a purchase order.


The **Purchase** **Quote**  profile can be modified from any of the following locations:

- The **Purchase****Quotes** browser - Highlight the  record and select **Options** >  **Edit** > **In****New** **Window**.
- The **Purchase****Quote** profile - Specify the document  number of the required quote in the **Document****#** field.
