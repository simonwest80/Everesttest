# De-link Recurring Documents


Before the recurring purchase orders are converted to a purchase receipt,  you can choose to break the documentâ€™s link to the recurrence pattern.  The delinked document is no longer displayed when **Options**  > **Recurring** **documents**  is selected from the **Purchase****Orders** browser.


{:.note}
A purchase order that belongs to a recurrence  series will also be de-linked if an inventoried item is added to it.
