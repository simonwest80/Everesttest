<p>Processing involves conversion of the purchase orders to purchase invoices.</p>

<p>Document Dates</p>

<ul>
  <li>The document  date of the purchase order must be earlier or equal to login date at the  time of converting the order.</li>
  <li>If the invoice  date must be the same as the order date, the document date of the order  must belong to an active period or an open one (if there is no active  period). If the invoice date is the login date at the time of converting,  the login date must belong to the active period, or to an open period,  if there is no active period.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>You can process  multiple recurring purchase orders at the same time, provided these orders  bear the login date or a date prior to the login date.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">To view all orders that need to be converted  to a invoice on a particular day, group the documents by document date.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/steps.gif" alt="" />To process recurring documents, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Purchasing</strong> &gt;  <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Orders</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Orders</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Orders</strong>  browser, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Recurring</strong> <strong>documents</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Only recurring purchase orders that are not converted  to a purchase invoice are displayed in the browser.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the  document(s) to be processed.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Orders</strong>  browser, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Process</strong> <strong>recurring</strong><strong>documents</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> converts the selected  purchase orders to invoice and saves the purchase invoice automatically.</p>
