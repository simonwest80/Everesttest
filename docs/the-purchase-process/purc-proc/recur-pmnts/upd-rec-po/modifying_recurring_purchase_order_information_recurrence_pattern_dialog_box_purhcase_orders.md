# Modify Recurring Purchase Order Information


All information that can be modified in normal purchase orders can also  be modified on recurring purchase orders.

When you modify a recurring purchase order, you can also modify all  future documents in the series.


{:.example}
If you change the item cost on the fifth purchase  order in a series of 12 recurring orders, you can choose to update the  cost change in the 7 remaining orders in the series also.


When you modify the document, **Everest**  prompts if you want to similarly modify all subsequent documents in the  series. Click **Yes** or **No**  as required.
