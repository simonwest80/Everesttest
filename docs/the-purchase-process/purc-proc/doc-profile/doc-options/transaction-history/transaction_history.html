<ul>
  <li>Details of purchase  quote/order/receipt/invoice creation such as date and time of creation,  amount of document and the user who created the document.</li>
  <li>Details of payments  or deposits made and refunded on the document such as the payment type  and reference number; details of payments applied to the document.  Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last four="" digits="" of="" the="" card=""> when the **Enable
