<p>The following are the advantages of distributing add-on costs on purchase  receipts and invoices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The cost of  the item will reflect the true cost which comprises the cost of purchase  and the add-on costs payable. This helps in a more accurate analysis of  profits and margins.</li>
  <li>The last cost  and average cost of the item displays the true cost inclusive of add-on  costs. This helps in cost comparisons.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">A vendor charges $10 on an item exclusive  of freight of $1.50. Another vendor charges $11 inclusive of freight.  On a comparison without freight, the first vendor’s price seems better,  but if freight is distributed, the second vendor’s price is more attractive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accounting  standards and guidelines of several countries require that add-on costs  on inventory be added to the value of the inventory, and should not be  expensed.</li>
</ul>
