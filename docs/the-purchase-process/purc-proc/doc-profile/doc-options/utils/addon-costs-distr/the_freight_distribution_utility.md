# The Add-on Costs Distribution Utility


The **Add-on Costs** **Distribution**  utility allows you to distribute freight and other costs across the items  purchased.


{:.note}
- Freight and additional  costs can be distributed for an item only if the option **Allow 
 Freight Distribution** is selected (path: **Inventory**  > **Items** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Purchases**  tab).
- The add-on costs  distribution utility is not available for purchase quotes and return documents.  However, this option does function when you enter negative quantities  on a debit order or memo.
