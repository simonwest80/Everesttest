<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to compute  freight using the <strong>Everest Freight Estimator</strong>.</p>

<p>Freight is computed on an item only if the <strong>Include 
 in Freight Calculation</strong> option is selected on the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Purchase</strong> tab).</p>

<p class="note">Freight may be included in a final document  (purchase invoice/credit memo) even after it has been created and saved.  However a final document whose journal has been posted cannot be modified.</p>

<p><strong>The **Everest 
 Freight Estimator</strong> option allows you to compute freight based on  destination zones for all countries. This basically allows you to evaluate  the freight charged by vendors.**</p>

<p><strong>To enable the **Everest 
 Freight Estimator</strong> option to compute freight, the name of the carrier  and the equivalent delivery service has to be identified in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/everest-freight-estimator/delivery-methods/set-up-a-delivery-method/creating_a_new_delivery_method.html"><strong>Delivery Method</strong> profile</a>.**</p>

<p><strong>Freight is calculated based  on the:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Originating  zip code (of the document’s location or the location of the document’s  location/sub-location).</li>
  <li>Destination  zip code (of the ship to address in the document).</li>
  <li>Ship-via agent  (the delivery method selected).</li>
  <li>Rate Definition.</li>
</ul>

<p>The freight charges include transportation cost, COD fee, residential  charges and insurance cost wherever applicable.</p>
