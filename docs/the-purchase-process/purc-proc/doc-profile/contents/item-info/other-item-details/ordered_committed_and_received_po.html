<dl>
  <dt><strong>Quantity</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the quantity of the item that  has been ordered. This column is available in purchase orders that are  created directly and have not yet been saved.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Ordered</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the quantity of the item ordered  from the vendor. If the order was processed from a quote, the quantity  entered in the <strong>Quantity</strong> column  of the quote is displayed in the <strong>Ordered</strong>  column of the purchase order.</dd>
  <dd>Entering the item quantity is useful even in the  case of non-inventoried items.</dd>
  <dt>You may not want to maintain an inventory  of paper clip boxes, but the vendor would still want to know how many  boxes you are ordering.</dt>
  <dd>This column is in the decimal accuracy of the unit  of measure. You can increase the decimal accuracy up to six places.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Committed</strong></dt>
  <dd>This column displays the quantity of the inventoried  item that has been committed by the vendor for shipment. The committed  quantity can represent either:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Items  that you physically receive but do not take into stock until approval,  or</li>
  <li>Items  in transit.</li>
</ul>

<dl class="note">
  <dt>When a committed quantity of a non-serialized item is  received or serial numbers of a serialized item attached to a purchase  order are received, the quantity in the committed column reduces. The  committed column displays quantities committed but not received.</dt>
  <dd>Committed quantities received on a purchase order  are received in an <strong>Out</strong> type of  stock area.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/lens.gif" alt="" /> <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/miscellaneous-set-up/stock-areas/stock_area_types.html">Stock  Area Types</a></dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">You cannot enter quantities for non-inventoried items in this column.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>In case of an auto-serialized item, this column displays the quantity  committed with a suffix ‘a’ indicating the item is auto-serialized.</dt>
  <dd>This column is in the decimal accuracy of the unit  of measure. You can increase the decimal accuracy up to six places.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Received</strong></dt>
  <dd>In the case of an open purchase order, this column  has no value.</dd>
  <dd>When you convert a purchase order to a purchase  receipt, this column automatically updates with the quantity entered into  the Received column of the purchase receipt.

  <dd>You cannot edit this column.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Invoiced</strong></dt>

  <dd>You cannot edit this column.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Positive and Negative Quantities</strong></p>

<p>You can have both positive and negative quantities of items on a document.  Positive quantities on a purchase order indicate that the item has been  ordered, while negative quantities indicate that it is to be returned.</p>

<p>A serial number generated and committed to a positive quantity  on a purchase order will be in an ”out” type of stock  area, while a serial number attached to a negative quantity will  be in a ”stock” type of area<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>The following fields are updated to the stock measure after conversion  from the sales measure for the item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Total Stock</li>
  <li>On Reserve</li>
  <li>On Reserve Commit</li>
  <li>On Credit</li>
  <li>On Credit Commit  Quantity</li>
</ul>

<p>You cannot change measures in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Committed Quantities</li>
  <li>Backorders</li>
  <li>Shipped Orders</li>
</ul>

<p>If you change the decimal accuracy of a measure, the original quantity  is shown in the decimal accuracy of the changed measure.</p>

<p class="example">If your quantity is entered as 10.20 and the  decimal accuracy of the measure is changed to 0, the quantity is shown  as 10.</p>
