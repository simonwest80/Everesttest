# Bin


The bin selected in the **Put Away Bin**  column (path: **Inventory** > **Item** > **Replenishment**  tab) will appear here. This column will not appear once you save a **Purchase Receipt** profile.


{:.note}
- If the bin is not  defined at the **Item** level (path:  **Inventory** > **Item 
 &gt; Replenishment** tab), it will be blanked out in the **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile.
- The **Assign 
 Quantity** dialog box in the **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile will Â appear  only if you have not defined the stock bin both at **Item**  level and logged in location. Also, the **Assign 
 Quantity** dialog box will appear, if the line item is a lot tracked  item.
