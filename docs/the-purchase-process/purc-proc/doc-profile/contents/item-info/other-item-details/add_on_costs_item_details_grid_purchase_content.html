<p>The <strong>Add-on Costs</strong> column displays  the per-unit value of the add-on amounts for all the add-on costs elements  (the add-on amount divided by the quantity). The system uses the following  quantities in the calculation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ordered quantity  on a purchase order</li>
  <li>Received quantity  on a purchase receipt</li>
  <li>Received on Invoice  quantity on a purchase invoice using the Received view (in the options  menu)</li>
  <li>Invoiced quantity  on a purchase invoice using the Invoice view (in the options menu)</li>
</ul>

<p>This column is not displayed in purchase and debit quotes.</p>

<p>Use of Add-on Costs</p>

<p>In order to arrive at the correct cost of an item, you must include  the following costs in the item’s cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Packaging charges</li>
  <li>Loading/Unloading  charges</li>
  <li>Import/Export duties</li>
  <li>Courier charges</li>
  <li>Freight charges</li>
  <li>All other costs  that you are liable to pay the vendor for bringing the items to your offices/warehouses</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional expenses incurred on items should be distributed across each  item purchased to arrive at the accurate purchase cost. Distribution of  additional costs is required for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proper pricing  of the product to arrive at the sale cost.</li>
  <li>Accurate valuation  of closing inventory.</li>
</ul>
