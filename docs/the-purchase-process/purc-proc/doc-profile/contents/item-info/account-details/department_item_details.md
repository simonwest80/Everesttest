Non-inventoried Items


You can change the location or sub-location for a non-inventoried item,  if the expense has to be allocated to any other cost center or location/sub-location.

Change the Document’s Location/Sub-Location


If you change the document's location/sub-location (path: purchase document  profile > **Details** tab >  **Loc/Sub-Loc** field), you can either  update the location/sub-location for all line items with the selected  location/sub-location, or choose to retain the original location/sub-location  for the line items.

{:.note}
If you click **No**, the location/sub-location  displayed in the **Loc/Sub-Loc** column  of the Item Details Grid does not change. You should have adequate security  rights to retain the line item location/sub-location (that is different  from the document’s location/sub-location).


The revenues and expenses associated with the line item are allocated  to this location/sub-location.
