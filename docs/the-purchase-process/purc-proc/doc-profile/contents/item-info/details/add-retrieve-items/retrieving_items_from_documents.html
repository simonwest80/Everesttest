<p>You can also modify the retrieved information. Retrieving items from  sales documents is useful when you make a single purchase of items present  in more than one purchase or sales document.</p>

<p class="example">If you have received two sales orders and  want to obtain a single quote for all items on these two sales orders,  you can retrieve a copy of each sales order into a purchase quote.</p>

 Address</strong>. Select your option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>Information pertaining to the vendor of the  original document is not retrieved into the new document.</p>

<p>In case of serialized items, the quantity  fields in the Item Details Grid are not populated with values from the  original item.</p>

<p>If the document that you retrieve contains discontinued items, <strong>Everest</strong> informs you of it. You can choose  to:</p>

<ul>

 active items</strong> - Select this option to add only active items in the  document to the purchase document.</li>
