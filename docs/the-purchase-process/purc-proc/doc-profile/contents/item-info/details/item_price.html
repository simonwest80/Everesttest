<h1 id="item-cost">Item Cost</h1>

<p>The <strong>Item</strong> <strong>Cost</strong>  column displays the cost at which the item is bought from the vendor.  By default, for a new company <strong>Vendor 
 Standard cost</strong> appears. If you have migrated from <strong>Everest</strong>  3.0 to <strong>Everest</strong> 3.0.1, <strong>Item 
 Last cost</strong> appears in this column. Change the item cost, if necessary.  You can also change the cost i.e. <strong>Vendor 
 Standard cost</strong>, <strong>Vendor Last cost</strong>,  <strong>Item Last cost</strong>, or <strong>Item 
 Average cost</strong> that should be used in this column. You can change  it in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/flow-ctrl/ctrl/opt/prompts-tab/prompts_purchase_document_tab_step_by_step_business_process_in_everest.html">Documents  preferences</a> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt;  <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>).  Enter the item cost in the cost decimal accuracy of the item.</p>

<p class="note">If you want to change the default unit of  measure, the cost decimal accuracy, or the quantity decimal accuracy,  you need additional security rights.</p>

<p class="note">The cost of the item is the cost at which  an inventoried item is valued and a non-inventoried item is expensed.</p>

<p class="example">If the vendor quotes a cost of $10 and a non-recoverable  tax of $1 is payable on the item, the cost entered is $11. If the tax  on the item is recoverable against sales tax collected from customers,  the cost of the item is $10.</p>

<p>Processed Documents</p>

<p>If a quote is converted to an order, or an order to a receipt or invoice,  the quoted or ordered cost is displayed. The cost can be changed on a  quote or an order at any time, but not on a saved purchase receipt or  invoice.</p>

<p>Foreign Currency Documents</p>

<p>All costs are displayed in the currency defined for the selected vendor  in the <strong>Currency Code</strong> field (path:  <strong>Purchasing</strong> &gt; <strong>Vendors</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Multicurrency</strong> tab).</p>

<p>If the vendor’s currency is different from the base currency, use the  <strong>View in Document Currency</strong> option  (path: <strong>Purchase Document</strong> profile  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>View 
 in Document Currency</strong>) to view in the cost in the base currency.</p>
