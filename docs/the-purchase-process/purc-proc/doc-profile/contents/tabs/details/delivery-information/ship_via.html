<p>Whenever you create a new purchase document, the default delivery method  specified in the <strong>Delivery Method</strong>  field (path: <strong>Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab)  is displayed in this field. You can select another delivery method if  required.</p>

<p class="note">In case of drop shipments, the <strong>Ship 
 Via</strong> field shows the same shipment method as the related sales document.  However, you are allowed to change this.</p>

<p>The delivery method is also used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Estimate the  freight due on the shipment if the price quoted by the vendor is exclusive  of freight.</li>
  <li>To track shipments.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If the carrier specified for the delivery  method is Federal Express, you can track the shipment using the tracking  number.</p>
