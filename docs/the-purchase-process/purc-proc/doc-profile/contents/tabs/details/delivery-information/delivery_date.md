# Delivery Date


When you create a purchase document, by default the **Delivery 
 Date** field displays the login date. If required, you can modify  the **Delivery Date**.


**Delivery** **Date 
 on a Purchase Quote or Order**


The **Delivery Date** field (in  a purchase quote or order) allows you to specify the expected delivery  date of the shipment. The delivery date on purchase orders helps you plan  inventories.


Delivery Date on a Purchase Receipt


The delivery date on a purchase receipt identifies when the items were  actually received, as there could be a time lag between the receipt of  items and the creation of the purchase receipt.


**Processed Documents**


When you convert a purchase/debit quote to an order or an order to a  purchase invoice/debit memo, the following will occur:

- The converted document  displays the login date, if the delivery date on the quote/order is blank.
- The converted document  displays the date on the quote/order, if a delivery date has been specified  in the quote/order.
