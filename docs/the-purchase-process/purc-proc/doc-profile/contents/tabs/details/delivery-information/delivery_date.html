<p>When you create a purchase document, by default the <strong>Delivery 
 Date</strong> field displays the login date. If required, you can modify  the <strong>Delivery Date</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery</strong> <strong>Date 
 on a Purchase Quote or Order</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Delivery Date</strong> field (in  a purchase quote or order) allows you to specify the expected delivery  date of the shipment. The delivery date on purchase orders helps you plan  inventories.</p>

<p>Delivery Date on a Purchase Receipt</p>

<p>The delivery date on a purchase receipt identifies when the items were  actually received, as there could be a time lag between the receipt of  items and the creation of the purchase receipt.</p>

<p><strong>Processed Documents</strong></p>

<p>When you convert a purchase/debit quote to an order or an order to a  purchase invoice/debit memo, the following will occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The converted document  displays the login date, if the delivery date on the quote/order is blank.</li>
  <li>The converted document  displays the date on the quote/order, if a delivery date has been specified  in the quote/order.</li>
</ul>
