<h1 id="exchange-rate">Exchange Rate</h1>

<p>The <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field allows  you to specify the exchange rate between your base currency and the vendor  currency. This field is enabled only in case of foreign currency vendors.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/lens.gif" alt="" /> <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/doc-profile/contents/tabs/details/for-cur-info/foreign_currency_document.html">Foreign Currency  Documents</a></p>

<p>By default, this field displays the latest exchange rate defined in  the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Multi-currency &gt; Exchange Rates &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New 
 Window &gt; Exchange Rates</strong> profile). <strong>Everest</strong>  determines whether the Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on  the setting in the <strong>Rate for Purchase 
 Documents</strong> field (path: <strong>File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency 
 &gt; Exchange Rates</strong>). Exchange rates have up to six decimals.</p>

<p>If the exchange rate for the document is different from the current  rate, you can change the rate.</p>

<p class="example">If your purchases from a foreign vendor are  covered by a fixed rate contract (where you contract to buy the foreign  exchange at a specified rate) the exchange rate for the document will  be the same as that defined in the contract.</p>

<p>Exchange Rate for Purchase Document Conversion</p>

<p>If there is a time lag between the creation of an intermediate document  and the final document, the exchange rate could fluctuate. <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to take care of such situations by setting a preference in  the <strong>Exchange rate used when converting 
 quotes, orders, and receipts</strong> field in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/misc/miscellaneous_others_others_2_steps.html">Documents  dialog box</a> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; 
 Others &gt; Others 2</strong> tab). The selected option takes effect when  you convert a purchase quote to an order, an order to a receipt, and a  receipt or order to an invoice.</p>

<p>The options available in this field are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prompt 
 user with the exchange rate available as on date logged in</strong> - If  you select this option, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts  you with the latest exchange rate available on the login date (for the  document currency). Click <strong>Yes</strong>  to replace the existing exchange rate with the latest exchange rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 the exchange rate on the document being converted</strong> - If you select  this option, the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field  defaults to the exchange rate available on the document being processed.</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 the exchange rate available as on date logged in</strong> - If you select  this field, the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong>  field defaults to the latest exchange rate available on the login date.</li>
</ul>
