# Document Date


The date displayed in a purchase document is the date of creation of  the document. The document date:

- Is by default  the login date. You cannot change the date once the document is saved.  To create documents with a different date, you must log in with a different  date. You can, however, edit the **Document 
 Date** field before saving when creating a new Purchase Invoice.
- Is used to  compute the due date for the document if the payment terms are of the  **On Account**.



Processed Documents


If a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to a receipt  or invoice, it displays the login date of the conversion.

Document Date - Purchase Invoice/Debit Memo


The document date on a purchase invoice/debit memo determines the accounting  period in which the accounting entries for purchases/returns must be created.


Document Date â€“ Purchase Invoice


With the **Purchase Invoice Date: Modify**  security right, you can edit the new Purchase Invoice date before saving.  The Document Date cannot be less than any Purchase Orders or Purchase  Receipts linked to the Purchase Invoice and it must fall into a valid  (Open) accounting period.
