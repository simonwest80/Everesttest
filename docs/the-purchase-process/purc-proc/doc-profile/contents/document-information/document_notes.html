<p>Notes can be attached to purchase documents to keep track of important  messages or information pertaining to the document (path: Purchase Document  profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Document</strong> &gt; <strong>Document</strong><strong>Notes</strong>). The note attached to a  document is not printed along with it. It is used primarily for communication  between users within the company.</p>

<p class="example">You can attach a note to a quote on the date  of negotiations with the vendor or about a special discount applicable  for that particular purchase transaction.</p>

<p>You can also set up flow control preferences to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Popup 
 and first show notes attached to the document prior to opening it</strong>  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow</strong><strong>Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Popups</strong>  tab).</li>
  <li><strong>Copy 
 the notes attached to an order to receipt or invoice or attached to a 
 receipt to invoice (when converting an order to receipt/invoice or receipt 
 to invoice)</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow</strong> <strong>Control</strong>  &gt; <strong>Documents</strong> &gt; <strong>Popups</strong>  tab).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">This only applies to notes on an order, receipt,  or invoice. Notes attached to a quote are always copied to the converted  order regardless of this setting.</p>
