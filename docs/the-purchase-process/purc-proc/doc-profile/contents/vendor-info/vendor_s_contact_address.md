# Vendor's Contact Address


The **Contact** field displays the  address of the person who is to be contacted for matters relating to the  purchase document.


**When you select the vendor code, the default  contact address specified in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing** >  **Vendors** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Address**  tab), is displayed in the purchase document profile.**


**If a default address is not defined in  the **Vendor** profile, this field  will be blank. You can change the contact address.**


| **Document Type** | **Contact Address Refers To** |
| Purchase Quote | The name and address of the person with whom negotiations are conducted  for a particular transaction. |
| Purchase Orders, Receipts, and Invoices | The name and address of the person responsible for the fulfillment of  the purchase transaction. |



{:.note}
**Everest**  also allows you to select a billing, contact, shipping or return address  of any other vendor or customer from the **Addresses**  browser. This feature is useful in case the vendor has group companies.  You can select a customerâ€™s contact address if the vendor is also your  customer.
