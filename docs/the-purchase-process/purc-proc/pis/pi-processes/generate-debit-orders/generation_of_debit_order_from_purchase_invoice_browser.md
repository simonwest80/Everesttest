# "Generation of Debit Order from Purchase Invoice" Browser


The "**Generation of Debit Order 
 from** **Purchase Invoice&quot;** browser  is displayed when you select **Options 
 &gt; Utility &gt; Generate Debit Order** from the **Purchase 
 Invoice** profile.


This browser displays all the items on the purchase invoice that do  NOT have links to an existing debit order. All items in this browser are  selected by default.


{:.example}
When you create a debit order from purchase  invoice# 1000 that contains items A and B, both these items are checked  by default in the "**Generation of 
 Debit Order from** **Purchase Invoice&quot;** browser. You may choose to create the debit order for only one  item, say A. Select item A, and select **Options 
 &gt; Create DO** from the browser. After the debit order is created,  item A is no longer displayed in the "**Generation 
 of Debit Order from** **Purchase Invoice&quot;** browser.
