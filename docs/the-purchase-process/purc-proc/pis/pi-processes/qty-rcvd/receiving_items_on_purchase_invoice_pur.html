<p>When you process a purchase order to a purchase invoice, the <strong>Ordered</strong>  column for a line item displays the quantity ordered at the time of conversion.  The <strong>Received</strong> column displays the  quantity committed on the order, if any. If quantity is not committed,  it displays the quantity ordered and not received.</p>

<p>You can set preferences to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Set 
 the quantity received value to zero when converting a purchase order to 
 a purchase receipt or purchase invoice</strong> (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Others</strong> &gt; <strong>Others 1</strong>  tab).</li>
  <li><strong>Prompt 
 the user for updating the last cost, when the last cost of the item changes 
 at the time of creating a purchase invoice</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Prompts</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchase 
 Document</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>
