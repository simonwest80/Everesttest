<p>You can make a payment on a purchase invoice in any of the following  ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make a new  payment on the purchase invoice.</li>
  <li>Apply a debit  memo on the purchase invoice.</li>
  <li>Apply a deposit  on the purchase invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/steps.gif" alt="" />To make a payment on a purchase invoice, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Purchase</strong> <strong>Invoice</strong> profile, select <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Payment</strong> &gt; <strong>Pay</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/pos/po-processes/payments/pmnt-dialog-box/the_payment_dialog.html"><strong>Payment</strong>  dialog box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click the <strong>Pay</strong> option,  <strong>Everest</strong> checks if there are pending  transactions in the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser for that document. If pending transactions are found, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you whether you want to process existing batch payment(s) or receive  a new payment. The prompt also displays the total value of all pending  batch payments for the document.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Process existing batch payments</strong>  to view the <strong>Batch Payment Process</strong>  browser from where you can process the payment. To receive a new payment,  you should have appropriate security rights.</p>

<p class="note">You can also set up prompt preferences to  automatically apply deposits when the order is converted to a invoice  by selecting <strong>Automatic</strong> in the  <strong>Method for applying deposits paid on 
 a purchase order when converting it to a invoice</strong> option (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow</strong><strong>Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow</strong> <strong>Control</strong><strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Prompts</strong>  &gt; <strong>Purchase</strong> tab).</p>
