# Correcting Errors in Purchase Invoices


The following types of errors may occur in a purchase invoice:

- **Vendor 
 information** - If you create a purchase invoice for the wrong vendor,  you can create a debit memo to offset the amount payable or create a manual  purchase journal entry debiting the vendor. You can then create the purchase  invoice for the correct vendor.
- **Item 
 cost/value** - If the item cost (for an inventoried item) is incorrect,  edit the price. The existing purchase journal will update for the cost  difference. If there is quantity received on the invoice, a Cost Adjustment  document will be created for the cost difference of the received quantity.


- **Item 
 cost/value** - If the item cost (for a non-inventoried item) is incorrect,  edit the cost. The existing purchase journal will update for the difference  in cost.
- **Item 
 quantity** - If the item quantity actually invoiced was less or more  than what was entered, edit the quantity. The existing purchase journal  will update for the difference in the invoiced quantity.
- **Payment 
 information** - If the payment terms were not correctly entered and  you are due to receive a discount, create a debit memo for the discount  amount. If a discount is calculated and applied based on the wrong payment  term, you can modify the discount at the time of payment.
- **Allocation 
 to the wrong cost center** - In this case, create a general journal  entry debiting and crediting the relevant account and selecting the cost  centers to and from which the amount has to be re-allocated.
