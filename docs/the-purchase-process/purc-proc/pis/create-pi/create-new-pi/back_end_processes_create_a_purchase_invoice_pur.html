<ul>
  <li>A purchase invoice  is created with the status ‘open’.</li>
  <li>If the purchase  invoice was created by converting an order, and all items ordered are  both fully received and invoiced, the status of the purchase order changes  to ‘closed’. Otherwise, the purchase order remains open with a received  status (not received, partially received, or fully received) and an invoiced  status (not invoiced, partially invoiced, or fully invoiced).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Serial numbers  of serialized/auto-serialized items - If the item is serialized/auto-serialized,  serial numbers are generated for the quantities received that were not  committed. Serial numbers are assigned when the purchase invoice is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>: Serial numbers are generated in a series that starts  from the next serial number assigned in the Location profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location/Sub-Location</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>) for the login  sub-location. If this is blank, the next serial number assigned for the  Default Location (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt;  <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>)  is used.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Last cost of item  - The last cost of the item is updated with the cost on the invoice. The  last cost includes the freight distributed for the item.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="note">
  <li>To be prompted  to update the last cost of an item when you create a purchase invoice,  you must select Always Prompt in the option <strong>When 
 the last cost of an item changes at the time of creating a purchase invoice, 
 how do you wish to prompt the user for updating the last cost</strong> (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Prompts</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchase

 Station Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Stock Bins</strong>  &gt; <strong>For Purchase</strong> tab) to ensure  that the last cost is not updated for documents created from the workstation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The average cost  of the item is updated by adding the value of items received on the invoice  to the value of total stock in “Stock” type of area and dividing it by  total quantity in stock.</li>
</ul>

<p>: Average Cost = (Value of total stock in stock type  of stock areas + Value of items received)/(Existing quantity of total  stock + Quantity received)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value of item includes  add-on costs distributed to the item. The purchase measure is considered  for computing stock for average cost calculations.</li>
  <li>The vendor’s unposted  amount and payable amount increase by the value of invoice. When the Purchase  Journal for the invoice is posted, the posted amount increases and the  unposted amount reduces.</li>
  <li>The vendor’s summary  is automatically updated with the details of the document.</li>
  <li>The low cost, high  cost and purchase history of the item is also automatically updated.</li>
  <li>When quantities  of an item ordered are received on a purchase invoice, the stock status  of the item as viewed in the <strong>Item Stock 
 Status</strong> dialog box displays the following changes:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Item Stock 
 Status</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a  decrease in the quantity of <strong>PO</strong>  for the items received. If the quantity received was committed on order,  the quantity of <strong>PO</strong> <strong>Committed</strong>  reduces.
    <ul>
      <li>There is an  increase in <strong>Total</strong> quantity <em>**</em> of the item.</li>
      <li>There is a  decrease in the <strong>Available</strong> quantity  of the item.</li>
      <li>If the invoice  was against a <strong>Drop</strong> <strong>Shipment</strong>  sales order, the items received are automatically committed to the sales  order and the <strong>SO</strong> <strong>Commit</strong>  for the item increases.
