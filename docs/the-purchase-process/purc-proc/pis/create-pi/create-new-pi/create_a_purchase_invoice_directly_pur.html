<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/img/steps.gif" alt="" />To create a purchase invoice from the purchase  invoice browser, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Purchasing</strong> &gt; <strong>Purchase Invoice</strong>. You will see the  <strong>Purchase Invoices</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Purchase Invoices</strong> browser, select <strong>Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window</strong>.  You will see <a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/pis/create-pi/create-new-pi/pi-profile/the_purchase_invoice_profile_pur.html">The Purchase  Invoice Profile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can also create a purchase invoice from  an existing <strong>Purchase Invoice</strong> profile  by selecting <strong>Options &gt; New</strong>.</p>

<p>You can create a purchase invoice directly  for non-inventoried items. However you can only create a purchase invoice  directly for inventoried line items if the quantity invoiced and the quantity  received on the invoice are same. If the quantity differs the system will  prompt you to update the received quantity. Click <strong>Yes</strong>  to update the Received quantity with the Invoiced quantity. If the <strong>Use default stock bin to receive items when 
 creating a new purchase receipt/invoice</strong> option is unchecked (path:  <strong>Location</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Stock 
 Transfer</strong> tab &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>  tab), the quantity will update in the default bin in the Assign Quantity  profile; you may edit the quantity against other stock bins. If you click  <strong>No</strong>, you cannot save the invoice  without receiving quantity into inventory.</p>
