# Manual Purchase Invoices


When you manually create an entry in a purchase journal crediting the  vendor, a manual purchase invoice is created. The document number is prefixed  with an “**M**” to denote it is a  manual purchase invoice.


If the document number is left blank, the sequence number for manual  purchase invoice for the logged in location or sub-location is used (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Accounting** > **Location**/**Sub-Location** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Purchasing**  tab).


If this number is not assigned, the sequence number assigned to the  **Default Location** (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab) is used.


You can make modifications from within the manual purchase invoice profile.

**View Manual Purchase Invoices**


You can view manual purchase invoices from the **Purchase Invoices** browser by selecting  the **Accounting** option from the  **View** menu (path: **Purchase 
 Invoices** browser > **View**  > **Accounting**). Manual purchase  invoices have a **PI#** that is prefixed  with “M”.  Manual  documents also display “Accounting” in the **Type**  column.


**Modify  Manual Purchase Invoices**


You can modify manual purchase invoices from the  **Purchase Invoice** profile just  as you would with system documents. This is the preferred method for making  manual purchase invoice modifications since only limited modifications  are possible from the purchase journal.
