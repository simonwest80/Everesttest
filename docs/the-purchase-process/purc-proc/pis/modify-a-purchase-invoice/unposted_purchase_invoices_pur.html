<p>Accounting entries for purchase invoices are recorded in system purchase  journals. If the purchase journal in which a purchase invoice is recorded  is NOT posted, you can make the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All item information  for existing non-inventoried items such as cost, job code, tax code and  location/sub-location.</li>
  <li>The item cost,  discount value, discount %, job code, tax code, add-on cost and department  for an inventoried, serialized and auto-serialized items.</li>
  <li>If you change the  line item cost and a related purchase receipt is unposted,  the  system automatically balances the Accrued Purchases account so that the  purchase invoice stays balanced with the purchase receipt. You need adequate  security rights to change the item cost on the invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you modify any of the columns below, a  new entry “Purchase Price Variance Account” gets created in  the <strong>Transactions</strong> tab.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The job code, tax  code and location/sub-location for an inventoried item.</li>
  <li>Tax Invoice Number  and Invoice date</li>
  <li>Purchase Representative</li>
  <li>FOB and Reference</li>
  <li>Vendor’s invoice  number and Date</li>
  <li>Shipment tracking  number</li>
  <li>Location/Sub-Location</li>
  <li>Document policy  and Document alias</li>
</ul>
