<p>You can modify the <strong>Purchase Invoice</strong> profile from the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Purchase 
 Invoice</strong> browser - Highlight the records and select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Purchase 
 Invoice</strong> profile - Specify the document number of the required invoice  in the <strong>Document #</strong> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accounting entries for purchase invoices are recorded in system Purchase  Journals. You can only modify a purchase invoice if it has not been posted.</p>

<p class="hint">To differentiate between purchase invoices  which are posted and unposted, add the field <strong>Is 
 Posted</strong> to the <strong>Purchase</strong><strong>Invoices</strong> browser using the <strong>Field</strong> <strong>Chooser</strong>  option (<strong>Options &gt; Field Chooser</strong>).</p>

<p>You can edit Line Item details in a saved but unposted <strong>Purchase 
 Invoices</strong> profile but you cannot add new inventoried line items  after the invoice is initially saved. You can only add non-inventoried  line items to a saved purchase invoice.</p>

<p>If you increase or decrease the invoiced quantity, the system automatically  balances the Accrued Purchases account.</p>

<p>You need adequate security rights to increase or decrease the invoiced  quantity.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>You are allowed  to edit a previously saved purchase invoice only if you specify an account  in the Purchase Price Variance Account field (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Posting Group</strong> profile).</li>
  <li>The purchase invoice  must belong to an open or active period for you to modify it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever you edit the editable columns for a line item, and it results  in a change in the total value of the line item, certain back-end processes  occur.</p>
