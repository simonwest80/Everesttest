# The Fill Sales Order Browser


The **Fill Sales Order** browser  is displayed once you make the selections and click **OK**  in the **Parts Fulfillment** dialog  box. This browser displays all items on the purchase invoice. Along with  each item, **Everest** displays customer  sales orders that are open for those items, the quantity the order needs  and how many units can be fulfilled using this purchase.

The **Received Quantity** column  displays the Received Quantity on the purchase invoice. This is displayed  when you select the **Received Quantity**  in the **Parts Fulfillment** dialog  box. This field is shown in the purchase measure used in the purchase  invoice.


The **Free Stock** column displays  the free stock available in all the stock bins for the item. This is displayed  when you select **Free** **Stock**  in the **Parts Fulfillment** dialog  box.


The **Qty Needed** and **Can 
 Fill** columns are shown in the sales measure of the sales document.
