      <td>Amount of recoverable tax paid on the items</td>

</table>

<p class="note">If non-inventoried items will not be accounted  for in the purchase receipt, we recommend you enter the received quantity  as equal to the invoiced quantity in the purchase invoice. This will debit  the Asset/Expense account and credit the Accounts Payable account.</p>

<p>If you enter only the invoiced quantity, the  Accrued Purchases account will be debited and Accounts Payable will be  credited. The Accrued Purchases account will be offset only when the received  quantity is entered in the receipt or in the invoice.</p>
