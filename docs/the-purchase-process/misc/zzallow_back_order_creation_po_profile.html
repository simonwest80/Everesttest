<p>Select this check box if partial shipments are allowed on the purchase  order. This option is selected by default if the <strong>Allow 
 Back Order Creation</strong> check box is selected in the <strong>Vendor</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab).  If you do not select this option, the entire order has to be converted  to a purchase receipt; there can be no partial shipments.</p>
