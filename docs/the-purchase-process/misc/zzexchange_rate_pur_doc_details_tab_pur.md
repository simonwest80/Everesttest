title: Exchange Rate
---


The **Exchange Rate** field allows  you to specify the exchange rate between your base currency and the vendor  currency. This field is enabled only in case of foreign currency vendors.


By default, this field displays the latest exchange rate defined in  the **Exchange Rate** profile (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Multi-currency &gt; Exchange Rates &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New 
 Window &gt; Exchange Rates** profile). **Everest**  determines whether the Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on  the setting in the **Rate for Purchase 
 Documents** field (path: **File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency** tab **&gt; Exchange Rates** tab).  Exchange rates can have up to six decimal places. If the exchange rate  for the document is different from the current rate, you can change the  rate.
