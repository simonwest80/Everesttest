# Reduce Document Value Below Paid Amount


After paying the full amount of the purchase order or invoice to the  vendor, if you reduce the value of the document, say by changing the tax  code, **Everest** informs you that  you have overpaid the document. You can choose to save the document with  a negative balance, and apply the overpaid amount to another purchase  order or invoice.
