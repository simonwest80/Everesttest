<p>Accrued Purchases (PI - Invoiced Quantity) = (10 * 10) + 3 = <strong>103</strong></p>

<p>Accrued Purchases (Total Invoiced) - Accrued Purchases (Total Received)  = ACP balance maintained at the line level of the linked documents = 103  - 107 = -4</p>

<p>The Accrued Purchases amount invoiced is 103 and the total Accrued Purchases  amount received is 107. This leaves a credit balance in the ACP account  of 4. The system automatically creates an ACP (Adjustment) debit entry  of 4 to zero out the balance in the ACP account.</p>
