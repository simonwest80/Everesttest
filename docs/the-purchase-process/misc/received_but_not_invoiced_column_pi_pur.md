# Received but not Invoiced Column


When you convert a purchase order or receipt to a purchase invoice,  this column populates with the quantity in the Received column minus the  quantity in the Invoiced column of the purchase order/receipt at the time  you converted it.


When you create a purchase invoice directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column displays a zero.


You cannot edit this column.
