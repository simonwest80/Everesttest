<p class="note">You cannot detach a serial number that was attached  on a purchase order or receipt from the purchase invoice.</p>

<p class="example">If 3 numbers were committed to an order and  the serial numbers generated were 10001 - 10003; but you receive only  two, the unassigned serial number reverts to the order. The serial number  can only be detached from the purchase order.</p>
