**Tax Invoice No.**

**Tax Invoice Date**
: This field allows you to specify the date of receipt  of the vendor’s tax invoice. The field is activated only when you enter  a valid tax invoice number. This date is used to determine the reporting  period when the tax paid on the purchase receipt may be claimed.


**[]()Claimed**
: The **Claimed**  option indicates whether GST/VAT  has been claimed on the document and cannot be edited. When the **Input

The **Claimed**  check box will be selected if you mark the purchase invoice as claimed  in the **Input Claim PI Browser**.  If the Vendor’s tax invoice date has NOT been specified, **Everest** updates the **Tax invoice date**  field with the login date prior to saving the purchase invoice.
