<p>After a purchase, the <strong>Last Cost</strong>  on the <strong>Item</strong> profile <strong>Purchases</strong>  tab is updated in the purchase measure. After that, the <strong>Last 
 Cost</strong> on the <strong>Item</strong> profile  <strong>Inventory</strong> tab is updated in the  stock measure using the conversion factor for the measures.</p>

<p class="example">Stock Measure: PCS</p>

<p>Purchase Measures: Box and Carton</p>

<p>1 Box = 20 PCS</p>

<p>1 Carton = 50 PCS</p>

<p>After you purchase 10 boxes @$30 per box, the <strong>Last 
 Cost</strong> in the <strong>Purchases</strong> tab  updates to $30 for the Box purchase measure. The <strong>Last 
 Cost</strong> in the <strong>Inventory</strong> tab  updates to $1.50 ($30/20).</p>

<p>You decide to also purchase 10 Cartons @$60 per Carton. The <strong>Last 
 Cost</strong> in the <strong>Purchases</strong> tab  updates to $60 for the <strong>Carton</strong>  purchase measure. The <strong>Last Cost</strong>  in the <strong>Inventory</strong> tab updates to  $1.20 ($60/50).</p>
