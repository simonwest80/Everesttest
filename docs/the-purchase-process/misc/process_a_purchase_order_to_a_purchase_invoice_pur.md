# Process a Purchase Order to a Purchase Invoice


A Purchase Invoice is used to make vendor payments on a purchase order  and to receive refunds against the purchase order.


You can process a purchase order to a purchase invoice by using the  **Invoice** option (path: **Purchase 
 Order** profile > **Options**  > **Process** > **Invoice**).  The details of the order are copied to a **Purchase 
 Invoice** profile.


When you save the purchase invoice, the quantity invoiced is updated  to the Invoiced column of the purchase order.
