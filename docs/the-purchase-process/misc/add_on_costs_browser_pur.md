# The Add-on Costs Browser


The **Add-on Costs** browser contains  information available in the **Add-on Cost**  profile. It provides the following options:

- **Discontinue**  – when you discontinue an add-on cost, it no longer appears as an element  for allocating Add-on Costs on new documents or on existing documents  which do not already use it. This does not affect existing documents using  this add-on cost; those documents will process the add-on cost as if it  is still active.
- **View 
 Discontinued** – opens the **Discontinued**  browser where you can view all of the currently discontinued add-on costs  and reactivate any if necessary.
- **Rename 
 Add-on Cost ID** – opens a dialog box which shows the current ID  and allows you to enter a new ID. The **Add-on 
 Cost ID** changes everywhere in the system, including existing and  even posted documents.
