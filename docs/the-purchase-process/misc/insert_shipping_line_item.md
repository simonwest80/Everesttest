# Insert Shipping Line Item


The **Insert Shipping Line Item**  button is enabled when the total add-on costs distributed is less than  the actual [Add-on Costs Amount]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/misc/freight_amount_fdp.html).


Click this button to add a non-inventoried item to which the undistributed  add-on cost is allocated. It is done to ensure that the entire add-on  cost amount is allocated amongst the items.


The item to which shipping charges have to be allocated is selected  in the **Items** dialog box (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Items**).
