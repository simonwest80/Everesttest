<p>After paying the full amount of the purchase order or invoice to the  vendor, if you reduce the value of the document, say by changing the tax  code, <strong>Everest</strong> informs you that  you have overpaid the document. You can choose to save the document with  a negative balance, and apply the overpaid amount to another purchase  order or invoice.</p>
