<ul>
  <li><strong>Distribute</strong>  – Recalculates and redistributes the add-on costs for the highlighted  add-on cost element. If you make a change to the document such as adding  line items or partially receiving items, click this button.</li>
  <li><strong>Distribute 
 All</strong> - Recalculates and redistributes the add-on costs for all of  the add-on cost elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply</strong>  – Saves your changes to the distribution but leaves the dialog box open.  Click this every time you make a change within the dialog box. (If you  make a distribution change and do not click Apply afterwards, the change  does not save when you close the dialog box.)</li>
  <li><strong>OK</strong>  – Saves any changes to the distribution and closes the dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click OK in the Add-on Costs Distribution dialog box for a  purchase invoice, the system checks the top grid. If you have quantity  in both <strong>Received on Invoice</strong> and  <strong>Invoiced</strong> sections but you have  only included an Add-on Cost Amount for one of them, the system alerts  you of the discrepancy and asks if you want to distribute to the one omitted.  If you click Yes, you should add an amount in the top grid and the system  will automatically redistribute the add-on costs. If you click No, the  system saves the document with the add-on costs distributed for only one  quantity.</p>
