# Payment Dialog Box - Prior Payments


This tab is displayed when you refund the payment received from a foreign  currency vendor on a debit order . If you receive advance payments from  the vendor (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab  allows you to indicate the refund that must be applied as a payment.


This tab comprises two sections:

- **Advance 
 Document Available** - Displays all available deposits (i.e., deposits  not applied on a debit memo) on the current debit order.
- **Advance 
 Document Applied** - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the > and >> buttons to move  the available deposits from the **Advance 
 Documents Available** column to this column. You can change the amount  being applied by editing the **Amount**  column.



The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the **Amount**  field (path: **Payment** dialog box  > **General** tab).


When you refund a payment, a transaction is automatically created in  a payment journal (for the amount applied).
