title: Insert Shipping Line Item
---


The **Insert Shipping Line Item**  button is enabled when the total **Add-on 
 Costs** amount distributed is less than the Add-on Costs Amount.  If the total of line item equals or exceeds the total add-on costs, the  **Insert Shipping Line Item Button**  is disabled.


Click this button to add a non-inventoried item to which the undistributed  add-on cost is allocated. It is done to ensure that the entire add-on  cost amount is allocated amongst the items.


The item to which shipping charges have to be allocated is selected  in the **Items** dialog box (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Items**).
