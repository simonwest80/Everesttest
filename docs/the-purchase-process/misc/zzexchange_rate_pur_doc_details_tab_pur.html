<p>The <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field allows  you to specify the exchange rate between your base currency and the vendor  currency. This field is enabled only in case of foreign currency vendors.</p>

<p>By default, this field displays the latest exchange rate defined in  the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Multi-currency &gt; Exchange Rates &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New 
 Window &gt; Exchange Rates</strong> profile). <strong>Everest</strong>  determines whether the Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on  the setting in the <strong>Rate for Purchase 
 Documents</strong> field (path: <strong>File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Exchange Rates</strong> tab).  Exchange rates can have up to six decimal places. If the exchange rate  for the document is different from the current rate, you can change the  rate.</p>
