<p>The <strong>Add-on Costs</strong> browser contains  information available in the <strong>Add-on Cost</strong>  profile. It provides the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Discontinue</strong>  – when you discontinue an add-on cost, it no longer appears as an element  for allocating Add-on Costs on new documents or on existing documents  which do not already use it. This does not affect existing documents using  this add-on cost; those documents will process the add-on cost as if it  is still active.</li>
  <li><strong>View 
 Discontinued</strong> – opens the <strong>Discontinued</strong>  browser where you can view all of the currently discontinued add-on costs  and reactivate any if necessary.</li>
  <li><strong>Rename 
 Add-on Cost ID</strong> – opens a dialog box which shows the current ID  and allows you to enter a new ID. The <strong>Add-on 
 Cost ID</strong> changes everywhere in the system, including existing and  even posted documents.
