# Volume


The **Volume** column displays the  total volume of the items. The total volume is computed using the quantity  of the line items entered in the purchase/purchase return document and  the volume per unit of measure defined in the **Item**  profile (path:**Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; &nbsp;Purchases**  tab - **Freight** column). It is converted  to the volume measure for the logged in country and displayed. Purchase  orders and debit orders consider the quantity in the document’s **Ordered** column; purchase receipts and  debit memos consider the quantity in the document’s **Received**  column. You cannot edit this column.


On a purchase invoice, the volume is shown under both the **Received 
 on Invoice** and **Invoiced**  headings.
