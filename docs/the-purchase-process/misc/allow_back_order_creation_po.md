# Allow Back Order Creation


The **Allow Back Order Creation**  option is displayed only on purchase orders. This option allows you to  indicate if the items on the order can be partially shipped. This option  is selected by default if the **Allow Back 
 Order Creation** check box is selected in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous** tab).  You can select or deselect this option as required.


If you do not select this option, the entire order has to be converted  to a purchase receipt; there can be no partial shipments.
