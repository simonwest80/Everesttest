<h1 id="difference">Difference</h1>

<p>Differences arise when the actual costs distributed are different from  the total costs.</p>

<p>The difference is displayed in this field. The <strong>Add-on 
 Costs</strong> dialog box cannot be saved until the difference is zero.</p>

<p>If the total add-on costs after modification is less than the actual  cost, the <strong>Difference</strong> field displays  the undistributed add-on cost. Undistributed add-on cost is an expense.  This amount is not allocated against any particular item but has to be  expensed.</p>

<p>To add this amount to the order or receipt, click the <strong>Insert 
 Shipping Line Item</strong> button. The non-inventoried item specified in  the <strong>Items</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Items &gt; Default Item used for Shipping Charges</strong>) is added  to the order or receipt.</p>

<p>Differences Due to Rounding Off</p>

<p>There could be differences due to rounding off when add-on costs are  automatically distributed. In this case, the difference is added to the  add-on costs of the first line item.</p>

<p class="example">If $100 is distributed by weight among 3 line  items each weighing 100 kg, then the add-on costs calculated is $33.3333  for each. The total will not add up to $100.</p>

<p>If you modify the distributed add-on costs, you must ensure that the  total distributed amount exactly equals the actual add-on costs amount.</p>
