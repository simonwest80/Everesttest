<h1 id="average-cost-calculation">Average Cost Calculation</h1>

<p>The <strong>Average Cost</strong> of an item  is calculated by adding the total cost of the current stock to the total  cost of the purchase and dividing it by the total number of items in stock  and purchased.</p>

<p class="example">Stock Measure: PCS (Pieces)</p>

<p>Purchase Measures: Box and Carton</p>

<p>1 Box = 20 PCS</p>

<p>1 Carton = 50 PCS</p>

<p>The average cost of the item is $20 and the current stock of the item  is 100 PCS. If you create a PR for 10 boxes at a cost of 180 per box,  the average cost is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>(20*100)  + (180*10)  =   $12.67  per PCS</p>

<p>100 +  (10*20)</p>
