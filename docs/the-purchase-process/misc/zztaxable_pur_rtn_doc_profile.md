This field displays the total value of items that  are subject to tax. This amount excludes discounts allowed, if any.


The line items that are subject to tax have a Tax  Code associated in the Item Details Grid. Tax  inclusive items are included in this total if they have a purchase tax  associated in the item details grid but the tax is stripped out.
