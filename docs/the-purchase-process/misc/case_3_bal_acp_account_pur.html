<h1 id="case-3-partial-shipments---item-costs-are-different---acp-adjustment--entry-is-used">Case 3: Partial Shipments - Item Costs are Different - ACP (Adjustment)  Entry is used</h1>

<p>In Case 3, the cost of the items on the PR is less that on the PO and  PI. This situation creates a balance in the ACP account for the line item  that is offset by the system automatically using an ACP (Adjustment) entry  to the ACP account.</p>

<p>The accounting entries are shown at the bottom of the table.</p>

<p>Accrued Purchases (PR - Received Quantity) = 7 * 9 = 63</p>

<p>Accrued  Purchases (PI - Received Quantity) = 3 * 10 = 30</p>

<p>Accrued Purchases (PI - Invoiced Quantity) = 10 * 10 = <strong>100</strong></p>

<p>Accrued Purchases (Total Invoiced) - Accrued Purchases (Total Received)  = ACP balance maintained at the line level of the linked documents = 100  - 93 = 7</p>

<p>The Accrued Purchases amount invoiced is 100 and the total Accrued Purchases  amount received is 93. This leaves a debit balance in the ACP account  of 7. The system automatically creates an ACP (Adjustment) credit entry  of 7 to zero out the balance in the ACP account.</p>
