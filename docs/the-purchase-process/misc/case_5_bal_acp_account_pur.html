<p>The <strong>Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)</strong>  entry is the amount pertaining to the difference between the ACP amount  of the Invoiced Quantity and ACP amount of the Received Quantity. In this  example, the amount invoiced (325.00) is greater than the amount received  (224.72 + 88.00).</p>

<p>Accrued Purchase (Adjustment) = 325 (ACP - Invoiced) - 312.72 (ACP -  Received) = <strong>12.28</strong></p>

<p>Because of this difference, the balance in the ACP account becomes 12.28  and it should be zero to be balanced. To resolve this, the ACP (Adjustment)  account is automatically credited by the system for 12.28. This entry  is used to bring the ACP account balance to zero. The PPV account is debited  for this amount also since it is the amount used to offset the ACP (Adjustment)  account.</p>

<p>The overall result of the previous accounting entries is as follows:</p>
