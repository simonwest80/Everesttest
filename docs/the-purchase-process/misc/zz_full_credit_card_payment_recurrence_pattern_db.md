Select this option to make advance payment through a credit  card for the purchase order series. This option is enabled only if you  select the **Credit Card Payment**  check box. The entire amount paid is treated as a deposit made to the  vendor.


When the purchase order(s) is/are converted to purchase invoice(s),  the payment is automatically adjusted against the dues on the purchase  invoice(s) depending upon the option you select in the **Method 
 for applying deposit paid on a purchase order when converting it to a 
 purchase invoice** field in the flow control preferences (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow 
 Control** >**Documents** >  **Prompts** > **Purchase 
 Document &nbsp;2**  tab).


When you select the **Full****credit** **card****payment** check box and click **OK** in the **Recurrence****pattern** dialog box, the **Payment** **for****Recurring** **Document**  dialog box is displayed.
