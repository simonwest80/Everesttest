<p>A Purchase Invoice is used to make vendor payments on a purchase order  and to receive refunds against the purchase order.</p>

<p>You can process a purchase order to a purchase invoice by using the  <strong>Invoice</strong> option (path: <strong>Purchase 
 Order</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Process</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoice</strong>).  The details of the order are copied to a <strong>Purchase 
 Invoice</strong> profile.</p>

<p>When you save the purchase invoice, the quantity invoiced is updated  to the Invoiced column of the purchase order.</p>
