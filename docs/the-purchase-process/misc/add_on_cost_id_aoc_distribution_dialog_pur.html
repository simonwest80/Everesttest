<p>User can select Add-on-cost for a new row from the drop down list. All  the active Add-On Cost ID’s display in the list. You may add the same  Add-on Cost element multiple times using the same or different accounts.  You may need to do this when you incur the same sort of expense but payable  to more than one vendor and requires different accounts, or you may want  two different distribution methods for the same expense.</p>

<ul class="example">
  <li>You incurred  Warehouse charges at two different ports en route and you want to call  them Warehouse Expenses, but prefer to select different accounts in this  document (“E120- Warehouse Exp at Port A” and “E180 - Warehouse Exp at  Port B”) to keep track of the amounts. It is not mandatory that the accounts  should be different in such cases. If accounts are different, then they  will get accounted in different line entries in  the  journal for FOB type Origin.</li>
  <li>You convert  two purchase orders to a single purchase invoice. You incurred Customs  Duty on one purchase order based on weight and on the other based on the  amount. Because the add-on costs do not carry forward when combining multiple  documents, you must manually add the add-on costs into the Add-on Costs  Distribution dialog box. You can use the add-on cost element “Customs  Duty” once with the User Specified distribution method and add the customs  duties together, or you can list the Customs Duty element twice using  the weight and amount distribution methods.</li>
