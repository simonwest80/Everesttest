<p>These columns indicate the tax and recoverable tax relevant to the items  invoiced on the purchase invoice. The amounts in these columns change  if the purchase invoice is in <strong>Received</strong>  view. In <strong>Received</strong> view, these  columns reflect the tax amounts relevant to the items received on the  purchase invoice. The system uses these amounts to calculate the non-recoverable  tax amount. You can change the purchase invoice to <strong>Received</strong>  view by selecting <strong>Options</strong> &gt;  <strong>View Received Amounts</strong>.</p>
