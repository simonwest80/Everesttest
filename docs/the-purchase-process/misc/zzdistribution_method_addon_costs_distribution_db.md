The add-on costs can be distributed on any of the following basis:


| Option | Select this option to: |
| Weight | Distribute add-on costs automatically, in proportion to the weight of  the items. The weight of the item quantities is converted to kilograms  based on the weight defined in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; <br/> Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Freight &gt; Purchase**  tab). |
| Value | Distribute add-on costs in proportion to the value of the items as displayed  on the document profile. |
| Volume | Distribute add-on costs automatically in proportion to the volume of  the items. The volume of the item quantities is converted to liters (for  liquid volume) or cubic centimeters (for solid volume) based on the volume  defined in the **Item** profile (path:  **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Options &gt; <br/> Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Freight - Purchase** tab).<br/><br/><br/>![]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â Volumes  can be expressed either as a liquid measure or a solid measure. This option  can be selected only if the volume of all items on the document is expressed  as the same type of measure. If one item is a liquid and the other is  a solid, this option is disabled. |
| User Specified | Enter the add-on costs manually for each item. |
