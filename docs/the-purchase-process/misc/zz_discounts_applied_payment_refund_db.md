title: Discounts Call Back
---


If you return an item, a proportionate amount of discount may be deducted  from the discount originally allowed to you, while receiving the refund.  If you enter the entire amount as a refund, the **Discount 
 call back** field displays the total amount of **Discount 
 applied** on the purchase receipt. If you enter a partial amount,  this field displays a proportionate amount in the **Discount 
 call back** field.


The amount you enter in the **Discount 
 call back** field cannot be greater than the total payment discount  on the document. If you enter a higher amount, **Everest**  informs you of the same, and does not allow you to proceed.


The amount of payment discount, as displayed in the **Payment 
 Discount** field of the document profile, is reduced by the total  discount called back.


{:.note}
This field is not enabled for refund on a debit memo.  This field is displayed in a purchase receipt if a payment discount is  received on the document.
