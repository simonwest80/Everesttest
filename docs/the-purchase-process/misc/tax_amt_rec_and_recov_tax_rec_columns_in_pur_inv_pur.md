# Tax Amount and Recoverable Tax Columns in Purchase Invoices


These columns indicate the tax and recoverable tax relevant to the items  invoiced on the purchase invoice. The amounts in these columns change  if the purchase invoice is in **Received**  view. In **Received** view, these  columns reflect the tax amounts relevant to the items received on the  purchase invoice. The system uses these amounts to calculate the non-recoverable  tax amount. You can change the purchase invoice to **Received**  view by selecting **Options** >  **View Received Amounts**.
