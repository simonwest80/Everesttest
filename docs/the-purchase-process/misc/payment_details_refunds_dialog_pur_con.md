**Document Amount**

**Already Paid**

 Paid** label to view the **Payment 
 History**.


**Discount Applied**
: This field displays the amount of discount allowed  by the vendor when you make a payment. The discount applied is displayed  in the **Payment Discount** field  of the purchase receipt.


**Discount Call Back**
: If you return an item, a proportionate amount of  discount may be deducted from the discount originally allowed to you,  while receiving the refund. If you enter the entire amount as a refund,  the **Discount call back** field displays  the total amount of **Discount applied**  on the purchase receipt. If you enter a partial amount, this field displays  a proportionate amount in the **Discount 
 call back** field.
: The amount you enter in the **Discount 
 call back** field cannot be greater than the total payment discount  on the document. If you enter a higher amount, **Everest**  informs you of the same, and does not allow you to proceed. The amount  of payment discount, as displayed in the **Payment 
 Discount** field of the document profile, is reduced by the total  discount called back.

 call back** fields are visible in purchase receipts and debit memos  if a payment discount is received on the document.
