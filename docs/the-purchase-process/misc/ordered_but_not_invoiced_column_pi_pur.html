<h1 id="ordered-but-not-invoiced-column">Ordered but not Invoiced Column</h1>

<p>When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, this column  is populated with the quantity in the Ordered column minus the quantity  in the Invoiced column of the purchase order at the time it was converted.</p>

<p>When you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, or when you  create a purchase invoice directly (without first creating a purchase  order or receipt), this column displays a zero.</p>

<p>You cannot edit this column.</p>
