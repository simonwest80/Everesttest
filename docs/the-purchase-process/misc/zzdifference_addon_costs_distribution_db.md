title: Difference
---


Differences will arise when the actual costs that have been distributed  are different from the total costs.


The difference between the total add-on costs distributed and the actual  add-on costs amount is displayed in this field. The add-on costs distribution  cannot be saved until the difference is zero.


If the total add-on costs after modification is less than the freight  amount, then the **Difference** field  displays the amount of add-on costs that is undistributed. Undistributed  add-on costs are an expense. This amount is not allocated against any  particular item but has to be expensed.


To add this amount to the order or receipt, click on the **Insert 
 Shipping Line Item** button; the non-inventoried item specified for  add-on costs will be added to the order or receipt.
