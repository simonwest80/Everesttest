# Invoiced but not Received Column


When you convert a purchase order to a purchase receipt, this column  populates with the quantity in the Invoiced column minus the quantity  in the Received column of the purchase order at the time you converted  it.


When you create a purchase receipt directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column displays a zero.


When you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, this column  updates when you save the invoice. It displays the Invoiced value from  the purchase invoice minus the Received value of the purchase receipt  and the Received on Invoice value of the purchase invoice (the invoiced  quantity minus all quantities received in both documents). The receipt  also updates with each invoice if you convert it to multiple purchase  invoices.


You cannot edit this column.
