<p>The due date for a document is calculated by the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/doc-profile/contents/tabs/details/payment-information/due_date.html">Due  Date</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/purc-proc/doc-profile/contents/tabs/details/payment-information/terms_purchases.html">Terms</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The due date for a purchase quote or an order  is not relevant as the items have not been received and payments are not  due.</p>
