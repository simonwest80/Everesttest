title: Allow Back Order Creation
---


Select this check box if partial shipments are allowed on the purchase  order. This option is selected by default if the **Allow 
 Back Order Creation** check box is selected in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous** tab).  If you do not select this option, the entire order has to be converted  to a purchase receipt; there can be no partial shipments.
