# Attach Committed Items - Auto-Serialized Items


In case of an auto-serialized item, the **Committed**  column displays the quantity committed with the suffix ‘a’ indicating  the item is auto-serialized.


You must attach auto-serialized items to debit orders/memos in the same  manner as serialized items.
