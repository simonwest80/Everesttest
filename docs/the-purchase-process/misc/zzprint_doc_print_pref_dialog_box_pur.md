Specify the details to print for Purchase Invoices. This option only  applies to Purchase Invoices.


If **Invoice Details** is selected  (default), the system prints an Invoiced column and the fields taxable,  tax, exempt, and total relate to the invoiced quantity. If **Receipt 
 Details** is selected, the system replaces the Invoiced column with  a Received column, and the fields relate to the received on invoice quantity.
