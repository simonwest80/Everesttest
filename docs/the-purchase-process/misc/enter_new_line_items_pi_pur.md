# Enter New Line Items


When you save an invoice created from a purchase order or receipt, if  you entered line items into the invoice not included in the purchase order/receipt,  the system will ask if you would like to receive the invoiced quantity  into inventory. The same message appears if you add invoiced items to  a purchase invoice created directly.


If you select **Yes**, the quantity  in the Received column will increase by the invoiced quantity and may  be edited; however, the quantity received on the invoice cannot exceed  the invoiced quantity. If Use Default Stock Bin is unchecked in the logged  in location, the quantity will be updated in the default bin in the Assign  Quantity dialog box.


If you select **No**, you can save  the invoice without receiving quantity into inventory.


You need adequate security rights the save the invoice if the quantity  received on the invoice is less than the invoiced quantity for new line  items.
