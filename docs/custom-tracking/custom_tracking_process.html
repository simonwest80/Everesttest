<h1 id="custom-tracking-process">Custom Tracking Process</h1>

<p>The custom tracking process involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Creating 
 tracking groups</strong> - A tracking group defines the information that  is required. For instance, you can create a tracking group called, ‘How  did you hear about us?’ for customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Identifying 
 choices</strong> - Within the group, choices are available for selection.  For example, you may create ‘Newspaper ad’,  ‘TV ad’ and  ‘Company website’  as choices for the group ‘How did you hear about us?’</li>
  <li><strong>Tagging 
 data</strong> - This can be done with the appropriate choice. For example,  when a customer is created, the sales representative can find out how  the customer heard about you and tag the response to the customer.</li>
</ul>
