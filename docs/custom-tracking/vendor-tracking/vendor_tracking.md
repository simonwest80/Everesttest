# Vendor Tracking


A few examples of how custom tracking can be used to track vendors are  listed below:

- **Obtaining 
 data for further analysis** - You can generate a tracking group called  ‘Vendor size’  and create choices for ‘Sales under $1 million’,  ‘Sales between $1 million - $5 million’  and ‘Sales greater than $5 million’.  When a new vendor is created or if the vendor expands business, you must  tag the vendor with the appropriate choice. This will help you analyze  your vendors by business size.
- **Aiding 
 contact management** - You can have a tracking group called ‘Contact  method’ with  choices of ‘E-mail’, ‘Snail mail’,  ‘Telephone’ or ‘Personal visit’.
- **Aiding 
 purchase decisions** - You can create a tracking group called ‘Lead  Time for Supplies’  with choices of ‘24 hours’, ‘Less than a week’  and ‘Under two weeks’.
- **Rating 
 vendors** - You can create a tracking group called ‘Service Satisfaction’  with choices of ‘Satisfied’, ‘Unhappy’ and ‘Can be improved’.
