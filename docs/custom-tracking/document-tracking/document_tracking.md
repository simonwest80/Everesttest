# Document Tracking


A few examples of how custom tracking can be used to track sales and  purchase documents are given below:

- **Assigning 
 status** - You can have a tracking group called ‘Quote Approval’  for purchase quotes with choices of ‘Quote approved by manager,’ ‘Quote  under review’,  ‘Quote under negotiation’  or ‘Quote rejected’.
- **Tracking 
 progress** - You can generate a tracking group called ‘Shipment Status’  for sales orders with choices of ‘Shipment delayed’,  ‘Shipment in process’  and ‘Shipped’.
- **Ranking 
 data** - You can create a tracking group called ‘Order Priority’  for sales orders with choices of ‘Immediate’, ‘Normal’, ‘High’ and ‘Low’.
