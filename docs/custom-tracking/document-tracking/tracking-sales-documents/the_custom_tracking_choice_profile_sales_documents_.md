# The Custom Tracking Choice Profile (Purchase and Sales Documents)


Use the **Custom Tracking Choice**  profile to specify details of the tracking choice being generated.


**Code**
: **Everest**  by default assigns a unique code to the custom tracking choice that is  generated.


**Description**
: Enter the description of the custom tracking choice  using a maximum of 40 characters of any type. This is a mandatory field.


**Web-enabled**
: Check this option, if you want the tracking choice  created for a tracking group to be available on your **Everest 
 E-Commerce** store. The choices are available on your **Everest 
 E-Commerce** store only if the tracking group of the choices is also  Web-enabled.


**Display Notes Online**
: Check this option, if you want the additional information  that you give as ‘Notes’ to be available on your **Everest****E-Commerce** store along with the  custom tracking choice.
: ![]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) This option is applicable only to  the custom tracking choice for customers.


**Default**
: Check this option, to create a particular choice  as the default tracking choice for a new Purchase or Sales Document. When  you create a new item, it will be automatically tagged with the tracking  choice you have set as the default.
: The default tracking choice is not applied in the  following scenario:

- If you have already  selected a tracking choice by way of checking the option **Transfer 
 tags across documents** in the **Custom 
 Tracking Group** profile > **General**  tab.

: AND

- You have not checked  the option **Allow multiple tracking selections**  in the **Custom Tracking Group** profile  > **General** tab.
