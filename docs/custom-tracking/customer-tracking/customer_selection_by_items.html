<p>Include List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the Include List grid with details  such as item code, description, total stock etc. You will have to select  the items in the Include List that a customer must have purchased from  you.</p>

<p>A customer is included in the generated list, if he has purchased at  least one of the items selected in the <strong>Include</strong><strong>list</strong>.</p>

<p>Exclude List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the <strong>Exclude</strong><strong>list</strong> grid with details such as  item code, description, total stock etc. You will have to select the items  in the <strong>Exclude</strong> <strong>list</strong>  that a customer must not have purchased.</p>
