<p>A few examples of how custom tracking can be used to track customers  are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Obtaining 
 data for further analysis</strong> - You can generate a tracking group called  ‘Customer size’ and create choices like ‘Revenue under $1 million,’ ‘Revenue  between $1 million’ - $5 and ‘Revenue greater than $5 million’. When a  customer is created, or if the customer expands business, you must tag  the customer with the appropriate choice. This will help you analyze your  customers by business size.</li>
  <li><strong>Aiding 
 contact management</strong> - You can create a tracking group called ‘Contact  Method’ with choices ‘E-mail’, ‘Snail mail, ‘Telephone’ or ‘Personal Visit’.</li>
  <li><strong>Planning 
 sales efforts</strong> - You can create a tracking group named ‘Information  Requests’ with choices ‘Brochures’, ‘Demos, ‘CD’ and ‘Have sales rep.  call’.</li>
  <li><strong>Analyzing 
 feedback</strong> - You can create a tracking group called ‘Feedback on  customer service’ with choices ‘Satisfied’, ‘Unhappy’ and ‘Can be improved’.</li>
  <li><strong>Assigning 
 priorities</strong> -You can create a tracking group called ‘Customer priority’  with choices ‘Most important’, ‘Important’, and ‘Normal’, thereby allowing  you to place more emphasis on customers with greater value.</li>
</ul>
