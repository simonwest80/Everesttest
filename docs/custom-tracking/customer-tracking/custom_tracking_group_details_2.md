# Custom Tracking Group Details


The **Custom** **Tracking****Group** profile (path: **Custom****Tracking** **Setup**  - **Customer** browser > **Options** > **New**  > **Group** > **In****New** **Window**)  allows you to create a Custom Tracking group for Customers.


General Information


This section gives you details regarding the **General**  tab of the **Custom Tracking Group** profile.


**Group Code**
: Group code is the unique number assigned to the  custom tracking group. It is automatically generated when you save a new  custom tracking group.


**Description**
: The description identifies the tracking group. The  description must specify the information that is to be obtained.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Descriptions  can be self-explanatory like ‘How Did You Hear About Us’, or ‘Approval  Status’.


**Allow multiple selections to be tagged**
: Using this option, a particular record can be tagged  with more than one selection for the group.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  For  the tracking group 'Featured Items' with choices ‘Exclusive Items’, ‘New  Arrivals’ and ‘Season Special’, an item can be tagged with more than one  choice.


**Force tag at least one selection**
: This option makes tagging with at least one choice  compulsory.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  When  a new item is created or when the profile of an existing item is accessed,  the item profile cannot be closed without tagging the item with one of  the choices for the defined group ‘Featured items’.


**Refresh tag date if memo is updated**
: When a customer is tagged with a choice, **Everest**  records the date of tagging. This option ensures that whenever you modify  the notes to the choice, the tag date gets updated with the date of modification.  You can also give additional information for the choice as Notes.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  a customer is tagged with the choice ‘Telephone’ for the group ‘How can  we contact you?,’ you can add a note to the choice that the customer prefers  to be called on his mobile.


**Security Description**
: This field denotes the security right for access  to the custom tracking group created.
: Only those users who are assigned with this security  right can tag any selection belonging to this group.
