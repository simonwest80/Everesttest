<p>Include List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the <strong>Include 
 list</strong> grid.</p>

<p>To select an item in the <strong>Include List</strong>  that a customer must have purchased from you, highlight it. To select  another item, use Shift + mouse-click or Ctrl + mouse-click.</p>

<p>To select all items in the <strong>Include 
 list</strong> grid, choose <strong>Select All</strong>  from the right-click menu. To deselect all items, choose <strong>Unselect 
 All</strong> from the right-click menu.</p>

<p>Exclude List</p>

<p>All items in the database are listed in the <strong>Exclude 
 list</strong> grid.</p>

<p>To select an item in the <strong>Exclude List</strong>  that a customer must not have purchased from you, highlight it. To select  another item, use Shift + mouse-click or Ctrl + mouse-click.</p>

<p>To select all items in the <strong>Exclude 
 list</strong> grid, choose <strong>Select All</strong>  from the right-click menu. To deselect all items, choose <strong>Unselect 
 All</strong> from the right-click menu.</p>

<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>. You will see the <strong>Tracking Selections</strong> browser listing  the customers based on the items selected in the <strong>Include</strong>  and <strong>Exclude</strong> lists.</p>

<p>All customers who have purchased at least one of the items selected  in the <strong>Include List</strong> and who have  not purchased any item selected in the <strong>Exclude 
 list</strong> is displayed in the <strong>Tracking 
 Selections</strong> browser.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/note.gif" alt="" />  It  is easy to spot an item in the grid, if you know the item code. You can  enter the item code in the field provided in the <strong>Include</strong>  list and <strong>Exclude</strong> list grids. Whichever  item matches the code entered is visible in the grid.</p>
