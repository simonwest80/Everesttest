<p>Custom tracking allows you to track data based on the information criteria  you define. It transforms your database from a static state with pre-defined  fields to a dynamic pool of information that can be used by various functional  groups.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  The  information requirement from your customer database may not be limited  to address and payment information. You may need information on how the  customers heard about you, their geographic areas, their business size  or the competitor’s products that they were using before purchasing your  products.</p>

<p>Custom tracking allows you to define any number of tracking parameters  that you can use to analyze data. <strong>Everest</strong>  also provides you with the analytical tools and reports to derive data,  based on the specified parameters.</p>
