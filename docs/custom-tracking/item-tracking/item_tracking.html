<p>A few examples of how custom tracking can be used to track items are  provided below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showcasing 
 items on your Everest E- 
 Commerce store</strong> -You can create a custom tracking group called ‘Featured  Items’ with the following choices: ‘Best Sellers’, ‘On Sale’, and ‘New  Arrivals’. The tracking group is displayed on the storefront with links  to each choice, and items tagged with these choices</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Group 
 items for inventory control</strong> - Items can be classified as A, B and  C or High, Medium and Low based on the value or priority for inventory  control and analysis. You can create custom tracking groups such as ‘ABC  Analysis’ with choices A, B and C or ‘Item Priority’ with choices ‘High’,  ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales 
 Management</strong> - If you have different exchange policies for different  items, you can tag items on which no exchange is allowed to the choice  ‘No Exchange’. Thus sales persons can inform customers about such items.</li>
</ul>
