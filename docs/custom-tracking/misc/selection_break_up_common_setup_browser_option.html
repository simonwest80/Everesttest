<p>The <strong>Selection break-up</strong> option  in the <strong>Custom Tracking Setup</strong> browser  provides a percentage breakup of tracking selections made for a tracking  group in the specified period.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  If  the customer tracking group ‘How did you hear about us?’ has been tagged  with the selection ‘Web’ 10 times, the selection ‘Newspaper’ 15 times  and the selection ‘TV’ 5 times, the percentage breakup of each choice  is calculated by dividing the number for each selection by the total number  for all selections. The percentage of ‘Web’ would be 10/ 30, of ‘Newspaper’  15/30 and of ‘TV’ 5/30.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  selection breakup is calculated based on the total number of tracking  choices made and not the total number of records tracked. If a tracking  group allows multiple selections, the total number of selections will  be all selections made for each record.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" />  In  the above example, if the tracking group ‘How did you hear about us?’  allows multiple selections  if a customer has been tagged to all  choices, the total selections would include 3 tags for that customer.</strong></p>
