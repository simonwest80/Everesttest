<h1 id="upper-section---custom-tracking-list-dialog-box-vendors">Upper Section - Custom Tracking List Dialog Box (Vendors)</h1>

<p>Tracking groups and tracking selections are displayed in the upper section  of the dialog box. This section contains the <strong>Include 
 List</strong> and the <strong>Exclude List</strong> from  which you can select the required groups and choices.</p>

<p><strong>Include List</strong></p>

<p>This list enables you to include the tracking options you would like  to consider, in order to generate the vendor list. When you select custom  tracking choices in the <strong>Include List</strong>,  all vendors tagged with any of the choices selected are displayed in the  vendor list.</p>

<p>You can select the custom tracking choices in the <strong>Include 
 List</strong> by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.</p>

<p>Exclude List</p>

<p>This list allows you to generate the vendor list for vendors NOT tagged  with any of the choices selected. When you select custom tracking choices  in the <strong>Include List</strong> and <strong>Exclude List</strong>, all vendors tagged with  any of the choices selected in the <strong>Include 
 List</strong> and not tagged with any of the choices selected in the <strong>Exclude List</strong> are displayed in the vendor  list.</p>

<p>You can select the custom tracking choices in the <strong>Exclude 
 List</strong> by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/custom-tracking/img/note.gif" alt="" />  If  the same tracking choices are selected in both the <strong>Include</strong> and <strong>Exclude</strong> lists   the custom tracking list for vendorare generated based on the choices  selected in the <strong>Include List,</strong> and  the <strong>Exclude List</strong> would be ignored.</p>
