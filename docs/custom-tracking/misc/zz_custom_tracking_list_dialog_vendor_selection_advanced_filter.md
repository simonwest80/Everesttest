title: Advanced Filter

Check the box adjacent to the **Advanced 
 filter** to set conditions for generating the vendor list and check  **And** or **Or**  as per your requirements in the Include List and Exclude List fields.


If you choose **AND** for the **Group** both the selected tracking groups  must apply. If you select **OR** then  either of the tracking groups must apply. The same logic applies to the  tracking Selections.
