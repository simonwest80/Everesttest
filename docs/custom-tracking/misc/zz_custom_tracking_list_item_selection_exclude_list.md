title: Exclude List
---


This list allows you to generate the item list for items that have NOT  been tagged with any of the choices selected. When you select custom tracking  choices in the **Include List** and  **Exclude List**, all items that have  been tagged with any of the choices selected in the **Include 
 List** and that are not tagged with any of the choices selected in  the **Exclude List** are displayed  in the item list.


You can select the custom tracking choices in the **Exclude 
 List** by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.
