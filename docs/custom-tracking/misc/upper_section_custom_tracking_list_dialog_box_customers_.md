Tracking groups and tracking selections are displayed in the upper section  of the dialog box. This section contains the **Include 
 List** and the **Exclude List** from  which you can select the required groups and choices.


**Include List**


This list enables you to include the customers tagged with any of the  choices you select. When you select custom tracking choices, all customers  tagged with any of the choices selected are displayed in the customer  list.


You can select the custom tracking choices by checking the box beside  the choices listed under each group.

 List**, all customers tagged with any of the choices selected in  the **Include List** and not tagged  with any of the choices selected in the **Exclude 
 List** are displayed in the customer list.

 List** by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.
