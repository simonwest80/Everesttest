# Selection Break-up


The **Selection Break-up** option  provides a percentage breakup of tracking choices made for a tracking  group in the specified period. When you select this option, you is  prompted to specify the date range for which you want the selection break-up.  Click **OK** after specifying the  **From** and **To**  dates.


You will see a summary break up in the form of a pie chart. The selection  break-up is indicated for all tracking choices belonging to the selected  tracking group (to which item/kits are tagged) during the specified  date range.


Place your cursor over each slice of the pie chart to view the number  of item/kits that are tagged to the tracking choice. You can also  view these details by turning on the data editor.
