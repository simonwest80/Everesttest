 Selections (Customer)** browser comprises the following options:


**Unique Match**


Select this option to view only unique records that match the selection  criteria.


**All Matches**

{:.example}
Customer Aavik Martin is tracked to the Customer  Tracking Group **Preferred method of support**  and tagged to the choices â€“ **E-mail Support 
 and Phone Support**.


When you specify this tracking group and choices  in the **Selection Criteria for Customer
