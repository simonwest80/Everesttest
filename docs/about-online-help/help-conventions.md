* Important information is represented with the "Note" symbol as seen below:

   {:.note}
   This paragraph is an example of the "Note" convention. You will see the icon on the left side of the page with the information beside it.

* Additional information for a particular field is indicated by the symbol given below:

   {:.lens}
   [The Topic Name]()

   Click the hyperlink to view more information on the given topic.

* Information related to a particular topic is provided at the end of that topic. The related information is indicated by the symbol given below:

   [The Topic Name]()

   Click the hyperlink to view the related information on the given topic.

* The Refer icon is used to point to information outside the online help.

   {:.refer}
   With this convention, you will see the icon on the left side of the page, (aligned with the heading it forms a part of) and the text appears adjacent to it.

* Examples are provided to illustrate the information presented. An example is depicted by the symbol given below:

   {:.example}
   With this convention, you will see the icon on the left side of the page with the example beside it.

* Hints provide suggestions to enable you to quickly accomplish a given task. Hints are indicated by the symbol given below:

   {:.hint}
   This paragraph is an example of the "Hint" convention. You will see the icon on the left side of the page with the text beside it.

* When you require salient information without which you cannot proceed with a particular operation, the "Warning" symbol is used.

   {:.warn}
   This paragraph is an example of the "Warning" convention. You will see the icon on the left side of the page with the text beside it.

* Menu options, Window/Dialog Box names, Field names and Buttons that appear in the software are displayed in **Bold**.
* Navigation across menu options is represented by the symbol " > ".

   {:.example}
   To view the **Categories** browser, you must first click **Inventory**, and then **Categories**. This is illustrated in the document/online help as follows:
   
   From the main menu bar, select **Inventory** > **Categories**.

* Wherever it is necessary to perform a sequence of tasks for a particular function, the "Steps" icon is used. This is indicated by the symbol given below:

   {:.steps}
   You will see the icon on the left side of the page with the text beside it, indicating that the steps to carry out a task are listed.

* When you open a profile to create a record, the title bar of the profile displays the profile name along with the message "**To be generated**".

   {:.note}
   Once you save the profile, the message "**To be generated**" is no longer displayed in the title bar. This message is, therefore, not mentioned in the **Everest Advanced Edition** online help.
