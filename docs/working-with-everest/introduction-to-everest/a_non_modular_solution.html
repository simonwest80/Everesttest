<p><strong>Everest</strong> is designed as a non-modular  solution. For an enterprise to work at its optimum, all of its component  subsystems must work in tandem. This cannot be achieved by disparate systems  running diverse functions. <strong>Everest</strong>  addresses the specific needs of individual functions and simultaneously  ensures that these functions seamlessly blend with one another.</p>
