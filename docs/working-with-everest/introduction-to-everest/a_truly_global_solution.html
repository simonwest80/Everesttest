<p><strong>Everest</strong> works for businesses  which are global in nature. It is especially suited for businesses that  have operations in more than one country. You can configure <strong>Everest</strong>  to deal with country-specific requirements such as taxes, time zones,  reports, addresses and zip codes, telephone formats, and currencies.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> is also multi-currency  enabled. It handles complex transactions that involve more than two currencies  and automatically computes the gain or loss on foreign exchange transactions.</p>
