# Advanced Find


This tab facilitates an advanced search and you can specify multiple  search parameters. This is a more complex option than the other tabs in  the **Find** filters, and is extremely  useful to narrow down your search to meet your requirements.


The parameters chosen in any of the tabs (such as **Quick 
 Find**) are listed here. If required, you can modify some of the  conditions.


{:.example}
In the **Find Tasks/Appointments**  dialog box, choose the following parameters to construct a condition to  find completed tasks related to purchase quotes and purchase invoices:


**Quick Find** tab: Select Tasks  and Completed only


**Document/Account** tab: Select  Purchase Quotes and Purchase Invoices in the **Purchase 
 Document Type** field.


Based on these specifications, the following condition is displayed  in the **Advanced Find** tab:


Contact management module in 2 and


Status equals T  and


Document type in (1,3)


The condition statement can be edited to suit your search requirements.


{:.note}
You cannot edit all parameters in the **Advanced 
 Find** condition. Only the parameters which have an enabled check  box (that can be selected/deselected)  beside them can be edited.


The parameters that are changed/edited in the **Advanced 
 Find** tab do not get automatically updated in the other tabs.


{:.example}
The condition statement can be edited to find tasks related to sales  quotes and sales invoices, that have been completed by a selected sales  representative. It can be altered in the following way:


Contact management module in 2 and


Status equals T  and
