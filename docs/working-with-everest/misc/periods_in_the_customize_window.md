**Fiscal Year**
: The fiscal year is a calculated year in which the  relevant date falls. This is computed based on the fiscal year of the  login date. **Everest** works backwards  from the fiscal year of the login date and calculates the 12-month period  in which the transaction date of the document falls.


{:.example}
If the fiscal year for the login date is April 2004 - March 2005 and  the transaction date is December 23, 2003, then the fiscal year displayed  is 04-01-2003 to 12-31-2004.
: This year may differ from the actual fiscal year  when the document was created.


{:.example}
If the fiscal year was the calendar year until 2003 after which you  changed the fiscal year to the period April - March; then the fiscal year  column in the browser will still show the calculated fiscal year.


**Year Week**

If the fiscal year for the login date is April 1, 2004 to March 31,  2005 and the transaction date is December 23, 2003, then the fiscal year  displayed is 04-01-2003 to 12-31-2004 and the year week displayed is 39.


**Month Week**
: The month week is the week of the month (such as  the 2nd or 4th) in the calculated fiscal year for the relevant date.
