<p>You can add a text box on the <strong>Label 
 Design Area</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Add 
 Text Box</strong> icon from the standard tool bar. You can also add a text  box by selecting the <strong>Add Text Box</strong>  option from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu or by  right clicking on the <strong>Label Design Area</strong>.  Many text boxes can be created.</p>

<p class="example">To make a label for all items that are on  seconds sale, choose ‘Add text box’ from the right-click menu and enter  ‘Seconds Sale’. As a combination, you can choose the item code, the item  description and item price from the browser fields. Thus, you create a  label with ‘Seconds Sale’  as the caption, and item code, description and price as the label components.  You can then print this label and attach it to the items that are on sale.</p>
