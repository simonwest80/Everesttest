# Utility of 3D Charts


The advantages of implementing 3D charts in browsers are that each functional  group in the organization can create the charts and comparisons that they  want based on their requirements.


{:.example}
**Sales** can derive graphs such  as Yearly Sales by Sales Representative and Yearly Sales by Location/Sub-location.


**Purchasing** can derive graphs  such as Monthly Purchases by Vendor or Purchases by Location/Sub-location  by Vendor.


**Finance** can derive reports such  as Monthly Sales Taxes by Jurisdiction that will help in Sales Tax payments.


**Payroll** department would be  able to obtain graphs for comparison of payroll expenses based on location/sub-location  and periods. For example, reports such as Monthly Payroll Expenses by  Payroll Item, or Yearly Payroll Expenses by location/sub-location.


**Management** can obtain graphs  for comparing incomes within years or from year to year. Reports such  as Quarterly Performance Comparison will give the management a view of  Sales in Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 by location/sub-location. Likewise for costs.
