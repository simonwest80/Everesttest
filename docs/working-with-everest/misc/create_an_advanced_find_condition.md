# Create an Advanced Find Condition


You can also create an **Advanced Find**  condition, instead of editing an existing condition.


{:.example}
You can define a condition to find vendors who are neither from the  United States, nor United Kingdom, and who have purchase representative  Jack Avalon assigned to them.


{:.steps}
To define the above mentioned condition,  do the following:

- From the main menu,  select **Purchasing &gt; Find Vendors**.  You will see the **Find Vendors**  dialog box.
- Select the **Advanced Find** tab.
- In the display  panel, click . You will see the following parameter: ‘Account Code contains  <?>’.
- Click ‘Account  Code’. From  the drop-down list, select ‘Country’.
- Click ‘contains’.  From the drop-down list, select ‘doesn’tcontain’.
- Click ‘<?>’.  Enter ‘United’ in the text box.
- Similarly, construct  the parameter ‘Purchase Rep in JA’.  Click **Find**.
- The records matching  the search criteria are displayed.



You can add more parameters to the Advanced Find condition statement,  to narrow your search.


{:.example}
You can add another parameter to find only vendors whose assigned location/sub-location  is in Australia:


'location/sub-location Code contains AUS’
