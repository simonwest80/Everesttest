title: Y-Axis

Specify whether the Y-axis should display the value of the records or  the number of records in the selected criteria. If **Value**  is selected, choose a numeric field for the field in the Y-axis column.  If **Record Count** is selected,  you cannot select a field for the Y-axis since the number of records for  the criteria specified in the X- and Z-axis is displayed here.


{:.example}
Say you want to find out the number of sales  invoices created by each sales representative in the fiscal year 2001.  Select **record count** in the **Y-axis**. Enter the title for Y-axis in  **Enter title for Y-axis** field.  Select 'Year' as the field in the **X-axis 
 column** and 'Rep.' as the field in the **Z-axis****column**. Click **OK** to view the report.
