title: Summary Level
---


In browsers, each grouping is assigned a level.


{:.example}
If the **Sales 
 Invoices** browser has been grouped by sales representatives, currency  and then by customer, the customer grouping is assigned group level 1,  currency grouping is assigned group level 2 and the sales representatives  grouping is assigned group level 3.


For summarizing data each grouping is assigned a summary level. This  option allows you to specify the level for which you will be defining  the color of the summary box in the following field. The **Grid 
 Footer** option allows you to specify the level for the summary box  that is displayed at the bottom of the browser and at the end of each  grouping.
