<p>You can group records in a browser based on common fields. Grouping  is the process of arranging a set of similar records together. Grouping  the records in a browser enables better presentation and assimilation  of data. The records in the browser are grouped based on the column headers.  The <strong>Group By Box</strong> indicates these  groupings. The first and last columns in a browser cannot be grouped.</p>

<p class="example">The <strong>Items</strong>  browser can be grouped based on categories and then on the sales measure.</p>
