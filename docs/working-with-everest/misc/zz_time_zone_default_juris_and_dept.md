Select the time zone you are currently in. If this field is left blank  it defaults to the system 'Time Zone'.


This data is useful when scheduling tasks for users located in different  time zones. This change affects your Contact Manager. It does not affect  your Time Clock schedules since the **Everest**  Time Clock module uses the time from the client workstationâ€™s operating  system settings and not the **Everest**  settings.
