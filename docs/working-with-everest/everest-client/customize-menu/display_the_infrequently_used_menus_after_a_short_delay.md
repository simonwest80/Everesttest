# Display Infrequently Used Menus After a Short Delay


Additionally, you can customize the display of submenus, such that the  infrequently used commands are seen a short time after the regularly used  options are displayed. They can also be displayed by clicking on the down  arrow ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_drop_down_button.gif) of the drop-down list.


{:.steps}
To display infrequently used menus after  a short delay, do the following:

- Ensure that  the **Enhanced** or **Flat** option has been selected as the **Bar 
 Style** in the **Workstation Settings** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab).
- Right click  on any toolbar and select **Customize**.  You will see the [Customize]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/misc/customize_dialog_box.html) dialog  box.
- From the **Options** tab, select the **Show 
 full menus after a short delay** check box. This option is visible  only if enable or flat option is selected.
