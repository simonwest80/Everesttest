# Group Related Options and Menus


Related options can be grouped in the main menu bar and toolbars. When  you group options, a separator bar appears between the groups. This option  enables you to organize the available commands better.

You can group the menus **Time 
 Clock** and **Payroll** together.

To group related options, do the following:

- Click the icon  on any of the toolbars or the main menu bar and select **Add 
 or Remove Buttons**. You will see a drop-down menu listing all menus.
- Select **Customize**. You will see the **Customize** dialog box.
- Right-click  on the required menu or option in the main menu bar or toolbar and select  **Begin a group**.
