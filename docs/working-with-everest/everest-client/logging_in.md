# Logging In


**There are three ways to log in to Everest:**

- Double-click  on the **Everest** icon ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_eae_logo.gif) on your desktop.
- From the **Windows Start** menu select **Programs 
 &gt; Everest Advanced Edition &gt; Everest**.
- Double-click  on the **Everest.exe** file. This  file will be present in the directory specified at the time of installing  the **Everest** client.



When you click on the **Everest.exe** you  will see the [**Everest 
 login**]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/the_everest_login_dialog_box.html) dialog box.


**Logging in to your company is a two-step procedure:**

- You must [log in to the company database]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/logging-in/login_company_database.html) and  specify the [user details]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/logging-in/login_user.html).
- You then specify  the [jurisdiction]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/logging-in/jurisdiction.html) and [location/sub-location]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/logging-in/login_department.html).  The jurisdiction logged into determines the amount of sales tax to be  charged. Revenue and expenses will be accounted for in the logged-in location/sub-location.  All sales and purchase documents are created for the logged-in location/sub-location.  The location/sub-location specified also determines which logo will be  printed on documents.
