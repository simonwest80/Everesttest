If you login as supervisor, you will have  complete access rights. By default, the supervisor is created as a user  of every company that is created. The user code of the previous logged-in  user is displayed in this field, by default.


**Password**

When logging into the Sample Company, the  supervisor’s default password, ‘super’ is displayed (as asterisks) in  this field, by default.

It is recommended that you change this password, after  initial login, for security purposes.
