<p>If your company implements the <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong> integrated option, your <strong>Everest</strong>  desktop may be replaced by the <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong>. The <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong> adds an advanced business intelligence feature  to your desktop. You may also be provided with a link to a web site where  you can access this information remotely.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence technologies allow in-depth analysis of your company’s  data and transactions after they occur for better decision-making. Your  System Administrator, or other authorized user, uses the <strong>Everest</strong>  data warehouse Setup to create a data warehouse from your <strong>Everest</strong>  database. This data warehouse contains important data collected from your  business through <strong>Everest</strong>.  Selected  information is provided to you, based on business requirements, and is  displayed in chart or graphic format on your <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong>. These blocks of information provided to you  are called <strong>Web Parts</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>  uses the power of <strong>Everest’s</strong> data  integration to provide you with necessary information used for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Searching and reporting</li>
  <li>Performance metrics</li>
  <li>Monitoring key  performance indicators for improvements</li>
  <li>Advanced analysis  and more informed decision-making</li>
  <li>Understanding your  customers’ needs</li>
  <li>Increasing customer  satisfaction</li>
  <li>Prospecting new  customers</li>
  <li>Gaining a competitive  advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>  gives you the ability to see mission critical information that is relevant  to you.</p>
