# Everest Advanced Dashboard


If your company implements the **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard** integrated option, your **Everest**  desktop may be replaced by the **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard**. The **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard** adds an advanced business intelligence feature  to your desktop. You may also be provided with a link to a web site where  you can access this information remotely.


Business Intelligence technologies allow in-depth analysis of your company’s  data and transactions after they occur for better decision-making. Your  System Administrator, or other authorized user, uses the **Everest**  data warehouse Setup to create a data warehouse from your **Everest**  database. This data warehouse contains important data collected from your  business through **Everest**.  Selected  information is provided to you, based on business requirements, and is  displayed in chart or graphic format on your **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard**. These blocks of information provided to you  are called **Web Parts**.


The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  uses the power of **Everest’s** data  integration to provide you with necessary information used for:

- Searching and reporting
- Performance metrics
- Monitoring key  performance indicators for improvements
- Advanced analysis  and more informed decision-making
- Understanding your  customers’ needs
- Increasing customer  satisfaction
- Prospecting new  customers
- Gaining a competitive  advantage



The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  gives you the ability to see mission critical information that is relevant  to you.


The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  can include graphs, reports, performance indicators, and reminders on  the dashboard depending upon how it has been configured.
