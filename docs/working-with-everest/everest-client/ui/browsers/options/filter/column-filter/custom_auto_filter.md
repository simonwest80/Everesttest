# Custom Auto Filter


To filter the list by two values in the same column or to apply comparison  operators such as equals, greater than, or lesser than, click the arrow  in the column header and then click **Custom**.  You will see the **Custom AutoFilter**  dialog box. Select the operators in the boxes on the left, and specify  the values in the boxes on the right to select comparison operators and  values.


{:.note}
When you apply a filter to a column, the records  that meet the filter condition are displayed in the browser. These records  can be further filtered based on any other column.


You can apply up to two conditions to a column.


**Displaying records that meet more than one criterion:**

- From the **Custom AutoFilter**dialog box:
- To match one  criterion, click the comparison operator you want to use in the first  box under **Show rows where** and  then enter the value you want to match in the box immediately to the right  of the comparison operator.
- To display  rows that meet two conditions, enter the comparison operator and value  you want, and then click the **And** button.  In the second comparison operator and value boxes, enter the operator  and value you want.
- To display  rows that meet either one condition or another, enter the comparison operator  and value you want, and then click the **Or** button. In the second comparison operator and value boxes, enter  the operator and value you want.
