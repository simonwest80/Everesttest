# Chart Setup - By Group


This tab allows you to specify the parameters for a 3D chart. A 3D graph  or chart has an added third dimension called the Z-axis  using which the user can view graphs that are three-dimensional and based  on group totals.


{:.example}
A graph of yearly sales by sales rep. shows  the value of sales in the Y-axis,  the years in the X-axis and sales for each sales rep. for the year in  the Z-axis.


**Title**
: Enter the title of the graph in this field. By default  the name of the browser is displayed in this field.


**Y-axis**
: Specify whether the Y-axis  should display the value of the records or the number of records in the  selected criteria. If **Value** is  selected, choose a numeric field for the field in the Y-axis  column. If **Record Count** is selected,  you cannot select a field for the Y-axis  since the number of records for the criteria specified in the X- and Z-axis  is displayed here.


{:.example}
Say you want to find out the number of sales  invoices created by each sales representative in the fiscal year 2001.  Select **record count** in the **Y-axis**. Enter the title for Y-axis in  **Enter title for Y-axis** field.  Select 'Year' as the field in the **X-axis 
 column** and 'Rep.' as the field in the **Z-axis****column**. Click **OK** to view the report.
