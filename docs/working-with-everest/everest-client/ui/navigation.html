<p><strong>Everest</strong> uses the Windows Graphical User Interface to provide users with the look and feel of a standard Windows application. Records can be selected with a mouse or keyboard. Windows can be resized or moved. In many areas, context-sensitive menus are available through the use of right mouse button.</p>

<p>This help file assumes that users of <strong>Everest</strong> are already familiar with the standard Windows interface, and therefore only unusual or context-specific navigational instructions are included in this Online Help.</p>
