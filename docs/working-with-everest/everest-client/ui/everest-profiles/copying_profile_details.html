<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides you the facility  to create a new profile based on the details in an existing one. The details  of one profile can be copied into the new profile and modified as required.  This feature is useful when you have to create a number of records that  are very similar to an existing one.</p>

<p>Copying profile details also reduces the time taken for data entry and  the possibility of errors.</p>

<p class="steps">To copy the details from a profile, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the  <img src="/versata-everest-docs/working-with-everest/img/wwe_standard_browser_options_new.gif" alt="" /> icon <strong>&gt; In New Window/In 
 Current Window</strong> from the appropriate browser. You will see a profile  with no details.</li>
  <li>From the first  field of the profile, which is the unique code that identifies the profile,  select the record to be copied. The details of the record will be displayed.  Ensure that you change the code before saving the details.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you want to create a new item based on  an existing item with item code ‘CRADLE’, select the existing code in  the new item profile. Notice that the details relating to the selected  item are displayed in the profile. Change the required details and save  the item.</p>

<p class="note">The procedure to copy existing document details  into a new one is different. Details of a document can be copied by selecting  <strong>Options &gt; Retrieve &gt; Copy of</strong>  from the document profile.</p>
