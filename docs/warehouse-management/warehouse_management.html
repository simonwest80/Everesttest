<p>Warehouse management is a critical function in organizations where inventories are a significant current asset. Companies involved in manufacture or distribution of products incur substantial expenditure towards materials. Such companies require effective control over procurement, storage and utilization of materials. While purchasing function is involved with the procurement of material supplies, warehouse management is concerned with the management and control of materials in stock.</p>
