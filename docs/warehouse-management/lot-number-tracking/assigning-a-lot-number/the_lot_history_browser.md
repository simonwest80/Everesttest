# Â The  Lot History Browser


The **Lot History** browser shows  the changes in the lot from the time it was initially inventoried. Each  document that pertains to that lot is listed by the creation sequence.  You can easily view purchases, sales, and inventory adjustments made to  the selected lot along with the applicable unit of measure. Document transactions  for a lot that appear in the browser include:

- Purchase Receipts
- Sales Invoices
- Credit Memos
- Debit Memos
- Quantity Adjustments
- Work Orders



Information for each document includes both the document unit of measure  and the stock unit of measure making it easier to compare and reconcile  this information with your actual records.


{:.note}
The item must be lot tracked for the details  to display. If an item is not lot tracked for a particular period of time,  the documents created for that lot during this time period will not appear  in the **Lot History** browser. However,  lot details will be available in the **Lot 
 History** browser if the same lot is used even after you clear the  **Use Lot Tracking** option on the  **Inventory** tab of the **Item**  Profile.

You can select Lot 24 in the **Lots**  browser and open the lot history. Documents that affect the lot are displayed  in the browser and can be opened for viewing.
