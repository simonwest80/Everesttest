# Quantity Expression


Quantity is expressed in terms of the purchase measure. When an item  is added to the document, the **Quantity**  column displays a default quantity of measure (1).


The quantity entered in this field depends on the quantity entry method  specified for the measure in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt;** From the **Items** browser,  double-click the required record > **Item**  profile > **Purchases** tab).
