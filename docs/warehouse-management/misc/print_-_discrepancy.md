# Print - Discrepancy


When the system count does not match the physical count, you can generate  a report to display this discrepancy. You can generate this report before  the Stock Count document is reconciled. Selecting the **Print**  > **Discrepancy** option brings  up the **Stock Discrepancy Printing Preferences**  dialog box. Specify the parameters based on which the discrepancy report  should be generated.
