# Document Information


Loc/Sub-Loc


By assigning a location/sub-location to the document, you can keep track  of inventory adjustments by sub-location and print reports for management  information purposes.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  can group all inventory adjustments in the **Inventory adjustment** browser by location/sub-location to find out  the total adjustments initiated by the **Distribution 
 Location/Sub-Location**.

Document #


When you save a document, the system automatically generates the document  number. The document number is the next number in sequence for inventory  adjustment documents for the login  location or sub-location.


If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or sub-location, then the document uses the sequence number assigned  to the default location (path: **File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt;Default Location**  field).

![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If 1256  is the next number in sequence for inventory adjustments for the login  location/sub-location ‘Mail Order’,  then 1256 is assigned to a new inventory adjustment document created for  the location/sub-location ‘Mail Order’.


Inventory adjustment document numbers are prefixed with **IA**  to denote that the document is an inventory adjustment. The same series  of numbers is used for all adjustment types.


Notes


Notes can be attached to a document to keep track of important messages  or information pertaining to that document


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You can  attach a note detailing the reason for the inventory adjustment being  made.


The document note is used primarily for communication between users  within the company.


Document Date


The date of an inventory adjustment document is the date of creation  of that document. The document date, by default, is your login  date. You cannot change the date on the document. To create documents  for a different date, you must login  with a different date.
