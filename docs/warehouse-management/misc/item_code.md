# Item Code


Specifying an Item Code helps you find the serial numbers attached to  that item.


The drop-down button beside the **Item 
 Code** field allows you to view the history of search parameters  specified earlier.


When you click the browse button, the **Items**  browser is displayed, from where you can select a single item or multiple  items for your search. The Item Codes you select from the **Items**  browser are displayed along with their names in the **Selection**  dialog box. If you select multiple items, the word ‘Multiple’ is displayed  in the field in the form of a URL link by default.
