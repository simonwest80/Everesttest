# Retrieving Discontinued Item(s)  into Stock Transfer Documents


**Everest** allows you to retrieve  discontinued item(s)  in to the stock transfer documents. In such cases you need not reactivate  the item for retrieval; you can directly call those items into the document.

- Select the  discontinued item that you want to retrieve and click **OK**.  You will be prompted whether you want to retrieve the item. Click **OK** and proceed.

In case you are retrieving multiple items of which some  are discontinued, you will be prompted whether to retrieve only active  items or both active and discontinued items. Select according to your  requirement; click **Yes**, and proceed.


This is applicable also in case you are retrieving a  kit having any component item(s)  with the status ‘discontinued’.
