<p>Information contained in the <strong>Details</strong>  tab of the inventory adjustment documents are listed below:</p>

<p>Created By</p>

<p>This is the user code of the person who creates the document. By default,  this field displays the user code of the logged in user.</p>

<p>Loc/Sub-Loc</p>

<p>The document’s location/sub-location identifies the location or sub-location  for which the document is being created. It is the location or sub-location  that initiates the inventory adjustment. When a new inventory adjustment  document is created, the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong>  field displays the login  location/sub-location, but a different location or sub-location can be  selected for the document.</p>

<p>Total</p>

<p>The total value of all the adjustment amounts in an inventory adjustment  document is displayed in this field. You cannot edit this field.</p>
