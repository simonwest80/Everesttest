<h1 id="process---retrieve-items">Process - Retrieve Items</h1>

<p>To begin the process of counting stock, you need to draw items into  the <strong>Stock Count</strong> profile. You can  do this by using the <strong>Retrieve Items</strong>  option. The <strong>Retrieve Items</strong> option  provides three ways of retrieving items for which you want to count the  stock.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>All</strong>  – Choose this option to bring all the items i.e. the number of items multiplied  by the number of bins selected into the <strong>Item 
 Details</strong> grid of the <strong>Stock Count</strong>  profile. For instance, if you have 2 items and 3 stock bins, you will  see 2*3=6 records in the <strong>Item Details</strong>  grid irrespective of the stock availability in the bins.</li>
  <li><strong>Find 
 Items</strong> – Choose this option to filter items based on specific parameters  in the <strong>Find Items</strong> dialog box.</li>
</ul>

    <tr>

      <td><a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/finding-items/find_items.html">Find  Items</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Import</strong>  – You may have identified a list of items for which you want to conduct  a stock count. Using the <strong>Import</strong>  option, you can import these items into the <strong>Stock 
 Count</strong> profile. It is imperative that you save the <strong>Stock 
 Count</strong> profile prior to importing items into it. If the <strong>Stock 
 Count</strong> profile already contains items and you import more items  into it, only those items or item-bin-lot combinations which are not present  in the document are imported. In other words, items are not duplicated  during the import process.</li>
</ul>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/lens.gif" alt="" /></td>
      <td><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/misc/data_import_wizard_error_dialog_box.html">Data  Import Wizard</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If the <strong>Stock Count</strong> profile already  contains items and you import more items into it, only those items or  item-bin combinations which are not present in the document are imported.  In other words, items are not duplicated during the import process.</p>

<p class="hint">You can also manually enter items into the  <strong>Stock Count</strong> profile. To do this,  double-click in the <strong>Item Code</strong>  column of the Item Details Grid, and select the item from the drop-down  browser.</p>
