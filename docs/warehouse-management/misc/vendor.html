<p>Specifying a vendor name helps you find serial numbers of items purchased  from a specific vendor. This is useful when you want to track serialized  items purchased from a particular vendor.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  you receive a sub-standard batch of items from a vendor and want to return  all the items in the batch to the vendor, you can search for the serial  numbers by this parameter.</p>

<p>The resulting <strong>Items</strong> browser  shows you all serialized items purchased from the vendor. You can further  narrow down your search by combining the ‘vendor’ parameter with the ‘lot  number’ parameter  to identify the specific lot of the serialized items that have to be returned.</p>

<p>The drop-down button beside the <strong>Vendor</strong>  field allows you to view the history of search parameters specified earlier.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to select  vendors to be included in the search. You will see the <strong>Addresses</strong>  browser from where you can select individual or multiple vendors.</p>

<p>When you select the vendor, the code and name of the vendor appear in  the <strong>Selection</strong> dialog box. If you  select multiple vendors, the word ‘Multiple’ is displayed in the field  in the form of a URL link by default.</p>
