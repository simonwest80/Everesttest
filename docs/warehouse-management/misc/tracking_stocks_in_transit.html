<p>Stock-in-transit are stocks that are being moved from one  stock area to the other. To track a stock-in-transit, create a stock transfer  document to transfer stocks to an <strong>In 
 Transit</strong> stock area when the items are shipped. When the items are  received at the destination, transfer the items from the <strong>In 
 Transit</strong> stock area to the destination stock area.</p>

<p>A company that has to transfer stock across locations can  track stock that is In transit through the stock transfer profile (Select  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New 
 Request</strong> &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>  from the Stock Transfer profile).</p>
