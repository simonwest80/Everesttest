<h1 id="methods-of-counting">Methods of Counting</h1>

<p>You are provided with two stock-count methods, both of which indicate  the beginning of the count process:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Block 
 for Counting</strong> - This method allows you to block all transactions  pertaining to the item being counted from the selected bin during the  counting process. The item can be received, committed or shipped only  after the process of counting is complete.</li>
  <li><strong>Take 
 Snapshot to Count</strong> - When you use this stock-count method, you can  continue to use the item from the selected bin in transactions till you  mark the Stock Count document as Counted. Transactions are not allowed  between the Counted and Completed statuses.</li>
</ul>
