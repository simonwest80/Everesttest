  <dd>This column displays the stock measure for the item.  You cannot modify the unit of measure.</dd>
  <dt><strong>From Invt Acnt</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field displays the Inventory Control Account  from where the stock is selected.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">The Inventory Control Account defined in the  Posting Group assigned to the line item is considered first. If no Inventory  Control Account is defined for the item, the control account defined for  the category to which the line item belongs is used. If the Inventory  Control Account is not defined for either the item or the category, the  Inventory Control Account of the stock area’s location from where the  item is transferred is taken into consideration.</p>

<p>If the line item in a stock transfer document  is transferred from several stock areas pertaining to different locations  with different inventory control accounts the <strong>From 
 Invt Acnt</strong> column for this line item will be blank unless the user  overrides it.</p>

<p>The user may override the Inventory control  account by selecting one control account in the From Inventory account  column before the document is saved. However, there will be multiple rows  for such line item with multiple inventory control accounts in the journal.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Cost</strong></dt>
  <dd>In the case of non-serialized items, this field  displays the average cost of the item. In the case of serialized items,  it displays the weighted average of the actual cost of the serial numbers  transferred. Average cost is the average cost of the item in the stock  unit of measure.</dd>
  <dt><strong>To Bin</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the stock bin to which you want to transfer  the items.</dd>
  <dt><strong>To Invt Acnt</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Inventory Control Account defined in the Posting  Group assigned to the line item is considered first. If no Inventory Control  Account is defined for the item, the control account defined for the category  to which the line item belongs is used. If the Inventory Control Account  is not defined for either the item or the category, the Inventory Control  Account of the stock area’s location to where the item is transferred  is taken into consideration.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">If a Posting Group with an Inventory control  account has been assigned to either the <strong>Item</strong>  profile or <strong>Category</strong> profile the  <strong>From Invt Acnt</strong> and the <strong>To 
 Invt Acnt</strong> inventory control accounts will be similar.</p>

<p>Irrespective of how the inventory control  account has been resolved, you can edit the <strong>From 
 Invt Acnt</strong> or the <strong>To Invt Acnt</strong>  inventory control accounts to any other account of the type Inventory  Control Account. However, a message appears warning the user of the possible  mismatch between the financial and inventory reports.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Quantity</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the quantity of items to be transferred. This  column displays the total quantity of the items available for transfer  from a particular stock bin.
