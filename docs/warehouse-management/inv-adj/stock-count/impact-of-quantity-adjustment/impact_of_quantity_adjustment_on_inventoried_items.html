<h1 id="impact-of-quantity-adjustment-on-inventoried-items">Impact of Quantity Adjustment on Inventoried Items</h1>

<p>In the absence of any distinguishing features as numbers, transfer of  inventoried items poses a major hurdle. It is virtually impossible to  identify the source of items that show up as excess in a bin. Also, it  is very difficult to ascertain the new location of items that are short  in a bin. This problem can be overcome by doing a quantity adjustment,  which automatically adjusts the system stock to the physical stock. The  impact of this adjustment can be summarized as below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Items are added  or written off at the average cost.</li>
  <li>Quantity adjustment  for the variance quantity for an item in one Stock Count document offsets  the variance quantity for the same item in other Stock Count documents.</li>
  <li>The net variance  for an item in all the count sheets amounts to the quantity that is actually  added or written off.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Item 101 FG Tips is stocked in six bins. Counting  in bins 1, 2, and 3 is completed first; thereafter, the item is counted  in bins 4, 5, and 6. The system count puts the stock of 101 FG Tips at  60; however, the physical count places it at 59.</p>

<p>A quantity adjustment is done to reconcile the system stock to the physical  stock. The net variance of 1 item in both the count sheets is zeroed out  by writing off one quantity.</p>
