<p>Counting stock accurately is the foundation of a good business. Although  <strong>Everest</strong> records the purchase and  sale of every item during every transaction and automatically updates  your inventory, it does not account for losses due to plain error, pilferage,  shoplifting, or general damages. Errors of the kind, if undetected, could  distort your financial figures at the year-end accounting procedures.  Accuracy in stock count is therefore vital to protecting your business.  Manual counting, though tedious, is inevitable. To ease the process of  physical counting of stock, you can use the Stock Count document. This  feature helps you compare the stock as stated by the system with the actual  physical count and print the reports of variance. It also allows you to  correct the discrepancy by creating inventory adjustment documents.</p>
