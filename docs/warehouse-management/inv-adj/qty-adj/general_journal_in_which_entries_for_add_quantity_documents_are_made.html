<p>Accounting entries are created in a General Journal with the description  ‘Quantity Adjustment’.  These general journals cannot be modified or voided.</p>

<p>Entries are made in an open Inventory Adjustments journal that fulfils  the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The login  date corresponds with the accounting period of the journal.</li>
  <li>A journal’s  group is same as the journal group selected in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> of the user creating the inventory adjustment document.</li>
  <li>A journal’s  location/sub-location is same as the login  location/sub-location of the user creating the quantity adjustment document.</li>
  <li>A system journal  has the description ‘Quantity Adjustment’.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such open journal exists, a new general journal is created. The  general journal number for the new journal is taken from the sequence  number for general journals for the login  location or the sub-location’s parent location.</p>

<p>If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or sub-location, then the document uses the sequence number assigned  to the default location. The default location is specified in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Default Location</strong>  field).</p>
