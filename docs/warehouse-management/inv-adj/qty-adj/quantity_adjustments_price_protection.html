<h1 id="quantity-adjustments">Quantity Adjustments</h1>

<p>Quantity adjustments may be required, if the physical stock of an item  differs from the stocks as per <strong>Everest</strong>.  If the physical stock is more, the additional quantity has to be added  to the stock; if less, it has to be reduced from the stock. The item may  be serialized, auto-serialized or non-serialized. Quantity Adjustments  are of two types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add 
 Quantity</strong> - If the physical stock of an item exceeds the stock as  per <strong>Everest</strong>, the excess quantity  in the physical stock has to be brought into <strong>Everest</strong>  by adding the quantity to the stock.</li>
  <li><strong>Write 
 off Quantity</strong> - Physical stocks may have to be written off for reasons  such as obsolescence, breakage, spoilage, expiry  or loss.</li>
</ul>
