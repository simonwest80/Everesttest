<p>Serialized and Auto-serialized Items</p>

<p>If the item specified is serialized or auto-serialized, you must attach  the serial numbers to be transferred by selecting <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Attach Serial #</strong> available  in the <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> profile.</p>

<p>The <strong>Retrieve Serial Numbers</strong> dialog  box is displayed wherein you can attach specific serial numbers from your  inventory to the document.</p>

<p>Non-serialized Items</p>

<p>If the item specified is non-serialized, the quantity to be adjusted  can be specified using <strong>Attach</strong><strong>Quantity</strong> dialog box. When you  try to enter the quantity in the <strong>Quantity</strong>  column, this dialog box displays the stock available in various stock  areas. Enter the quantity from the required stock area and click <strong>OK</strong>. The specified quantity will be displayed  in the <strong>Quantity</strong> column. This quantity  cannot exceed the total quantity available.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>The amount is the total sum for the items to be  transferred.</dd>
  <dd>The value of the stock transfer in case of non-serialized  items is the average cost multiplied by the quantity transferred.</dd>
  <dd>The value of stock transfer in case of serialized  and auto-serialized items is the sum of the actual cost of the serialized  items.</dd>

<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">The calculation depends on the 
 quantity entry method for the item.</font>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the quantity of an item is measured in kilograms, 2 kilograms and 500  grams of the item, at a cost of $2000, would be expressed as 2:500 under  the fractional method.</p>

<p>The value of the quantity would be calculated  as follows:</p>

<p><strong>2 * $2000 + (500/1000) * $2000</strong></p>

<p>If the quantity is 2 kilograms, 500 grams  and 15 milligrams, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed  as 2500.15.</p>

<p>The value of the quantity would be calculated  as follows:</p>

<p><strong>(2500/1000) * $2000+(0.15/1000) * $2000</strong></p>
