# Stock Transfer from Sales and Purchase Documents


Purchase and sales documents in **Everest** serve a dual purpose. They are not only used to record the steps  in the purchase or sales cycles but also used for managing inventory movements.


**![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) When  you take items into stock, you can record their acquisition in a purchase  receipt.**


The items received from a vendor for approval can be committed or attached  to a purchase order without affecting inventory value. The movement of  items that are reserved for shipment against a sales order to a packing  area can be recorded against that sales order. When the items are shipped,  the items are moved out from the current stock area through a sales invoice.


Advantages of using sales and purchase documents to record inventory  movements are:

- **No 
 discrepancy between Financial Ledger and Stock Ledger** - A Stock  Ledger is an account of the item quantities while a Financial Ledger is  a record of the item value. Many accounting systems first record the entry  of items in the Stock Ledger through a Goods Received Note. The purchases  are accounted later when the vendor's bill is received. The time lag between  the receipt of items and the accounting results in discrepancy between  the value of stocks as per the Stock Ledger and value of stocks entered  in the Financial Ledger. **Everest**  ensures that item receipts are simultaneously taken into stock and accounted  for.
- **No 
 duplication of information** - When items are requisitioned from  stocks, the reason for their movement has to be recorded.

When sales and purchase documents are used to record stock movements,  this information need not be duplicated.

- **Easy 
 retrieval of information** - **Everest**  integrates inventory management with other business processes. This makes  for easy retrieval of information from a single source.
