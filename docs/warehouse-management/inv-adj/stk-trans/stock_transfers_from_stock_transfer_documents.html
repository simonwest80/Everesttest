<p>Stock area transfer normally takes place to correct demand and supply  imbalances within the company.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> An  item that is slow moving in a certain distribution center may be moved  to an area where it is in demand.</p>

<p>Stock area transfers may also be required to segregate old or damaged  stock, stocks to be exchanged or repaired and stocks nearing obsolescence  from the other stocks.</p>
