<p>Cost adjustments to inventory may be done to increase or decrease the  value of an item in stock. The item may be serialized, auto-serialized  or non-serialized. If it is a serialized item, adjustments are made to  the cost of each item. If it is a non-serialized item, adjustments are  made to the average cost of the item.</p>

<p>Adjustments to inventory costs and value may be required for maintaining  sales margins where an item’s selling price is calculated as a markup  on its cost. When the purchase cost of the item falls, you may adjust  the cost of the item to ensure that selling prices are maintained at earlier  levels.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> You  sell item 10256 at a 25% markup on cost. The item cost is usually $100  but on one consignment it drops to $80. In this case, to maintain prices  at $125 you must adjust the cost by $20.</p>

<p>Adjustments to inventory costs may also be required to restate inventory  values at current market rates.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  there is a sudden drop in price of an item, then you may have to write  down the value of the item in stock.</p>

<p>If you select the <strong>Allow Users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in location</strong> check box (path:  <strong>File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General</strong> tab), you can  only select items from the stock areas belonging to the logged in location.</p>
