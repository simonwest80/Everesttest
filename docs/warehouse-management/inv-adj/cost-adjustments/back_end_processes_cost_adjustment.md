# Back End Processes


Following are the back end processes that take place, when you make a cost adjustment:


The inventory value of the item increases, if the cost adjustment is positive and reduces, if the cost adjustment is negative.


The average cost of the item changes. The new average cost is calculated by dividing the new inventory value by the quantity in stock.


If the item is serialized, the cost of the serial numbers attached to the document is updated with the new cost.
