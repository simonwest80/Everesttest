  <dd>The accounts affected are Inventory Adjustment account  and Inventory Control account. The Inventory Adjustment Account defined  in the Posting Group assigned to the line item is considered first. If  no Inventory Adjustment Account is defined for the item, the control account  defined for the category to which the line item belongs is used. If the  Inventory Adjustment Account is not defined for either the item or the  category, the Inventory Adjustment Account of the document’s location  is taken into consideration.  You  may select another account if required. Inventory Adjustment accounts  must be an expense type of account.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Inventory Adjustment Amount</strong></dt>
  <dd>The amount of inventory adjustment for the line  item is calculated and displayed. Accounting entries are made for this  value.</dd>
  <dd>The amount of inventory adjustment is calculated  using these formulae:</dd>
</dl>

<p>Serialized/Auto-serialized Items</p>

<p>Adjustment amount = (Cost per measure * Quantity for adjustment) - (Sum  of actual cost of serial numbers attached)</p>

<p>If the adjustment amount is negative, the inventory value reduces; if  positive, inventory value increases.</p>

<p>Non-serialized Items</p>

<p>Adjustment amount = (Cost per measure * Quantity for adjustment) - (Quantity  for adjustment * Previous cost per measure)</p>

<p>The computation of amounts depends on the quantity entry method.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/warehouse-management/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the quantity of an item is measured in kilograms, 2 kilograms and 500  grams of the item, at a cost of $2000, would be expressed as 2:500 under  the fractional method. The amount would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>2 * $2000 + (500/1000)  * $2000</p>

<p>If the quantity is 2 kilograms, 500 grams  and 15 milligrams, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed  as 2500.15. The amount would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>(2500/1000) * $2000+(0.15/1000) * $2000</p>
