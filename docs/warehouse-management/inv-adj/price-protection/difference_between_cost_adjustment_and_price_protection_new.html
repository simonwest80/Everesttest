<h1 id="difference-between-cost-adjustment-and-price-protection">Difference between Cost Adjustment and Price Protection</h1>

<p>Cost adjustments are made to adjust inventory costs for reasons such  as change in market price, or to write down values of old stock. Price  protection adjustments are made either to credit a vendor for cost increase  on items in stock or debit a vendor for cost reduction of items in stock.</p>

<p>Cost adjustments result in a change only in inventory value. Price protection  not only changes inventory value but also affects the Accounts Payable  and vendor balance.</p>

<p>Cost adjustments create accounting entries in a General Journal. Price  protection creates accounting entries only in the Purchase Journal.</p>
