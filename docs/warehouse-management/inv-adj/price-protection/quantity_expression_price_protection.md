# Quantity Expression


Quantity is expressed in terms of the purchase measure. When an item  is added to the document, the column displays a default quantity of measure  (1).


The quantity entered in this field depends on the quantity entry method  specified for the measure in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Purchase** tab).

If the quantity is 2 kilograms, 500 grams  and 15 milligrams, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed  as 2500.15 gram.
