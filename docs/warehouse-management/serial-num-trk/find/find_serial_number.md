# Find Serial Number


Serial number filters are used to search for serialized/auto-serialized  items and items with manufacturersâ€™ serial numbers attached to them. The  serial number filter is an extension to the Find Items filter and facilitates  search for serial numbers of items.


The **Find Serial Number** option  is useful in the following ways:

- Finding serial  numbers of items, which have an expiry  date to ensure that the expired items are not used in sales documents.  This is particularly useful in the pharmaceutical industry and grocery  stores.
- Printing bar  codes for serialized items, by using the serial number of the item in  the bar code.
- When a lot  of serialized items is damaged, you can use the lot number to find serial  numbers of the damaged items and discontinue those items from use in document.
- Locating the  stock areas where the serialized items have been stored, to enable speedy  inspection and delivery to customers.



The **Find Serial Number** option  yields the data in the same format as the **Serial 
 Numbers** browser does.
