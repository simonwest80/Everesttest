# Cost of Inventoried Items


The cost of assembly components used in production is computed differently  for serialized and non-serialized inventory.


**Serialized Items**
: The actual cost for serialized item is the weighted  average cost of the serial numbers attached to the document.

**Non-serialized Items**
: The actual cost for non-serialized items is the  weighted average cost of the item at the time of assigning quantities  for production.
