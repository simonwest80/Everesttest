<p>Normal loss is the quantity of the item that is generally lost during  the assembly process.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  require 100 units of an item. If there is usually a loss of 9% on the  original input, you would have to use 110 units of the input item. The  loss of 10 units during production is called normal loss.</strong></p>

<p>The standard input and normal loss for the assembly is defined in the  Bill Of Material in the <strong>Item</strong> (Assembly)  profile (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt;  <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Assembly</strong>  &gt; <strong>Input</strong> tab).</p>

<p>The actual input entered in the work order must also account for the  normal loss.</p>

<p>The cost of normal loss is built into the cost of production.</p>
