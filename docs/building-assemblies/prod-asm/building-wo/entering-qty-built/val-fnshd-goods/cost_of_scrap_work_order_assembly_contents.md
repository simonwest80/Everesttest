# Valuation of Scrap


The rate for scrap is defined in the **Item**  (Assembly) profile (path: **Inventory**  > **Items** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Assembly**  > **Scrap** tab).


You can edit the rate for scrap from the [**Build** dialog box]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/building-wo/entering-qty-built/the_build_profile.html).


The value of scrap is deducted from the actual cost of production to  arrive at the total value of the finished goods.
