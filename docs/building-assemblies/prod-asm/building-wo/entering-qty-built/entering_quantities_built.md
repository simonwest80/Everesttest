# Entering Quantities Built


The last step in creating an assembly item is to build it. Invoke the  **Build** process (path: **Work 
 Order** profile > **Options**  > **Process** > **Build**)  when the work order is completed and you want to record the items built.


Before you set the status to 'Build' make sure you enter the quantities/amounts  of expenses/overheads as represented through non-inventoried items.


{:.note}
- Once you select  the **Build** option you cannot modify  the work order. Therefore all the quantities that are built should be  entered at this stage.
- <font color="#000000" class="hcp6">If the actual output (sum of the normal and defective 
 output) is less than the <span class="hcp1">Required Output</span>, 
 and you have linked serial/lot numbers of the input items to the assembled 
 item, the serial numbers that are generated during the linking process 
 remain in the &quot;Out&quot; stock area.</font> ****


{:.steps}
To enter  the built quantity (of the assembly item), do the following:

- From the work  order with status ‘In Process’,  select **Options** > **Process**  > **Build**. You will see the [**Build** dialog box]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/building-wo/entering-qty-built/the_build_profile.html) profile.



{:.note}
If the assembly item is inventoried-serialized or inventoried auto-serialized,  the A**ssembly Link Serial No**. dialog  box is displayed. Link the serial #/Lot # of input items to each of the  assembly serialized item, and then click **OK**.  The **Build** dialog box is displayed.

- Once you specify  the required information, click **OK**.  The **Build** dialog box will be saved.  You will see the [**Assign Quantity For** dialog box]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/building-wo/entering-qty-built/trans-fnshd-goods/assign_quantity_profile.html).
