<p>The accounting entries for assembled items, defectives and scrap are  recorded in an <strong>open</strong> general journal  that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>It should have  the same journal group as the one selected in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Workstation</strong> <strong>Settings 
 &gt; Company Settings</strong> tab) of the user building the work order.</li>
  <li>It should have  the same location as the logged in location or sub-location of the user  building the work order.</li>
  <li>It should have  the description “Work order completed”.</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such <strong>open</strong> journal exists,  a new general journal is created. The number for the new journal is taken  from the sequence number specified for general journals in the logged  in location or sub-location.</p>
