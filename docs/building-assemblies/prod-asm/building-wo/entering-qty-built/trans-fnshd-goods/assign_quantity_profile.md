# The Assign Quantity Dialog Box


The **Assign Quantity** dialog box  enables you to transfer the assembly item (finished item) to any ‘Stock’  type stock area and attach lot numbers. This dialog box is displayed when  you enter the build details in the **Build** dialog box and click **OK**.

By default, the finished output quantity (that is good) is displayed  in the default stock area for receiving completed assembly items.

The defective output by default, is displayed in the default stock area  for receiving defective assembly items.

You can assign the finished output and defective stock to any area other  than the default stock area, if you have adequate security rights.


Lot details are displayed in the **Assign 
 Quantity** dialog box based on whether the assembly item is tracked  for lots.
