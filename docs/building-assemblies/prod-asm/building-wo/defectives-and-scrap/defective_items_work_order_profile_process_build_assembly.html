<p>Defective products or units are those which do not meet quality standards  and are reworked for rectification of defects by application of material,  labor and/or processing and salvaged to the point of either standard products  or sub standard products to be sold as seconds. Defectives may arise due  to the following reasons:</p>

<p class="example">In a garment industry there are items that do not pass the quality test  due to very minor defects, which do not affect the functionality or the  product usability.</p>

<p>Consumer durables  that do not pass the quality test due to a dent or scratch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor workmanship</li>
  <li>Sub-standard  material</li>
  <li>Faulty design  of the product</li>
  <li>Bad supervision</li>
  <li>Careless inspection</li>
</ul>
