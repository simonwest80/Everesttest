<h1 id="cost-of-work-in-process">Cost of Work In Process</h1>

<p>The cost of work-in-process is computed differently for serialized and  non-serialized items.</p>

<p>Serialized Items</p>

<p>The cost of work-in-process for serialized items is the sum of the actual  cost of each serial number attached to the work order.</p>

<p>Non-serialized items</p>

<p>The cost of work in process for non-serialized inventoried items is  computed using the following formula:</p>

<p>Quantity attached to work order * Average Cost of the item at the time  of setting the work order status to In Process.</p>

<p class="note">The cost of non-inventoried items is not included  when calculating the cost of the work-in-process.</p>
