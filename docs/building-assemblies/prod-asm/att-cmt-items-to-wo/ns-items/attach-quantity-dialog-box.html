<p>The <strong>Attach Quantity</strong> dialog box  enables you to commit or reserve non-serialized items to a work order.  This dialog box comprises two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item Information  Section</li>
  <li>Stock Bins  Section</li>
</ul>

<p>Item Information Section</p>

</dl>

<p class="note">If the preference option is set to <strong>Allow

Also changing the view  option from <strong>Specific location</strong>  to <strong>All location</strong> will require the  existing security right.</p>

<p>If you have the rights to change the view and  you  have attached the quantity in <strong>Attach 
 Quantity</strong> dialog box before changing the view from <strong>Specific 
 location</strong> to <strong>All locations</strong>  you will still be able to view the quantity attached.</p>

<p>You have attached the quantity in <strong>Attach 
 Quantity</strong> dialog box before changing the view from <strong>All 
 Locations</strong> to <strong>Specific Location</strong>  or from one specific location to another specific location.  Later  when you change the view a warning message will appear. Click <strong>Yes</strong>  to clear the quantity attached or click <strong>No</strong>  to retain the location.</p>

 Information</strong> section if <strong>All Locations</strong>  option is selected in <strong>View</strong> drop  down field and will be visible as a column in <strong>Stock 
 Bins</strong> section.</p>

<p>Stock Bins Section</p>

<p>This section displays a list of stock bins in which the selected item  is available, the quantities available in each stock bin and the quantities  that are already been attached to the work order.</p>

<p>Only items from stock bins that belong to the logged in location are  available for selection, if the option <strong>Allow 
 users to access only those stock areas in the logged in location</strong> (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other Flow Control</strong>  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab) is selected,  you will need adequate security rights to attach items from stock bins  belonging to any other location.</p>

 Number</strong>, <strong>Lot Expiration</strong>,  <strong>Expired</strong>, <strong>Available 
 Stock</strong>, and <strong>Quantity</strong> <strong>Attached</strong>. All the expired lots will  appear under <strong>Expired</strong> column with  a “Tick Mark” <img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/image1.gif" alt="" />. This will help you to identify the expired  lots. The <strong>Available</strong> quantity is  shown in the measure selected for the item in the document.</p>
