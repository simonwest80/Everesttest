<p>When you attach serial number to the work order, an entry is made in  the history of the serial number. You can view the history of the serial  number attached to or detached from a work order from the <strong>Serial 
 Numbers</strong> browser (path: <strong>Work Order</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt;  <strong>Serial Number History</strong>). The serial  number history provides details of the stock areas and the documents to  which a serial number was assigned.</p>
