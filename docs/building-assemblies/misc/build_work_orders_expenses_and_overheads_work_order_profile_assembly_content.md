# Expenses and Overheads


Expenses and overheads are included in work orders as non-inventoried  items. These are absorbed into the cost of production when the assembled  item is built, by transferring the expenses/overheads to the Inventory  Control account (for finished goods).

In some instances, the amount that you enter for the non-inventoried  items on the work order may be less than its purchase cost. In such a  case, the item's expense account has a debit balance that represents amounts  not absorbed into the production cost.


**![]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  An  item (say freight) is charged to you at $600 on a purchase invoice and  you include this item on a work order with the value $500. When the work  order is built, $500 is transferred to your inventory account. The debit  balance of $100 (for freight) is not absorbed in the cost of production.**


Therefore, you must ensure that the amount charged for production equals  the amount billed by the vendor.


If the overhead/expense item cannot be tracked to a single purchase,  you must ensure that the amounts included in the cost of production are  equal to or less than the total overheads incurred. If not, the value  of the finished goods will be inflated by expenses that have not been  incurred.


**![]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  incur labor charges of $5000 and these are accounted for through more  than one expense account. You create a non-inventoried item for ‘labor  charges’ and add it to the Bill Of Material. Amounts allocated for this  item on work orders should not be more than $5000. If it were greater  than $5000, then the finished goods value would be inflated by the amount  of over-allocation.**
