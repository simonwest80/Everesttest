  <dd><strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to process work orders in parts if you do not want to build  the entire required output during one assembly run.</dd>

You create Work Order  # 10000 to build these 10 computers. When the next work order (work order  # 10020) is created for another 50 computers, work order # 10000 is it’s  main order.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Back Order</strong></dt>
  <dd>If work orders are processed in parts, the work  order that is created based on the current work order is called the Back  Order.</dd>
