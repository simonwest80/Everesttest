<p>Business activity is traditionally classified into manufacturing, retail  sales, wholesale trading, distribution and services. The assembly function  in <strong>Everest</strong> caters to the needs  of organizations whose manufacturing activity involves any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assembling  components to produce finished goods.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Assembly  of hardware components to produce computers with standard configurations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Execution of  job orders based on customer’s specifications for the finished goods.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Made  to order furniture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding value  to raw materials or semi-finished goods to produce finished items.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Cut  and polish raw diamonds to produce cut diamonds.</p>

<p>Although the assembly function addresses the needs of most manufacturing  units, the specialized requirements of the following types of manufacturing  units are beyond the scope of this function:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process industries  that require the output of one process to automatically become the input  of another.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  The  processing of edible oils involves several processes that occur in succession.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manufacturing  that takes place in distinct identifiable and continuous stages where  each stage has separate standards for input, output, joint products, and  by-products.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Manufacture  of sugar involves several stages such as milling and refining. Each stage  results in output of specific joint-products and by-products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continuous  manufacturing where the variable costs of production need to be automatically  computed based on parameters other than output. <strong>Everest</strong>  can track a cost that is linked to the final output such as raw material  cost, but it is not designed to track indirect variable costs that are  linked to other production parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/building-assemblies/img/example.gif" alt="" />  The  production of petroleum products is not only continuous, it also requires  that the production costs include overheads that are computed based on  capacity utilized, or number of machine hours or labor hours.</p>
