  <dt><strong>Online Server</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>Online Server</strong>  check box and the Location drop-down list box below it, pertain to the  <strong>Everest POS Sync Utility</strong> which  allows retail store locations to conduct POS activities without an internet  connection. Select the <strong>Online Server</strong>  checkbox to indicate that this is an <strong>Everest 
 Online Server</strong> (the Main Everest location) and select the exact  location in the field below it. The Administrator will copy the database  from the Online Server location to the Offline Server locations.</dd>
  <dd>Clear the checkbox to indicate that this is a remote  offline POS server location.</dd>
  <dd>You can only modify the <strong>Online 
 Server</strong> and location fields if there are no transactions or if the  transactions are completely processed (synchronized completely). If transactions  exist that are not yet synchronized, you will not be able to change these  fields. Changes will only impact future synchronizations.</dd>
  <dt><strong>(Location)</strong></dt>
  <dd>The location selected from this drop-down list indicates  the location of the <strong>Everest Online Server</strong>.  If “Online Server” is selected, this field is mandatory. If “Online Server”  is not selected because the server is offline, the location of the Online  Server associated with the Offline Server is indicated in this field.</dd>
  <dd>You can only modify the <strong>Online 
 Server</strong> and location fields if there are no transactions or if the  transactions are completely processed (synchronized completely). If transactions  exist that are not yet synchronized, you will not be able to change these  fields. Changes will only impact future synchronizations.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">It is the Administrator’s responsibility to  ensure that the correct online location is defined. We do not recommend  changing it often. If your business requires a change, such as shifting  the headquarters from VA to CA, then it can be done. This will only impact  future synchronizations.</p>
