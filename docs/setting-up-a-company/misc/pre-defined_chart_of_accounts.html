<p>To reduce the amount of time needed to set up your Chart of Accounts,  you can use one of the account templates in <strong>Everest</strong>  as a starting point. Choose <strong>Selecting 
 a COA from a list of pre-defined COAs</strong> ( Reference: <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/accounting_chart_of_accounts_setupco.html"><strong>Accounting - Chart of Accounts</strong> section</a>).  When you select this option, the <strong>Chart 
 of Accounts - Default</strong> section is displayed.</p>

<p>You can select one of four account templates to create your Chart of  Accounts. The <strong>Basic</strong> templates  contain only Level 1 and 2 accounts. The <strong>Detailed</strong>  templates contain all of the accounts necessary to begin processing transactions.</p>

<p>The options available in this section are listed below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Detailed (alphanumeric)</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>Detailed (alphanumeric)</strong>  account template contains all of the accounts necessary to begin processing  transactions. The account codes created are alphanumeric. If you create  your chart of accounts using the <strong>Detailed 
 (alphanumeric)</strong> account template, the accounting defaults and default  payment methods are automatically populated with the appropriate accounts.  Four Company default posting groups are also created.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Detailed (numeric)</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>Detailed (numeric)</strong>  account template also contains all of the accounts necessary to begin  processing transactions, but the account codes created are numeric. If  you create your chart of accounts using the <strong>Detailed
