<p>Enter the next sequence number  for recurring sales orders for the selected location/sub-location. Recurring  sales orders are those sales orders that need to be created continuously  for a certain period of time</p>

<p class="example">Your customer may want to buy your services  for the next one year. You will have to create sales orders at the beginning  of every month for twelve months. Instead of creating a sale order at  the beginning of every month, you can choose <strong>Options</strong><strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Recurring 
 Pattern</strong> from a sales order document, to automatically create sales  orders. The sales orders created will take the recurring number you have  specified for the selected location/sub-location.</p>

<p class="note">Recurring documents can only be created  for non-inventoried items. <strong>This 
 field is not functional since it has been added to provide compatibility 
 with future releases of</strong> <strong>Everest</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
