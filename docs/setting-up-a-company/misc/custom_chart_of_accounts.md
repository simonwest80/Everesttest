If you opted to create your own Chart of Accounts  while setting up your company, first you must create the parent accounts  for the financial categories: **Asset, 
 Liability, Capital, Revenue** and **Expenditure**.

1. Asset


2. Liability


3. Capital


4. Revenue


5. Expenditure


When setting up these accounts, the account **Type**  is always **General**, the Parent  account code is left blank, and the Level is **1**.
