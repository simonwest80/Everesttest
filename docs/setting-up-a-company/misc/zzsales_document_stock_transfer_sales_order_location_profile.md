title: Sales Order

Specify the stock area to which items committed on a sales order must  be transferred.


{:.example}
When you identify the items to be shipped to customers, you move them  to a separate stock area, to segregate them from the items to be shipped  from other stock areas. Such items may be moved to a stock area called  'Packing'.
