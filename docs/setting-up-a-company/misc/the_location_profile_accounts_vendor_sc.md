# The Location Profile – Accounts – Vendor


In the **Vendor** tab, you can specify  the accounts to use for the **Vendor**  control accounts for this location. Accounts defined at the location level  override accounts specified as accounting defaults. While you do not have  to specify accounts for the location being defined, if you have multiple  locations, you may want to define separate accounts to use for each location  for accounting purposes. You can just define the accounts that are different  than the company accounting defaults for each of your locations.


Accounts defined for a **Vendor**  profile or **Vendor Class** will override  accounts specified in the **Location**  profile and accounting defaults.


**Accrued Purchases**
: Select an account defined in the Chart of Accounts  (COA) profile with the Account Type “Accrued Purchases Control” for this  location.
