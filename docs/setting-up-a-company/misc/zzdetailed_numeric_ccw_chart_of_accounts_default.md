title: Detailed (Numeric)
---


The **Detailed (numeric)** account  template also contains all of the accounts necessary to begin processing  transactions, but the account codes created are numeric. If you create  your chart of accounts using the **Detailed 
 (numeric)** account template, the accounting defaults and default  payment methods are automatically populated with the appropriate accounts.  Four Company default posting groups are also created.
