Identify the stock area to which items attached to a debit order must  be transferred when the items are detached.


{:.example}
When items are sent to vendors for repairs or exchange, they are recorded  in a debit order. When the items are returned after repair or exchange,  you can detach them from the debit order. Such items may be moved to a  stock area called 'Repaired Items'.
