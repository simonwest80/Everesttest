<p>By default the account type for any new account is ‘Other’. This indicates  that the chart of account is not a control account. The user may opt to  change the account type from ‘Other’ by Selecting either  ‘Bank’  or any of the control account types for any account being defined in this  profile. Control accounts can be created only for the ‘Detail’ type of  account. An account must be set up in the base currency to be associated  with a control account.</p>
