# Predefined Chart of Accounts


To reduce the amount of time needed to set up your Chart of Accounts,  you can use one of the account templates in **Everest**  as a starting point. Choose **Selecting 
 a COA from a list of pre-defined COAs** ( Reference: [**Accounting - Chart of Accounts** section]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/accounting_chart_of_accounts_setupco.html)).  When you select this option, the **Chart 
 of Accounts - Default** section is displayed.


You can select one of four account templates to create your Chart of  Accounts. The **Basic** templates  contain only Level 1 and 2 accounts. The **Detailed**  templates contain all of the accounts necessary to begin processing transactions.


The options available in this section are listed below:


**Detailed (alphanumeric)**
: The **Detailed (alphanumeric)**  account template contains all of the accounts necessary to begin processing  transactions. The account codes created are alphanumeric. If you create  your chart of accounts using the **Detailed 
 (alphanumeric)** account template, the accounting defaults and default  payment methods are automatically populated with the appropriate accounts.  Four Company default posting groups are also created.


**Detailed (numeric)**
: The **Detailed (numeric)**  account template also contains all of the accounts necessary to begin  processing transactions, but the account codes created are numeric. If  you create your chart of accounts using the **Detailed 
 (numeric)** account template, the accounting defaults and default  payment methods are automatically populated with the appropriate accounts.  Four Company default posting groups are also created.


**Basic (alphanumeric)**
: The **Basic (alphanumeric)**  account template contains Level 1 and Level 2 accounts with alphanumeric  account codes. If you create your chart of accounts using the **Basic 
 (alphanumeric)** account template, you must manually assign your  accounts.


**Basic (numeric)**
: This account template also contains Level 1 and  Level 2 accounts but it has numeric account codes. If you create your  chart of accounts using the **Basic (numeric)**  account template, you must manually assign your accounts.


**Click here to view the selected COA as your company's  COA**
: Use this option to view the details of selected  COA templates before you choose a template for your chart of accounts.


**Click here to create the selected COA as your  company's COA**
: If a predefined COA template suits your requirements,  select the template to use for your COA and click this option to create  the COA in your database. You will be informed that the selected chart  of accounts has been created. Click **OK**  to continue.


**Click here to customize your existing COA**
: Click this option to modify the COA to suit your  company's requirements. This option is enabled only when you create a  Chart of Accounts for your company.
