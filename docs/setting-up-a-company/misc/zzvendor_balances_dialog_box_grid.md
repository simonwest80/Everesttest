All the vendors who are created in your database are listed here. Each  record details the vendor's code, name and currency.


When you enter the opening balance for a vendor in the **Opening 
 Balances** dialog box, it is displayed in the **Opening 
 Balances** columns of this grid in the base as well as the vendor's  currency.
