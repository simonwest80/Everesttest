Payment methods define how the payment must be made, while payment terms  define when the payment must be made.


Use payment terms to compute the due date for payment. Discounts applicable  for early payments are also specified in the **Payment****Terms** profile.


Payment methods can be assigned to payment terms so that for a particular  payment term, payments can be made or received only through the specified  payment methods.


{:.example}
**Make sure that you distinguish between payment  terms and payment methods. For instance, cash and check are payment methods,  whereas Net 30 days and Cash on delivery are payment terms.**
