# User Interface


To sort the security rights based on user interfaces such as browsers  and profiles, click the ![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_sort_by_user_interface.gif) icon on the toolbar.


It is useful to sort the security rights based on user interfaces to  assign rights pertaining to a particular function to the user, but restrict  access to certain user interfaces within that function.


{:.example}
**To restrict a user from modifying invoicing  profiles, sort the security rights based on user interfaces, and select  **Profiles&gt; Invoicing**. Move all  the rights pertaining to invoicing to the **Rights 
 not assigned** column.**
