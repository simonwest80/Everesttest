# Enabling Multiple Companies Option


{:.steps}
To enable Multiple Companies option, do the following:

- Attach the  [Hardware Key]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/protection_key.html) supplied by Everest Software  to a USB port on the Database Server.
- Enter the Multiple  Companies option key in the **Company Setup**  profile that you have registered with Everest Software.
- When you create  new companies, use the same serial number as you did for the company where  the Multiple Companies option key was entered.  When  you do this, you will be asked if you would like to use the Multiple Companies  option to activate this company; select **Yes**.  You do not have to enter registration, validation, or option keys for  this company.  They  will be inherited from the registered company.



{:.note}
- If the database  server is running Windows 2000, you must select the **Multiple 
 Companies** option during installation. The **Multiple 
 Companies** option is located below the **Data 
 Server** option on the **Custom Setup**  dialog box of the Installation Wizard.
- If the database  server is running Windows 2003, the Hardware Key Drivers must be manually  installed on the database server. You must manually run the setup program  for the HASP drivers. The driver installation files can be downloaded  from the Downloads section of the Everest Software, Inc. Customer Support  site.
