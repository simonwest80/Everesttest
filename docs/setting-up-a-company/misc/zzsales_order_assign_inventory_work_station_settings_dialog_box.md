title: Sales Order
---


When you identify items committed to be shipped to customers, move these  items to a separate stock area to segregate them. Use this option to specify  the stock area/bin to which committed shipments made on sales orders are  transferred.


{:.example}
Items that you expect to ship may be moved to a stock area called 'Packing'.
