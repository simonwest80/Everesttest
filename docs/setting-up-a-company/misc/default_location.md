# Default Location


**Everest** creates a default location  called 'Main' for which you can set up the address, logo and sequence  numbers. If you do not want to further classify the locations of your  company, the sequence numbers specified for this location are used.


The default location is specified in the **Default 
 Location** field of the **Accounting**  defaults (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab).  This is a mandatory field.


{:.note}
If the sequence numbers for items, customers, vendors, each type of  sales and purchase document and each type of journal are not specified  for the location of the login  location/sub-location, the sequence numbers specified for the default  location are considered.
