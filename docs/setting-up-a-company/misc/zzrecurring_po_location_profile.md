title: Recurring Purchase Order Number
---


Enter the next sequence number  for recurring purchase orders, for the selected location/sub-location.  Recurring purchase orders need to be created continuously for a certain  period of time.


{:.example}
A vendor may want to sell you services for  the next one year. You need to create purchase orders at the beginning  of every month for a year. Instead of creating a purchase order at the  beginning of every month, you can choose **Options****&gt;** **Recurring 
 Pattern** from a purchase order document, to automatically create  purchase orders. The purchase order created will take the recurring number  you have specified for the selected location/sub-location.


{:.note}
Recurring  documents can only be created for non-inventoried items. **This 
 field is not functional since it has been added to provide compatibility 
 with future releases of** **Everest****.**
