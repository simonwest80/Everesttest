<p>The following fields must be specified only if the payment service selected  is ICVerify.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>License Type</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field specifies the number of users that can  use the service simultaneously. The following options are available:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single-user</strong>  - Only one user can use the service at any given point of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-user</strong>  - Eight users can use the service simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Business Type</strong></dt>
  <dd>The business type identifies whether the authorization  requests are for retail (i.e., direct sale) or mail order type of sales.</dd>
  <dd>Selecting the <strong>Mail</strong><strong>Order</strong> option allows you to choose  one of the following at the time of processing the payment:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>The payment  request for a direct sale.</li>
  <li>Funds to be  booked for a later shipment.</li>
  <li>Funds to be  captured based on an earlier approval number.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Request Directory Name</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is the directory path where the ICVerify  request files are located. You must specify a separate directory path  for each type of card.</dd>
  <dt>The path for MasterCard  cannot be the same as the path for Visa.</dt>
  <dd>The directory path should be the UNC (Universal  Naming Code) path with respect to the <strong>Everest</strong>  application server.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">If ICVerify  is installed in the folder ‘MyWorkstation’,  the UNC path for MasterCard  will be \MyWorkstation\ICVerify\MasterCard.</p>

<dl class="note">
  <dt>The request file path must be in the same local area network as the  <strong>Everest</strong> application server.</dt>

  <dt><strong>Use multiple merchant accounts</strong></dt>
  <dd>Check this option if you are using the multi-user  version of ICVerify that supports multi-merchant accounts. The bank authorizing  your credit card is referred to as the merchant bank. Multiple merchants  is a term used when a company has more than one location to process/authorize  its credit cards, with each location having a different dial-up account  to the bank for getting approvals.</dd>
  <dt>Additional configuration is required to use  ICVerify for Multiple Merchants. Refer to the “Configuring ICVerify for  Multiple Merchants” section.</dt>

  <dt><strong>Sequence</strong></dt>
  <dd>If you are sharing the ICVerify payment processing  software with another company or business, the sequence number defined  here identifies transactions and requests originating from your company.  ICVerify provides a summary of transactions originating from each terminal  based on the merchant sequence number.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">This sequence number can also be used when  you are setting up a processor for each payment terminal or cash counter  for every card type supported by ICVerify. You will also have to set up  a payment method for each processor.</p>
