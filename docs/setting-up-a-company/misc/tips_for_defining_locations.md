# Tips for Defining Locations


Keep the following points in mind while creating locations:

- If your company  has multiple offices situated in different territories, and you require  different sequence numbers, billing address and logos for sales documents  for each area, then create a location for each territory.
- If separate  sequence numbers are required for each sales channel (such as mail order,  web and retail), you must set up each sales channel as a location.
- You must define  a separate location for each office in which **Everest**  is remotely installed.



{:.example}
**A copy of the **Everest**  database is installed in your sales office located in California. Since  you need to carry out the synchronization process at regular intervals,  set up California as a location.**
