<p>The logged in time zone is displayed in this field. The time zone can  be changed as required. This change affects your Contact Manager. It does  not affect your Time Clock schedules since the <strong>Everest</strong>  Time Clock module uses the time from the client workstation’s operating  system settings and not the <strong>Everest</strong>  settings.</p>
