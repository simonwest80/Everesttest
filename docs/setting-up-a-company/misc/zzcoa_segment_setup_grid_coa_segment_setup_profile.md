The segment **Position** field automatically  populates in sequential order. There is a separate line for each segment  created. This is a display only field.

- In the **Length**  field, enter the length of your new segment.
- In the **Short 
 Name** field, enter the **Short Name**  for your new segment. The Short Name cannot be greater than the segment  length.
- In the **Description**  field, enter a description for the new segment.
- Enter information in the **Length**,  **Short Name**, and **Description**  fields for each additional segment you create. The **Current 
 Segment Setup** field updates with your segment format.



{:.note}
Once you create an account, only the segment  length of the last segment can be changed.

- View the **Characters 
 Used** and **Characters Remaining**  fields. Keep this information in mind, especially if you would like to  have room for adding segments to your structure later.
