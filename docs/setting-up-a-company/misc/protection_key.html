<p>The <strong>Everest Multiple Companies</strong>  option requires the use of a hardware key (also called a dongle)This  hardware key must be installed on a parallel port of your database server.  You will also need to launch <strong>Everest</strong>  and enter the 13-digit Multiple Companies Activation Key in your <strong>Company Setup</strong> profile. Once the Multiple  Companies option is activated, all your workstations will be able to log  in to <strong>Everest</strong> if the hardware  key is detected on your database server.</p>

<p class="warn">Take precaution to secure your <strong>Everest</strong>  hardware key. If the original key is returned due to defects, Everest  Software can only provide a replacement hardware key. If your hardware  key is lost or stolen, your copy of <strong>Everest</strong>  will only support one company and you will be required to re-purchase  a full new license with the Multiple Companies option in order to support  more than one company.</p>

<p>Everest Software recommends you purchase insurance for your hardware  key for the amount of your <strong>Everest</strong>  license to protect against possible loss. If you require assistance in  activating your Multiple Companies option, please contact Everest Software’s  technical support team.</p>
