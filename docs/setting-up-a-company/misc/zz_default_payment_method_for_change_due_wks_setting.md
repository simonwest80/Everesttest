Specify the default payment method to be used for change due to customers.


When you receive an excess amount of money from a customer on account  of a Point of Sale transaction, you have to refund the change due to the  customer.


{:.example}
You can set the default payment method for change due to ‘Cash’.


You can also specify the default payment method for change due to customers  in the **Accounting** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab).
