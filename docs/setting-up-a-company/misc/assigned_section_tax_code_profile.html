<p>This section displays all the tax components that are associated to  the tax code. It also displays details such as the code and description,  and the account code to which the tax component is associated.</p>

<p>Two additional columns are displayed in this section:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rank 
 -</strong> This column displays the order in which the tax components are  used to compute tax. This determines the sequence in which the taxes are  calculated.</li>

<p>From the above example, taxes are calculated on an invoice as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The State Duty is  first calculated on the item price ($50 x 0.5% = $0.25).</li>
  <li>The County Sales  Tax and the State Sales Tax are calculated for the item after adding the  State Duty ($50.25 x 1.5% = $0.75; $50.25 x 2.5% = $1.26).</li>
  <li>The invoice total  is the total of the item price and all the taxes. Invoice total = $52.26  ($50 + $0.25 + $.0.75 + $1.26).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The order of the tax components can be changed  by selecting the component and clicking the <strong>Up</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/img/setup_up_arrow.gif" alt="" /> and <strong>Down</strong> <img src="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/img/setup_down_arrow.gif" alt="" /> arrows.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tax 
 Bases -</strong> Tax components can be individually taxable in some cases.  This means that tax is also calculated on the tax that is computed based  on the selected tax component. Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/img/setup_browse_icon.gif" alt="" /> icon and you  will see <strong>Tax 
 on Tax</strong> dialog box. Choose the base amounts on which tax will  be computed for the selected tax component.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">In the previous example, the Tax Component  ‘State Duty’ is defined as taxable and therefore ‘County Sales Tax’ and  ‘State Sales Tax’ are computed for the item after first adding ‘State  Duty’ to the item price.</p>

<p>The taxes applicable to an item of $100 are  State Duty at 10 percent and County Sales Tax at 5 percent. The tax component  ‘State Duty’  is taxable. The tax would therefore be computed as 100*10% + (100 + (100*10%))*5%  = $15.50.</p>
