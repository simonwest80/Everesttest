<p>You would normally commit items on a purchase order when the items are  on approval basis and you want to inspect them and verify their quality.  Use this option to assign a stock area/bin to transfer items received  against a purchase order.</p>

<p class="note">Only a stock area/bin of type ‘Out’ can be  selected, as items received in this area are not a part of your stock  until a purchase receipt is created for them.</p>

<p class="example">Items received for approval may be moved to a stock area called ‘Inspection’.</p>
