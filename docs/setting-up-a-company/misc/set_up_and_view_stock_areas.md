# Set up and View Stock Areas


<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">Inventory that you buy or sell can move through different 
 areas called stock areas.</font> Defining different stock areas helps  keep track of the inventory in each area. A stock area may be a physical  location such as a warehouse or a virtual area such as stock-in-transit.


You can allocate items to stock areas from where they are retrieved  at the time of sale.


Click **Click 
 here to setup stock areas** to create a stock area. You will see  the **Stock Area** profile.
