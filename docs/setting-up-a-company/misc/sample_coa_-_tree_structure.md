Chart of Accounts - Tree Structure


Detail accounts contain transactions details. When you post the transactions,  the general accounts are updated with the balances of the detail accounts,  and the general accounts at the top-most level (if any) are in turn updated  by the balances of the general accounts under them.


System generated journals can be viewed and then posted to update the  General Ledger.
