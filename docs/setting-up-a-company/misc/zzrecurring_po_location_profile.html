<p>Enter the next sequence number  for recurring purchase orders, for the selected location/sub-location.  Recurring purchase orders need to be created continuously for a certain  period of time.</p>

<p class="example">A vendor may want to sell you services for  the next one year. You need to create purchase orders at the beginning  of every month for a year. Instead of creating a purchase order at the  beginning of every month, you can choose <strong>Options</strong><strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Recurring 
 Pattern</strong> from a purchase order document, to automatically create  purchase orders. The purchase order created will take the recurring number  you have specified for the selected location/sub-location.</p>

<p class="note">Recurring  documents can only be created for non-inventoried items. <strong>This 
 field is not functional since it has been added to provide compatibility 
 with future releases of</strong> <strong>Everest</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
