# The Initial Item Quantities Dialog Box


The **Initial Item Quantities**  dialog box displays all the items that are created in your database. Enter  the stock of items in the **Quantity**  column and the average cost per unit of the item in the **Average 
 Cost** column. You cannot enter fractional and negative quantities  in the **Quantity** column.


The stock area can be changed for the required items by clicking the  **Stock Area** column and selecting  a stock area from the drop-down list.


The stock value is automatically computed based on the average cost  and the quantity of the items. In the case of serialized items, serial  numbers are generated automatically and the average cost is used as the  actual cost of each serial number of the item.


{:.note}
You can enter the above details only at the  time of creating a company. You cannot modify the quantities displayed  in this dialog box once you have made transactions in the company.


Enter the quantities and the cost of the items, and click **OK**  to return to the **Company Creation Wizard**.


When you click **OK**, an accounting  entry is automatically created where the **Inventory 
 Control** account is **debited**  and the **Unreconciled Difference** account  is **credited** with the value of  the inventory.


{:.note}
Once the details are saved, you can neither  edit the quantities and values entered here, nor can you make further  entries.
