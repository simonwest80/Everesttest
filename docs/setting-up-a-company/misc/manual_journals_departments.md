# Manual Journals


When a transaction is created manually in a sales, receipt, payment,  general or purchase journal, it is assigned to the login  location/sub-location.


You may also specify location/sub-location for each account debited  or credited in the transaction. Thus, the revenues and expenses for each  cost or profit center can be measured.
