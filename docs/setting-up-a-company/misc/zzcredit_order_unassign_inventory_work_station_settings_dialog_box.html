<p>When a customer intends to return items, the items are committed in  a credit order. If a stock area/bin is specified in the <strong>Assign 
 inventory from &gt; Credit Order</strong> field, items are assigned to this  stock area/bin.</p>

<p>If, at a later date, the customer does not return the items due to some  reason, or you do not accept the returns due to some warranty or company  policy, the items must be detached from the credit order.</p>

<p>Specify the stock area/bin where such items must be transferred.</p>

<p class="example">Customer returns not finally accepted due to expiry  of the warranty period are unassigned and moved to a stock area/bin called  “Returns Not Accepted”.</p>
