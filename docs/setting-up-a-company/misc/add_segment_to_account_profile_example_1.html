<p class="example">A company has a Segment Format of Div-Dep-Bra-Acct  (Division, Department, Branch, and Account). The accounts that have been  created are:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Existing Accounts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>001-001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>001-001-mai</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>001-001-mai-5200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>002</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>002-001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>002-002</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>002-003</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>002-004</td>

    <tr>
      <td>002-005</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Division 1 posts at the account level and Division 2 currently posts  at the department level. Division 2 would like to post at the branch level  since they added a new NC branch.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Chart of Accounts</strong> browser,  the user highlights account 002-001 and selects the <strong>Add 
 Segment to Account</strong> option.</p>

<p>The <strong>Parent Account Code</strong> field  displays 002-001. The <strong>Account Code</strong>  field displays 002-001-000 since the length of the branch segment is three.  The original account, 002-001, becomes a general account and the balances  from this account are transferred to the new account.</p>
