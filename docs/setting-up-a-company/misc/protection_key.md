# Hardware Key

You will also need to launch **Everest**  and enter the 13-digit Multiple Companies Activation Key in your **Company Setup** profile. Once the Multiple  Companies option is activated, all your workstations will be able to log  in to **Everest** if the hardware  key is detected on your database server.

Take precaution to secure your **Everest**  hardware key. If the original key is returned due to defects, Everest  Software can only provide a replacement hardware key. If your hardware  key is lost or stolen, your copy of **Everest**  will only support one company and you will be required to re-purchase  a full new license with the Multiple Companies option in order to support  more than one company.


Everest Software recommends you purchase insurance for your hardware  key for the amount of your **Everest**  license to protect against possible loss. If you require assistance in  activating your Multiple Companies option, please contact Everest Softwareâ€™s  technical support team.
