<p>A ‘Measure’ is used to quantify an item. The price of an item is fixed  per unit of sales measure.</p>

<p class="example">Hour, inch, foot, yard, pint, quart, gallon,  bushel, ounce, pound, short ton, long ton, each, six-pack, case, dozen,  hundred etc.</p>

<p>Measures are used to price items in formats other than a single unit.  The measure to be used for an item is specified when the item is created  in the <strong>Item</strong> profile. <strong>Everest</strong>  can maintain different units of measure for the sale and purchase of an  item.</p>

<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000" class="example">You may buy an item in larger quantities, say pounds, 
 and sell it in smaller quantities, say ounces.</font>
