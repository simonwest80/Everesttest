<p>Use the <strong>Chart of Accounts Balances</strong> dialog box to enter the opening balances of your account. All accounts  that have been created are listed here.</p>

<p class="note">You can enter the opening balances of your  accounts only at the time of creating a company. You cannot modify the  balances displayed in this dialog box once you have made transactions  in the company.</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Debit</strong>/<strong>Credit</strong> column beside the <strong>Account Description</strong> to enter the account balance. Negative amounts cannot be entered.  You cannot enter a debit and credit amount for one account. You can enter  a maximum of 15 integers and 4 decimals.</p>

  <dt><strong>Debit in Foreign Currency/Credit in Foreign Currency</strong></dt>

In the <strong>Debit in Foreign Currency</strong> and <strong>Credit in Foreign Currency</strong> fields, <em>**</em> enter the balance in foreign currency by specifying the currency  code and amount.</dd>

<p class="example">If you want an account balance in Indian Rupees,  enter the amount as INR  20,000.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Unreconciled Differences</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>Unreconciled 
 Differences</strong> field displays the difference between the debit and  credit columns. This difference in account is nullified when you import  or enter all the balances pertaining to inventory, accounts receivable,  accounts payable and input the balances of all the other accounts in your  chart of accounts. If this account displays any balance after all the  account balances of your opening Trial Balance have been brought in, it  means that your opening Trial Balance has not tied up.</dd>
