title: Credit Order

Specify the stock area to which stocks committed on a credit order must  be transferred.


When you issue a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) to customers,  you attach the items to be returned to the credit order.


{:.example}
**Defectives expected to be returned or items  sent by customers for exchange or repairs may be moved to a stock area  called 'Customer RMA expected'.**
