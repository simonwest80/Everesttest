<p>You can add segments at any time after creating your initial segment  format.</p>

<p class="note">You can only add segments if your existing  account format has not reached the maximum of 40 characters without segment  separators or 45 characters with segment separators.</p>

<p class="steps">To add segments to your existing segment  format, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main menu bar, select <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Segments</strong>. You will see the  <strong>COA Segment Setup</strong> profile. Existing  segments display in position order.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Number 
 of Segments</strong> field, increase the number of segments by the number  of segments to be created. New lines will be added for each new segment  to be created.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">If you have three existing segments and you  would like to add one more, change the number of segments from 3 to 4.  A fourth line is added to the list of segments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>Segment 
 Separator</strong> field, verify the character to be used to distinguish  your segments. Change the segment separator, if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can change the Segment Separator from  the <strong>COA Segment Setup</strong> profile  at any time. A segment does not have to be created to do this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>Length</strong>  field, enter the length of your new segment.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Short 
 Name</strong> field, enter the <strong>Short Name</strong>  for your new segment. The Short Name cannot be greater than the segment  length.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Description</strong>  field, enter a description for the new segment.</li>
  <li>Enter information in the <strong>Length</strong>,  <strong>Short Name</strong>, and <strong>Description</strong>  fields for each additional segment you create. The <strong>Current 
 Segment Setup</strong> field updates with your segment format.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Once you create an account, only the segment  length of the last segment can be changed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>View the <strong>Characters 
 Used</strong> and <strong>Characters Remaining</strong>  fields. Keep this information in mind, especially if you would like to  have room for adding segments to your structure later.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>Delete</strong>  option to remove a segment from your segment format, if necessary.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>Move 
 Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong> options  to position your segments correctly in the segment structure.</li>
  <li>When you are satisfied with your segment format,  click the <strong>Save</strong> button to save  your changes.</li>
  <li>If you enter a segment length of more than six  characters, a <strong>Confirmation</strong> dialog  box is displayed. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to  continue to create the segment or click <strong>No</strong>  to return to the segment and adjust the segment length.</li>
</ul>

<p>After creating your new segment or segments, they must be attached to  accounts.</p>
