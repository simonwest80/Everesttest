<p><strong>Customer payment methods</strong> should  be associated with a clearing account (sometimes known as undeposited  funds), which acts as a drawer on your desk. When funds are collected  from customers, the check/cash/credit slip is put in your drawer.</p>

<p>The collections are verified at the end of each business day and a general  journal entry is made to transfer funds from the payment clearing account  to your bank account. This transfer acts as your bank deposit and creates  the proper transactions to achieve a simple bank reconciliation procedure  at the end of the month.</p>

<p>You must reduce the payment clearing account balance to zero for the  next day’s operations.</p>

<p><strong>Vendor payment methods</strong> should  be associated with your bank account, as funds are directly drawn from  your account when payments are made.</p>
