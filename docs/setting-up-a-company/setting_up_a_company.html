<p><strong>Everest</strong> is multiple-company  enabled. It can be used to run the operations of more than one company.  The company set up process involves identifying the critical components  of a company’s database such as the code that identifies the company,  its location, its chart of accounts, items, customers and vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides you with the  <strong>Company Creation Wizard</strong> to take  you through each step in the set up process. You cannot create a company  database from any other area or menu option.</p>

<p class="steps">To create a company, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; New Company</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/the_everest_administrator_login_dialog_box.html"><strong>Everest Administrator Login</strong> dialog box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You must have rights to create a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the details  and click <strong>OK</strong>. You will see the  <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/the-company-creation-wizard/the_company_creation_wizard.html">Company Creation Wizard</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/the-company-creation-wizard/company/company_information_name_company_setup.html">Company  Information - Name section</a>.</li>
  <li>Enter the details  and click <strong>Create Company</strong>.</li>
  <li>A company is  created with the code and name specified.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Company 
 Creation Wizard</strong> is called the <strong>Company 
 Setup Wizard</strong> when it is accessed after the initial company creation.  Once the company has been created, you can also access the <strong>Company 
 Setup Wizard</strong> by selecting <strong>File 
 &gt; Company Wizard</strong> from the main menu bar.</p>
