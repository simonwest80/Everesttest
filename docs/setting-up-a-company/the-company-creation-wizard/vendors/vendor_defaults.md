# Vendor Defaults


When you create a vendor, certain fields in the **Vendor**  profile are populated by the defaults that you set. These fields are listed  below:

- The type of  payment terms allowed by vendors.
- The default  payment term.
- The delivery  method (the carrier and delivery option) for shipping items to your location.



These defaults can be changed for individual vendors. Setting such defaults  minimizes the data entry required to create a vendor.
