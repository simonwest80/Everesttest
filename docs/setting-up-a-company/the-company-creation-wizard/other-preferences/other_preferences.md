# Other Preferences


You can customize **Everest** for  your business needs through the **Flow 
 Control and** **Default** preferences.  Use this section to define these settings.


{:.example}
You can direct the system to automatically  print documents. You can also restrict access to documents.


It is very important that you go through each of these options as they  can make a significant difference to the efficiency and practical usefulness  of **Everest**.


{:.note}
The applicable preferences to each section  in **Everest** are detailed under  the respective section. For example, Item preferences and Defaults are  dealt with under the chapter Managing Items.

- [Defaults]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/other-preferences/defaults.html)



After specifying the preferences, click **Next**.  You will see the [**Conclusion** section]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/conclusion/conclusion_company_creation_wizard.html) of the wizard.
