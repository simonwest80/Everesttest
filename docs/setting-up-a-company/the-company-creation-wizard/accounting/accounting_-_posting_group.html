<p>The concept of Posting Groups allows for a wide scope in the creation  of accounts. You need not confine yourself to a single set of accounts  for all your customer and vendor transactions.</p>

<p>Posting Groups allow you to configure varying sets of accounts to provide  you greater control over your business transactions. Each set of account  can be created as a Posting Group. Most commonly used sets of accounts  can be defined at a single point. Whenever you make a transaction, the  specified posting group is selected by default in the document and so  all the accounts relevant to the transaction are picked from that Posting  Group . Modifications to an account can be made at the posting group level  obviating the need to manually change the account for each item or transaction  falling under that category. This makes Posting Groups a sure-shot time  saver.</p>

<p class="example">You want to change the revenue account from  R100 to R700 for 100 items belonging to the category ‘Consumer Durables’.  This category has been assigned the   Inventory   Posting  Group ‘CONSUMER ITEMS’. Instead of having to change the account for each  of the hundred items manually, you can change the account at the Posting  Group level; this change is reflected in the Consumer Durable category  and subsequently for all the 100 items falling under that category.</p>

<p class="steps">To create a posting group, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File</strong>&gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Posting Groups</strong>. You will  see the <strong>Posting Groups</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>. You will see  the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/acc-info/posting-group/posting_group_profile_accounting_setup.html"><strong>Posting 
 Group</strong> profile</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Posting groups can also be created from either of the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From an existing  <strong>Posting Group</strong> profile by clicking  <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong>.</li>
  <li>From any profile/dialog  box that contains the <strong>Posting Group</strong>  field by selecting <strong>New</strong> from the  right-click menu option available from the drop-down list of the field.</li>
</ul>
