# Accounting - Chart of Accounts


The **Chart of Accounts** is a list  of all your accounts and is the heart of your accounting system. All transactions  are posted to accounts. The financial result of a company's operations  is derived from the values accumulated in these accounts.


Use this section to either [set  up your own chart of accounts]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/custom_chart_of_accounts.html) or select a [predefined  chart of accounts]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/pre-defined_chart_of_accounts.html).


{:.note}
You can discontinue accounts from the Chart  of Accounts after you create them by selecting **Accounting 
 &gt; Chart of Accounts**. You will see the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser. Highlight the required accounts and select  **Options &gt; Discontinue**.


You cannot discontinue a chart of account  that:

- has a non-zero balance
- has a detail account  beneath it
- is assigned to a posting  group
- is assigned to a payment  method
- is included in an unposted  journal
- is used in **Everest**  US Payroll


Click **Next** after creating or  selecting your chart of accounts. The [**Accounting - Defaults** section]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/accounting_defaults_setupco.html) is  displayed.


{:.note}
: If the **Copy setup 
 information from an existing company** option is selected from the  [Company - Template]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/company/company_template_ccw_sc.html) screen, you  will see the [Accounting  - Chart of Accounts - Template]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/accounting_chart_of_accounts_template_ccw_sc.html) screen.
