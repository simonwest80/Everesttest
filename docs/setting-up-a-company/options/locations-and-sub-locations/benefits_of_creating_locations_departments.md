# Benefits of Creating Locations/Sub-Locations


Classifying the Locations/Sub-Locations  of your company offers you the following advantages:

- The financial  performance of each location can be tracked and evaluated.
- Provides you  with information on the contribution of each cost center and profit center  to the total costs and revenues of the location.
- Each location  can have a separate set of sequence numbers for purchase and sales documents.
- Every location  can have its own logo for printing on documents.
- Customers and  vendors can be assigned to locations/sub-locations leading to better management  of accounts receivable and payable.
- Users can be  assigned to locations/sub-locations to identify the exact position of  each user within the organization. Preferences can be set to ensure that  a user is not able to view the documents created by other locations/sub-locations.
- It enables  you to track expenses and revenue for each cost center and profit center  within a location and across sub-locations.



{:.example}
**If you have set up two locations - Virginia  and California and sub-locations Virginia Sales and California Sales -  you can obtain a report on the individual revenues of the two sub-locations  as well as combined revenues for both.**
