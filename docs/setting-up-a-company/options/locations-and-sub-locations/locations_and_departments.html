<p>As a company grows, it becomes necessary to track the activities of  business segments within the company. Several companies create departments,  cost centers and profit centers based on location, functions, revenue  channels, product lines, or a combination of these.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows multiple layers  of location classification. The highest level in the hierarchy is called  ‘Locations’; the others are called ‘Sub-Locations’.</p>

<p class="example">You may have places of business in Virginia and North Carolina. You  can set them up as locations. You can then set up your sales and administration  functions as sub-locations for both Virginia and North Carolina. Further,  you can set up sub-locations for sales of computer hardware and software,  under the sales sub-location in each case.
