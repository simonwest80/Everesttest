<h1 id="sub-locations">Sub-Locations</h1>

<p>A sub-location forms a child to the location, i.e., a sub-location always  falls under a location in the hierarchy. Each sub-location should have  a parent location. A sub-location can have any number of levels of sub-locations  below it.</p>

<p>The following may be created as a sub-location:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost 
 centers</strong> – Create cost centers such as manufacturing units as sub-locations.  Cost centers are used to allocate expenses and revenues. This allows you  to evaluate the profitability of any cost center.</li>
  <li><strong>Profit 
 centers</strong> – Create profit centers such as product lines and sales  channels as sub-locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Functions</strong> – Create functions such as Administration, Finance, Marketing and  Distribution as sub-locations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>To use a single sequence number, billing address,  and logo for several sub-locations, create sub-locations under the default  location - ‘Main’.</strong></p>
