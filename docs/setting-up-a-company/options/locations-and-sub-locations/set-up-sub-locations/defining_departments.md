# Sub-Locations


A sub-location forms a child to the location, i.e., a sub-location always  falls under a location in the hierarchy. Each sub-location should have  a parent location. A sub-location can have any number of levels of sub-locations  below it.


The following may be created as a sub-location:

- **Cost 
 centers** – Create cost centers such as manufacturing units as sub-locations.  Cost centers are used to allocate expenses and revenues. This allows you  to evaluate the profitability of any cost center.
- **Profit 
 centers** – Create profit centers such as product lines and sales  channels as sub-locations.
- **Functions** – Create functions such as Administration, Finance, Marketing and  Distribution as sub-locations.

**To use a single sequence number, billing address,  and logo for several sub-locations, create sub-locations under the default  location - 'Main'.**
