# The Location Profile - Image


Use the **Image** tab to specify  the logo for each location.


{:.steps}
To specify a logo for a location, do the following:

- Click the lookup  button. You will see the **Open**  dialog box.
- Select the  appropriate logo.



The selected logo will be displayed in the image window. After specifying  the details, save the profile.


Each location can have its own logo. This logo is displayed on all purchase  and sales documents created for the location. The recommended size for  the bitmap is 5.0 x 1.4 inches or 254 x 124 pixels. Only file formats  of the type .BMP are supported. The recommended file size of the logo  is less than 1 MB. Â However  sub-locations cannot have separate logos.


{:.note}
If  the file size exceeds 1 MB, the performance of report printing job may  be affected because the logo must be copied to the local workstation for  each print job.


{:.example}
A different logo can be specified for the  retail store and distribution outlets that are set up as locations. Thus,  sales invoices printed for the retail store will bear a different logo  from those printed for the distribution store.
