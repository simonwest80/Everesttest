# Discontinue a Location/Sub-Location


When you discontinue a location/sub-location, it is not deleted from  the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued location/sub-location  can be made available for selection by activating it.


In case a location/sub-location has sub-locations under it, all the  lower level sub-locations are also discontinued when the location/sub-location  to which they are associated is discontinued. Discontinuing a location/sub-location  does not affect documents or journals already created for that location/sub-location.


{:.note}
**The default location cannot be discontinued.  The location/sub-location selected during login  or specified in the **Workstation Settings** of any user who has logged in cannot be discontinued.**
