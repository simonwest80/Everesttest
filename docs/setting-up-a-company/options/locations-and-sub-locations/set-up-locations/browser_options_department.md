# The Locations/Sub-Locations Browser


The **Locations/Sub-Locations** browser  (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Locations/Sub-Locations**) displays all the locations and sub-locations  that have been defined.


The **Show Treeview**![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_show_treeview.gif) icon enables you to toggle between the 'normal view'  and 'tree view' of the locations/sub-locations. All options available  in the standard **Location/Sub-Locations** browser are also available here.


To revert to the normal browser view, click the **Hide 
 Treeview**![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_hide_treeview.gif) icon.


Options common to all browsers in **Everest**  are also available in this browser.
