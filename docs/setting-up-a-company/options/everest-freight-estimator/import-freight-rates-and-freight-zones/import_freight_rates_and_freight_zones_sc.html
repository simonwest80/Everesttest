<p>Freight estimation in <strong>Everest</strong>  is not limited to the freight calculations based on weight or other options  available in the <strong>Zone</strong> and <strong>Rate</strong> profiles.</p>

<p>Extensive freight estimation is possible in <strong>Everest</strong>  by importing freight details from the respective carrier websites such  as UPS and FedEx. <strong>Everest</strong> calculates  the freight based on the zones and rates defined by these carriers.</p>

<p class="note">You can download the freight zones and rates  for UPS and FedEx from www.ups.com and www.fedex.com. You can import them  into <strong>Everest</strong> in the appropriate  format.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Data Import Wizard</strong> (path:  <strong>Utility</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong>  &gt; <strong>Data</strong>) to import the freight  rates and freight zones. The freight zones must be imported before the  freight rates since the rates are defined for the zones.</p>
