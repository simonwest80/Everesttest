<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Delivery methods that are not required can be discontinued. 
 </font>
<p>When you discontinue a delivery method, the record is not deleted  from the database; it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued 
 delivery method can be made available for selection by activating it again.</font></p>

<p>If the default delivery method for a customer or vendor is discontinued  when you create a document, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you that the delivery method does not exist.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a delivery method, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Freight &gt; Delivery Methods</strong>. You will see the <strong>Delivery 
 Methods</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Delivery Methods</strong> browser, highlight  the record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The selected record that was selected  is no longer visible in the <strong>Delivery 
 Methods</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
