<p>Delivery methods are the methods by which items are delivered to your  customer or received from your vendor. A single carrier may provide delivery  services of varying kinds. You can opt for a certain delivery method according  to your specific requirement. You can use the same delivery method for  receiving or issuing items.</p>

<p>Some of the Delivery Methods created when setting up your company are  listed below:</p>

<p>You can define additional methods as needed. Delivery methods provide  information to the shipment department on how all deliveries are to be  made.</p>

<p>Setting up delivery methods enables you to do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compute the  freight on item sales.</li>
  <li>Plan shipments  and prepare shipment manifests.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">Set up different delivery methods associated with the carrier.</p>

<p class="example">Set up delivery methods Fedex Next Day and Fedex Priority Overnight  for the carrier Fedex.</p>
