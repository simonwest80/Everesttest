# Zones


A zone is the location where an order is to be shipped. It can be a  single state, a country or a region, depending on how you want to charge  freight on shipments. For **Everest**  to calculate the freight charges you must define both the zone and the  zone details.


{:.steps}
To create a zone, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File** > **Setup** > **Freight**  > **Zones**. You will see the **Zones** browser.
- From the **Zones** browser, select **Options**  > **New** > **In 
 New Window**. You will see the [**Zones Profile**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/everest-freight-estimator/zones/destination_zones_profile.html).
