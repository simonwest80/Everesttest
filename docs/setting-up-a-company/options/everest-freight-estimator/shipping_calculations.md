# Everest Freight Estimator


Freight is the shipment of goods from your company/warehouse to the  shipping address or vice versa and freight rate is the charge applicable  to ship the ordered items. You can estimate the freight payable on items  shipped to customers or shipped from/to vendors using the **Everest 
 Freight Estimator** (EFE).  EFE is a multi-carrier  freight charges calculator. It calculates the freight between any two  ZIP codes in the U.S. For international customers, you have to specify  the zones (for the origin and destination countries) for computing the  freight charges on items.

Freight charges also include related costs like COD, Residential charges,  and Insurance.


On the online store, the shopper can view the shipping calculator only  at the time of checking out. By selecting the delivery methods from the  drop-down list, the shopper can view the different freight charges for  the items.
