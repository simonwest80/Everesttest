<p>Payflow Pro  is a payment service that <strong>Everest</strong>  uses for credit card processing. <strong>Everest</strong>  communicates with the <strong>Payflow 
 Pro</strong> gateway through the Internet using the port specified in the  <strong>Processor</strong> profile.</p>

<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">The process may be 
 detailed as follows:</font>

<ul>
  <li>The cardholder  presents the card for a purchase. This information is either swiped or  entered into the system.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Everest</strong>  workstation sends the payment information and payment method details to  the <strong>Everest</strong> server.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Everest</strong>  application server communicates to the Payflow  Pro payment gateway via the Internet.</li>
  <li>The request  is routed through the payment network and the cardholder’s bank is contacted  for payment approval or address verification.</li>
  <li>If the request  is for payment approval, the cardholder’s bank sends an approval number  to the payment gateway. The approved amount is transferred to your bank  account.</li>
  <li>The Payflow  Pro payment gateway then communicates the response to the <strong>Everest</strong>  application server via the Internet.</li>
  <li>This response  is then displayed on the workstation that initiated the request.</li>
</ul>
