    <tr>
      <td>CLERK</td>
      <td>Denotes the user. <strong>Everest</strong> uses  this field to specify the merchant sequence number if multiple merchants  are enabled for the processor (path: <strong>Processor</strong>  profile &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Use Multiple Accounts</strong> field is  selected).</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SWIPEINFO%</td>
      <td>Indicates the swipe information with ‘%’.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TRACK1</td>
      <td>Denotes Track 1 data for the swipe information. This parameter is used  if only Track 1 data is required by the processing network.</td>

The tax information is mandatory for some processing networks and  is required as a Tier 1 data for Purchase Cards. <strong>Everest</strong>  computes the proportional tax for the payment amount (i.e. tax is computed  in proportion to the payment amount and document amount).
