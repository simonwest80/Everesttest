Set up a processor for each merchant account that you will  use to process credit cards.


{:.example}
A business has two merchant accounts with  their merchant bank, one for retail and one for online sales. They set  up a processor in Everest for both merchant accounts.


If you are using multiple processors for ICVerify,  assign a sequence number for each processor.

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Processors**. You will see the **Processors** browser.
- From the **Processors** browser select **Options**  > **New &gt; In New Window**. You  will see the [**Processors** profile]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/payment-information/credit-card-processing/create-a-processor/the_processors_profile.html).



{:.note}
You can also create a processor in any of the following ways:

- From an existing  **Processors** profile by clicking  **Options &gt; New**.
- From any profile/dialog  box that contains the **Processor**  field by selecting **New** from the  right-click menu options.
