# Discontinue a Processor


You may want to discontinue a processor, if you no longer use the credit  card payment service for which the processor was set up. If you discontinue  a processor, you must modify the credit card payment methods to which  the processor is assigned and replace it with the processor you want to  use.


When you discontinue a processor, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made  available for selection by activating it again.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a processor, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Processors**. You will see the **Processors** browser.
- From the **Processors** browser, highlight the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the **Processors**  browser.
