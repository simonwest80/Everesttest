<p>When credit card payment methods are created, the processor to be used  for authorization must be defined. Processors are not defined for the  default payment methods created when a new company is set up.</p>

<p>You must define processor details as given to you by the payment service  or software supplier before defining a credit card payment method. Use  the <strong>Processor</strong> profile to create  processors for each payment method.</p>

<p>You can set up a processor that will use any of the following services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ICVerify</li>
  <li>The Payflow  Pro</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Refer to the instructional materials provided  by your payment service for detailed information for the fields in the  **Processor</strong> profile.**</p>
