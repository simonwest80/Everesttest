# Create a Processor


When credit card payment methods are created, the processor to be used  for authorization must be defined. Processors are not defined for the  default payment methods created when a new company is set up.


You must define processor details as given to you by the payment service  or software supplier before defining a credit card payment method. Use  the **Processor** profile to create  processors for each payment method.


You can set up a processor that will use any of the following services:

- The ICVerify
- The Payflow  Pro



{:.note}
**Refer to the instructional materials provided  by your payment service for detailed information for the fields in the  **Processor** profile.**
