<p>Payment terms that are not required can be discontinued. If a payment  term is discontinued after it is selected in a document, payment discounts  continue to be calculated based on the discount terms mentioned in the  <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Terms</strong>  profile. However, the payment term is not available for selection in a  new document.</p>

<p>When you discontinue a payment term, the record is not deleted from  the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued payment term can be made  available for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p>If the default payment term for a customer or vendor is discontinued,  it will still be displayed by default when you create a document. Change  the default payment term for customers/vendors, when the payment term  is discontinued.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a payment term, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Payment Terms</strong>. You will see the <strong>Payment 
 Terms</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Payment Terms</strong> browser, highlight the  record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong><font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the <strong>Payment 
 Terms</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
