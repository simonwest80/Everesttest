# Discontinue a Payment Term


Payment terms that are not required can be discontinued. If a payment  term is discontinued after it is selected in a document, payment discounts  continue to be calculated based on the discount terms mentioned in the  **Payment** **Terms**  profile. However, the payment term is not available for selection in a  new document.


When you discontinue a payment term, the record is not deleted from  the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued payment term can be made  available for selection by activating it again.


If the default payment term for a customer or vendor is discontinued,  it will still be displayed by default when you create a document. Change  the default payment term for customers/vendors, when the payment term  is discontinued.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a payment term, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Payment Terms**. You will see the **Payment 
 Terms** browser.
- From the **Payment Terms** browser, highlight the  record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the **Payment 
 Terms** browser.
