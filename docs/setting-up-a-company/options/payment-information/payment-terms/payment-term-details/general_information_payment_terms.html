  <dd>The code is the unique identifier of the payment  term while the description specifies the name of the payment term. Once  a payment term is defined, you cannot modify the code.</dd>

<p><strong>Payment Term Type</strong></p>

<p>Use this option to select the type of payment term. The following options  are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>On 
 Account -</strong> Select this option for payment to be made  on credit.</li>
  <li><strong>COD</strong>  - Select this option for payment to be received from the customer or made  to the vendor only on the delivery of goods.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepay</strong>  - When you select this option, the customer’s goods are shipped only when  the payment is made in full or in part. This is also applicable for payments  made to the vendor, before the shipment of goods begins.</li>
</ul>

<p>: When a sales order with prepay terms is converted  to a sales invoice, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts  you with the same, subject to the preference set in the <strong>Documents</strong>  dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts &gt; Sales Documents 
 &gt; Sales Documents 1 &gt; Method for applying deposit collected on a 
 sales order when converting it into a sales invoice</strong>).</p>

<p class="note">On selecting the <strong>COD</strong>  or <strong>Prepay</strong> options, the <strong>Due 
 Date Typ</strong>e field in the <strong>Due</strong><strong>Date</strong> <strong>Information</strong>  section is disabled.</p>

<p class="hint">For credit cards, you would ideally set up the payment term as prepaid.</p>
