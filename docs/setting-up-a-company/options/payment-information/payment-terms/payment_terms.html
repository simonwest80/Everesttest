<p>Payment terms define the different terms of payment such as ‘Due on  receipt’ or  ‘Prepay’ that your company extends to customers and receives from vendors.  You can use the same terms for issuing or receiving a payment, or set  up separate codes for each.</p>

<p>Defining the payment terms enables the system to compute the due date  for payments and the discounts applicable if any. The finance charges  for late payments are also computed from the payment due dates.</p>

<p>When creating a company, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates the following payment terms by default:</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>RMA <font face="verdana" class="hcp4">–</font> Refund</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>RMA <font face="verdana" class="hcp4">–</font> Replacement</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>You can define additional payment terms as needed.</p>

<p>The RMA terms referred to in the table above are used for reporting  purposes, when a product is returned from a customer, or to a vendor.  Use these terms to record the understanding between the customer/vendor  and your company.</p>

<p class="example">You can print a report of Accounts Receivable  for only the RREF  (RMA – Refund) terms to do a check run for refunds.</p>
