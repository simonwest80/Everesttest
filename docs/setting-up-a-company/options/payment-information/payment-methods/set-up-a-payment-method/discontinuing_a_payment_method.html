<p>Payment methods which are not required can be discontinued. When you  discontinue a payment method, the record is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. A discontinued payment method can be made available  for selection by activating it again.</p>

<p>If the default payment method for a customer or vendor is discontinued,  when you make or receive payments, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you that the payment method does not exist. You can then select  the required payment method.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a payment method, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Payment Methods</strong>. You will see the <strong>Payment 
 Methods</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Payment Methods</strong> browser, highlight the  record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The selected  record is no longer visible in the <strong>Payment 
 Methods</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
