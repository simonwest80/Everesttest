<p>The <strong>Payment Methods</strong> browser  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods</strong>) displays a list of the payment methods that  have been created.</p>

<p>To maintain confidentiality of account balances associated with payment  methods, you must log in to the extended mode. In doing so, you can prevent  users who are making payments to vendors or receiving payments from customers  from viewing sensitive information pertaining to vendor or customer balances.  Only authorized personnel can be granted access to this information, so  as not to overdraw the bank account.</p>

<p>The following columns in the <strong>Payment 
 Methods</strong> browser display asterisks ******** instead of the actual  amount to users who do not have a right to extended mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Current balance</li>
  <li>Posted balance</li>
  <li>Unposted balance</li>
  <li>Current balance  (Foreign currency)</li>
  <li>Posted balance  (Foreign currency)</li>
  <li>Unposted balance  (Foreign currency)</li>
</ul>

<p>Options common to all browsers in <strong>Everest</strong>  are available in this browser.</p>
