<p>You must load/buy gift card items into <strong>Everest</strong>  before you can sell them. After setting up gift cards as autoserialized  items, you can buy them through the purchase process or by quantity adjustment  in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p class="note">A license is required to process gift cards.  Since a Gift Card license is not a user-based license, only one license  is needed for the entire company. The Gift Card feature is available in  the Sample Company and in evaluation mode.</p>
