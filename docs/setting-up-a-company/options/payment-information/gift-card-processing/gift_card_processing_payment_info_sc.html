<p><strong>Everest</strong> supports  the selling and redemption of Gift Cards. <strong>Everest</strong>  processes gift cards through the payment processor PayBridge. The PayBridge  application acts as an intermediary to process gift card payments between  <strong>Everest</strong> and PCCharge. PCCharge  is the payment processing software that supports many payment networks.  <strong>Everest</strong> allows you to sell and  activate gift cards.</p>
