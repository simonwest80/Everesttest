<p>The main activities involved in gift card processing are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Validating the  gift card number.</li>
  <li>Validating the  card value.</li>
  <li>Obtaining approval  from the financial institution.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must set up gift cards as an item in <strong>Everest</strong>  for selling gift cards.</p>

<p>Prior to setting up the gift card as an Item, you need to  set up a liability account. We recommend a separate liability account  for each type of “Gift Card” if you set up gift cards and promotional  cards or have gift cards through multiple providers.</p>

<p class="note">You will need to open an account with a gift  card provider such as Valutec, a service provider for gift cards.</p>
