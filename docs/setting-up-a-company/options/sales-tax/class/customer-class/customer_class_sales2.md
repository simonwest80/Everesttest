# Customer Class


Use this (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Class &gt; Customer Class**) **** to open the **Customer** profile  and then (path: **Customer Class**  > **Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**)  to create a customer class. You can set up a special tax rule for this  class.


{:.example}
**If you have customers who are exempted from  sales tax due to the type of business they deal in, you can create a class  of customers called "Exempt". You can then create a special  tax rule for this class where the tax is zero. Thus, whenever you select  a customer from this class, the tax code relating to that class will automatically  be selected.**
