# Tax Code Details


Use the **Tax Code** profile (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Taxes &gt; Tax Codes &gt;** **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**) to associate tax components to the  tax code. This in turn determines the percentage of tax to be charged  when the tax code is used on documents.


**Tax Code/Description**
: Use the **Tax Code**  field to enter an appropriate abbreviation for the tax code being defined.  This code identifies the tax code throughout **Everest**,  and cannot be changed once it is defined. The description field displays  a full description of the tax code.


{:.example}
**The 8% sales tax applicable in California  can be created with a tax code, CA800 and a description, <font face="Verdana" class="hcp3">'</font>California 8% Sales Tax<font face="Verdana" class="hcp3">'</font>.**


**Non-taxable**
: Select this option when defining a tax code that  is not taxable such as Out of State sales, sale of Food and Clothing,  and Sales to Government and Re-sellers. Tax components cannot be added  to a tax code that is exempt from tax.
