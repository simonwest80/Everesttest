<h1 id="tax-codes">Tax Codes</h1>

<p>A tax code defines the relationship between different tax components,  and the order in which they are applied. Tax codes may comprise one or  more tax components.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a tax code identifies individual tax components that are  taxed. If a tax component is individually taxable, it needs to appear  as the first tax component associated with the tax code.</p>

<p class="note">You must define a separate tax code for every  item, category and customer class taxed at rates different from the usual  rates.</p>

<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">You must create a 
 tax code for each tax rate. </font>

<p class="example">If you operate from Montana which has a total  of 19 counties/cities and a total of 4 different rates - 5%, 5.25%, 5.5%  and 4.75%, you would need to create four different tax codes: MO500, MO525,  MO550 and MO475.</p>
