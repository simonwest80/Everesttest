# Tax Codes


A tax code defines the relationship between different tax components,  and the order in which they are applied. Tax codes may comprise one or  more tax components.


Furthermore, a tax code identifies individual tax components that are  taxed. If a tax component is individually taxable, it needs to appear  as the first tax component associated with the tax code.


{:.note}
You must define a separate tax code for every  item, category and customer class taxed at rates different from the usual  rates.

 tax code for each tax rate. </font>


{:.example}
If you operate from Montana which has a total  of 19 counties/cities and a total of 4 different rates - 5%, 5.25%, 5.5%  and 4.75%, you would need to create four different tax codes: MO500, MO525,  MO550 and MO475.
