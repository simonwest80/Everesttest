# Unit Price Upto


Enter the special price of an item up to which the special tax rule  is applicable. If the item is sold at a higher price the special tax rate  will not apply.


If the unit price exceeds this amount, the default tax code for that  jurisdiction applies to the entire amount of that item.


{:.example}
**A special tax rule set up exempts all items  with a unit selling price up to $10, from tax. If  the item is sold for a higher price, the default tax code for the logged  in jurisdiction will be applied.**
