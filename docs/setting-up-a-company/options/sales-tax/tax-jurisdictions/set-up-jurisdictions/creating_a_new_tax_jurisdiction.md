# Create a Tax Jurisdiction


{:.steps}
To create a tax jurisdiction, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Jurisdictions**. You will see the **Jurisdictions** browser.
- From the **Jurisdictions** browser, select **Options &gt; New**. You will see the [**Jurisdiction**  profile]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/sales-tax/tax-jurisdictions/set-up-jurisdictions/jurisdiction_profile.html).



{:.note}
You can also create a Tax Jurisdiction from the following:

- An existing  **Jurisdiction** profile by clicking  **Options &gt; New**.
- Any profile/dialog  box that contains the **Jurisdiction**  field by selecting **New** from the  right-click menu options.



You cannot modify the company address in the **Company 
 Creation** Wizard. You have to open **Jurisdiction**  profile (path: **File** >**Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Taxes** > **Jurisdictions**),  to modify the address.
