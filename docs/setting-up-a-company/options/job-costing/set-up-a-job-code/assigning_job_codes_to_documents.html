<p>By assigning job codes to the purchase and sales documents, you can  track the expenses and income generated by the job. Job codes can also  be assigned to manual journals, any item in a sales, purchase, credit  or debit document, and to each line item.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open the related  document (sales or purchase).</li>
  <li>Select a line  item, scroll to the right and click the <strong>Job 
 Code</strong> column.</li>
  <li>Specify the  job code.</li>
</ul>
