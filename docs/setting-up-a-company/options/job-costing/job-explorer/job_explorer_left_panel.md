# Job Explorer - Left Panel


This panel displays the job codes in a tree-view. The tree-view makes  it easier to see the relationship between parent and child job codes.  You can create jobs or modify the existing jobs from the explorer.


To create a job from the explorer, right-click in the left panel and  select **New** > **In 
 New Window** from the menu.


To modify an existing job, select that job in the left panel, right-click  and choose **Edit &gt; In New Window**.  You will see the [**Job 
 Costing**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/job-costing/set-up-a-job-code/the_job_costing_profile.html) profile where you can change the information.
