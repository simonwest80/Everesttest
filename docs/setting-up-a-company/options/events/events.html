<p>Events are a pre-defined list of all significant activities in <strong>Everest</strong>. Events are triggered as a result  of functions accessed by users and user groups.</p>

<p>The list of events in <strong>Everest</strong>  are triggered by activities such as creation of records or transactions,  modification of a record, modification of important fields in records,  printing reports, logging in and logging out.</p>

<p>The list of all the events tracked by <strong>Everest</strong> can be viewed from the <strong>Events</strong> browser. Not only can you  track  the occurrence of an event, but also trigger e-mails when an event occurs.  To trigger an e-mail  on the occurrence of an event, you need to create activities and e-mail  templates and associate it with the event.</p>
