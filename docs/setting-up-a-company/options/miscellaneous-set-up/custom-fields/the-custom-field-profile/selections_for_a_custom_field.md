# Selections for a Custom Field


You can also define values that must be available for each custom field  in the **Character** tab.


{:.example}
You have created a custom field called "Color"  for items. You can create red, blue and yellow as selections for the "Color"  custom field. This will simplify and reduce data entry.


The values defined can also be modified or deleted as required.

To define values for the custom field, do the following:

- In the **Characters** tab of the **Custom****Field** dialog box, right-click  the grid and select **Properties**.  You will see the **Custom** **Field** **Definition****Profile**.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana"> </font>
- From the **Custom Field Definition Profile**, click  the ![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_browse_icon.gif) icon beside the **Possible 
 Values** field. You will see the **Custom****Fields** dialog box. The upper panel  of the **Custom Fields** dialog box  lists existing values if any, for the field.
- Enter the value  being defined in the box below the upper panel, and click **Add**.  The value is added to the upper panel. You can add more values in a similar  way.



{:.note}
To modify an existing value, select the value  in the upper panel, type a new value in the box below and click **Replace**. The selected value gets replaced  with the new value.
