<h1 id="custom-fields">Custom Fields</h1>

<p>Use the custom fields feature to define additional information for any  record as per your requirement. Custom fields can be defined as character  strings, date fields, logical fields, numeric fields or memo fields.</p>

<p class="example">You can use custom fields for executing the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grouping records  in the browser based on the fields defined by you.</li>
  <li>Tracking the  expiration date for items.</li>
  <li>Maintaining  good customer relations by keeping track of customers’ birthdays and sending  them birthday cards.</li>
  <li>Generating  reports that include the custom fields by using the <strong>Print</strong>  option in browsers.</li>
  <li>Creating labels  that contain the custom fields.</li>
  <li>Generating  charts that show details of the custom fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Custom fields are available for item, vendor, customer, user, address  and serial number profiles, contact manager tasks as well as all documents.</p>

<p class="example">In the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile you might want to maintain a record of the customer’s hobby, or  you may want to track a periodic date to review the credit terms and/or  purchase history of the customer.</p>

<p>Custom fields defined in the documents are carried forward to the subsequent  document types as the documents are processed.</p>

<p class="example">Custom fields created in a sales quote will  be copied to the sales order as well as the sales invoice as the document  goes through the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Custom fields created in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile do not carry forward to the document line items. Use the <strong>Sales Document Lines</strong> dialog box – <strong>Custom Fields</strong> tab and the <strong>Purchase 
 Document Lines</strong> dialog box – <strong>Custom 
 Fields</strong> tab (path: sales/sales return/purchase/purchase return document  profile &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Line Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Line 
 Profile</strong> or press <strong>Ctrl</strong> +  <strong>Right Arrow</strong> in any document) to  create line item custom fields for documents.</p>
