<p><strong>Everest</strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2"> allows inventory to be automatically transferred to 
 a stock area when a document is processed.</font></p>

<p class="example">Inventory can be automatically moved into  the Main Stock Area when a Purchase Receipt or Invoice is created, or  inventory can be moved into the Released area when a Sales Invoice is  created.</p>

<p>Stock areas are affected  in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">Inventory is received on a purchase receipt or invoice, 
 or returned on a debit memo.</font>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">Inventory is issued on a sales invoice or received on 
 a credit memo.</font>
  </li>
  <li>
    <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">Inventory is assigned or unassigned on an order.</font>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can specify default stock areas for each of these functions in the  <strong>Stock</strong> <strong>Transfer</strong>  tab of the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; From the <strong>Location/Sub-Locations</strong> browser, double-click on the required record).</p>

<p class="note">The stock area can be changed on each document  at the time of receipt or sale.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2">The Location Profile - Stock 
 Transfer Tab - Purchase Document</font></strong></p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">This profile is used to specify the stock areas to 
 which items should be transferred when a purchase document such as purchase 
 order, purchase receipt, purchase invoice, debit order and debit memo 
 are created and items are received/returned on them.</font>

<p><strong><font color="#000000" class="hcp2">The Location Profile - Stock 
 Transfer Tab - Sales Documents</font></strong></p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">This profile is used to specify the stock areas to 
 which items should be transferred when a sales document such as sales 
 order, sales invoice, credit order and credit memo are created and items 
 are dispatched/returned on them.</font>

<p class="example">If you have indicated CSHIP  (customer shipment expected) as the default stock area when items are  attached to a sales order, <strong>Everest</strong>  will automatically transfer items to CSHIP  whenever a sales order is created and items are assigned to it.</p>
