- **Standard 
 -** Select this option to view menu options and toolbars in the standard  Windows view. This option does not hide infrequently used menus.
- **Enhanced**  - Select this option to display an additional drop-down list, using which  you can customize the toolbar. Otherwise the display is the same as the  'standard' display.
- **Flat**  - Select this option to flatten the appearance of toolbars and menu options  (which appears three-dimensional in the above two options). When you place  the cursor over the toolbar or the menu options, the display color is  different from the normal view.
