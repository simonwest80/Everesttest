# Workstation Settings - Stock Bins


Use the Stock Bins tab to specify a separate stock bin for receipt and  issue of inventoried items on purchase, sales and return documents for  the particular workstation. This option is useful to specify different  default stock bins for each place in which you are located.


{:.example}
If you have locations in Virginia and California,  you can set up the workstations to point to their respective 'Main stock  areas'.


{:.note}
The stock bins that you specify here are applicable  only to the specific workstation and override the default stock areas  settings specified in the **Location** profile **&gt; Stock Transfer** tab **&gt; Purchase/Sales Document** tab.


If you check the **Allow users to access 
 only those stock bins in the logged in location** option in the **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control 
 &gt; General** tab)you can select only those stock bins that belong  to the login location/sub-location in the following sub-tabs.

- [For  Purchase]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/work_station_settings_stock_areas_for_purchase.html)
- [For  Sales]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/work_station_settings_stock_areas_for_sales.html)
- [Auto  Serialize Items/Inventory Adjustments]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/work_station_settings_stock_areas_auto_serialize_items.html)



{:.hint}
You can specify a stock areaâ€™s location in  the **Location Code** field of the  **Stock 
 Area** profile (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Stock Areas &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**, if  the **Stock Level** is "Stock  Area".). You can specify a stock bin's location in the **Location 
 Code** field of the **Stock 
 Bin** profile (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Stock Areas &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**, if  the **Stock Level** is "Bin".).


You must have adequate security rights to select a stock area/bin belonging  to another location.
