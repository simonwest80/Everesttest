# Discontinue a Chart of Account


Everest allows you to temporarily discontinue a chart of account. When  you discontinue a chart of account, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available  for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
You cannot discontinue a chart of account  that:

- has a non-zero balance
- has a detail account  beneath it
- is assigned to a posting  group
- is assigned to a payment  method
- is included in an unposted  journal
- is used in Everest US  Payroll


{:.steps}
To discontinue a chart of account, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; Chart 
 of Accounts**. You will see the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser.
- From the **Chart of Accounts** browser, highlight  the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**. <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">The record that 
 was selected is no </font>longer visible in the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser.
