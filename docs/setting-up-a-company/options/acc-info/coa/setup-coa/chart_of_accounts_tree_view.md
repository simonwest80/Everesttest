# Chart of Accounts - Tree-View


The **Show Treeview** ![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_show_treeview.gif) icon enables you to toggle between the 'normal view' and  'tree-view' of the Chart of Accounts. All options available in the standard  **Chart of Accounts** browser are  also available here.


The left pane of the window displays the hierarchy of the accounts.  The right pane of the window displays the detail accounts that come under  the selected parent account.


To revert to the normal browser view, click the **Hide 
 Treeview** ![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/setup_hide_treeview.gif) icon.


The **Chart of Accounts** browser  (or tree view) displays the current balance of the account in both base  currency and foreign currency.
