# Create an Account


{:.steps}
To create an account, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; Chart 
 of Accounts**. You will see the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser (By default, the tree view is displayed).
- From the **Chart of Accounts** browser, select **Options** > **New 
 &gt; In New Window/In Current Window**. You will see the [**Chart of Accounts** profile]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/acc-info/coa/setup-coa/the_chart_of_accounts_profile.html).



{:.note}
A new Chart of Account may also be set up from the following:

- Any profile  that contains the **Account** field  by selecting **New** from the right-click  menu option.
- An existing  **Chart of Account** profile by clicking  **Options &gt; New**.


If you selected the **Creating your own 
 COA** option for Chart of Accounts while setting up a company (in  the Company Creation Wizard), the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser is blank. When you select **Options 
 &gt; New**, **Everest** prompts  you to create a new account. The first accounts that must be created are  the main accounts for the Financial Categories: **Asset, 
 Liability, Capital, Revenue** and **Expenditure**. The account type will always be **General**,  the **Parent Account Code** field  will be left blank, and the **Level**  will be 1.
