# Parent Account Number


All accounts but the Level 1 account (the first general account) will  have a parent. You can define any number of account levels.


Once a transaction or balance has been posted to the respective parent  account code, the parent reference cannot be changed.


{:.note}
**If you opted to create your own Chart of Accounts  you must first create the parent accounts for: **Asset**,  **Liability**, **Capital**,  **Revenue** and **Expenditure**.  The account type will always be **General**,  the **Parent account number** is not  mentioned, and the **Level** will  be 1.**
