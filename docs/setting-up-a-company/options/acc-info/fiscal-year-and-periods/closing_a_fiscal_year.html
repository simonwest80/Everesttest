<p>A fiscal year can be closed after your company’s accounts are finalized.  The revenue and expense accounts become nil and the net income is transferred  to the <strong>Current Earnings Account</strong>  defined in Preferences (path: <strong>File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Accounts &gt; 
 Other Accounts</strong> tab). Balances of assets and liabilities are carried  forward to the successive fiscal year.</p>

<p>To close a fiscal year, select <strong>Close 
 Year</strong> from <strong>Accounting &gt; Year 
 End</strong>. The Year End options are enabled if your company is registered.</p>
