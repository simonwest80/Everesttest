<p>The financial results of a business have to be reported to diverse groups  such as shareholders, lenders, the government and the stock exchange,  in terms of net income measured for a time period, which is normally a  year. This is known as the fiscal year or the accounting year of the company.</p>

<p>The fiscal year may be a calendar year or any period of twelve months.  In certain situations, the fiscal year of a company may be greater or  lesser than a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>This may happen when a company changes its fiscal year.</p>

<p class="example">A company’s original fiscal year was from April 2000 -  March 2001. If the company wants to adopt the calendar year as its fiscal  year, beginning January 1, 2001, the fiscal year from April 2000 - December  2000 would be less than 12 months.</p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">If the company's fiscal year is January - December 
 2000 and from 2001, it wants to adopt April - March as its fiscal year, 
 the fiscal year 2000 would be extended by 3 months, to March 2001.</font>

<p class="note">The yearly accounting period for the United  States federal government begins on October 1 and ends on the following  September 30.</p>

<p>Fiscal years in <strong>Everest</strong> are  used for the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To identify  the opening balances of assets and liabilities for accounting.</li>
  <li>To close the  accounts and transfer the net income to retained earnings.</li>
</ul>
