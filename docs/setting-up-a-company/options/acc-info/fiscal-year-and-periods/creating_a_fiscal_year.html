<ul>
  <li>When setting  up a company, you need to set up the current fiscal year. New fiscal years  can be set up as and when required.</li>
  <li>When creating  a Fiscal Year, the number of periods plus the start and end dates for  the fiscal year must be entered. The start and end dates for each period  in the fiscal year are then computed automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Once the accounting periods are set up, you  cannot change the start and end dates of the fiscal year. The end dates  for the other periods can, however, be changed.</p>

<p>You can have multiple years open at the same time. Thus, you can edit  last year<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">’</font>s records throughout the current year.</p>

<p class="note">Regardless of when you begin using the system,  the periods for the entire year must be defined. For instance, if you  install <strong>Everest</strong> in June for a  calendar year company, the periods from January to May for the year will  still have to be defined. However, detailed information regarding these  periods need not be entered; only the necessary opening account balances  for each period would suffice.</p>
