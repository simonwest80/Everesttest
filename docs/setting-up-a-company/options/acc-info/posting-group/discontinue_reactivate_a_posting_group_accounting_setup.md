# Discontinue/Reactivate a Posting Group


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue a Posting Group. When a Posting Group is discontinued, it  is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated. This browser  displays all the discontinued Posting Groups. A discontinued Posting Group  can be made available for selection by activating it again from this browser.  You can reactivate a Posting Group either by selecting **Activate**  from the **Options** menu or pressing  **Enter**.


A Posting Group that is assigned to a master cannot be discontinued.  You must first disassociate the Posting Group from the master and then  proceed to discontinue it. The [List  Assigned Masters]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/assigned_masters_browser_posting_group_brow_setup_comp.html) browser (path: **Posting 
 Groups** browser > **Options**  > **List Assigned Masters**) displays  all the masters to which a Posting Group is assigned.
