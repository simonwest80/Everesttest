# Modify a Posting Group


You can modify any field in the **Posting 
 Group** profile provided you have adequate security rights. A **Posting Group** profile can be modified  from any one of the following locations:

- The **Posting 
 Groups** browser - Highlight the record in the browser and select  **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window**.
- The **Posting 
 Groups** profile - Specify the code of the required Posting Group  in the **Code** field.



An additional option Rename the Posting Group ID is available from the  **Posting Groups** browser as well  as the **Posting Group** profile.  Unlike other profiles in Everest, where you are not allowed to modify  the code, you can use the Rename the Posting Group ID option to edit the  code of the Posting Group.


{:.note}
Any changes to the Posting Group will apply  to the new transactions only; existing transactions where the respective  Posting Group is used are not affected.
