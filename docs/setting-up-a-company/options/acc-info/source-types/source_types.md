Debit and credit entries are automatically generated when system processes  that affect accounting, such as creating a sales invoice or payment collection  are carried out. Each of these entries is identified using an identifier  called a **Source Type**. Source types  also have to be identified while creating manual entries.


Identifying the source of entries becomes useful for audit purposes.  Source types also help identify the origin of an entry when reviewing  reports such as the Activity report.


User defined source types can also be created as needed for use in manual  entries.


System source types identify all system-generated entries. System source  types can be categorized as the following:

- [Purchase  transactions source types]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/system_source_types_-_purchasing_transactions.html)
- [Invoicing  transactions source types]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/system_source_types_-_invoicing_transactions.html)
- [Miscellaneous  source types]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/system_source_types_-_miscellaneous_transactions.html)
