# Country Setup


Use the **Country** profile (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; 
 Country** > **Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window**) to specify the formats for telephones (land  lines, mobile numbers and fax lines) and zip codes/postal codes for countries.  The display of information is standardized, since users are allowed to  enter only the characters specified in the mask for the country. By default,  **Everest** provides a list of all  the countries in the **Countries**  browser. You must set up the country information such as the telephone  and zip code format for each country.


{:.example}
**If you are located in the United States, you  can specify the telephone format as 000-000-0000. In any profile, you  must enter the telephone number in the specified format. Thus, inconsistent  characters will not be entered.**


You may specify the format for telephones and zip codes for the countries  in which you operate as well as the countries in which your customers/vendors  reside.


All profiles where telephone numbers and zip codes are specified contain  the **Apply Mask** check boxes. To  apply the format specified in the **Country** profile, select the **Apply Mask** check boxes in the respective profile.


By default, the **Apply Mask** check  box is selected. Clear this check box to enter the telephone numbers and  zip/postal codes in any format that you desire.
