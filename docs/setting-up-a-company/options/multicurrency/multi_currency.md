# Multicurrency


With increasing globalization,  business, trade and commerce are no longer restricted to national boundaries  or a single currency. The international operations of a company could  take any of these forms:

- Sales in a  foreign currency
- Purchases in  a foreign currency
- Maintaining  bank accounts in a different country
- Foreign currency  investments
- Sales and purchase  of other assets/liabilities in a foreign currency
- Other receipts  such as dividends and interest in a foreign currency
- Other payments  such as dividends/interest in a foreign currency
- Foreign exchange  transactions such as swap options and arbitrage



All foreign currency transactions must be accounted for in the base  currency (also known as the home currency or functional currency) by using  the relevant exchange rate. The base currency is the currency of the country  in which your company is headquartered  and hence the currency that you will use for accounting purposes.


Use the **Everest** multicurrency  module to handle all foreign currency transactions that take place in  the course of international trade and commerce.
