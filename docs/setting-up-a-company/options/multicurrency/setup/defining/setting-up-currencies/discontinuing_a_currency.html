<p>When you discontinue a record, it is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued record can be 
 made available for selection by activating it again.</font></p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides a global list  of currencies using ISO codes. Currencies that are not in use can be discontinued.  Discontinuing a currency does not affect documents or journals already  created with that currency.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a currency, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Multicurrency 
 &gt; Currency</strong>. You will see the <strong>Currencies</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Currencies</strong> browser, highlight the record.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will be  prompted for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">The selected 
 record that was selected is no </font>longer visible in the <strong>Currencies</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
