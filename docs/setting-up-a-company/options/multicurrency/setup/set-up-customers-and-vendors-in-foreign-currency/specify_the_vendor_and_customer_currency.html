<p>If you have foreign currency dealings with vendors, you have to specify  the currency in which you want to deal. This is specified in the <strong>Currency</strong> <strong>Code</strong>  field of the <strong>Vendor</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Purchasing &gt; Vendors &gt;</strong> <strong>Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Multicurrency</strong> tab).</p>

<p>Thereafter, all transactions with the vendor will be in the currency  specified. You will not be allowed to transact with them in any other  currency.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>You can set up the currency for a vendor only  at the time of creation of the account. Once the **Vendor</strong>  profile is saved, you cannot change the <strong>Currency 
 Code</strong>.**</p>
