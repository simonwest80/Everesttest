# Specifying Customer Currency


If you have foreign currency dealings with customers, you have to specify  the currency in which you want to deal with them. This is specified in  the **Customer** profile (path: **Invoicing &gt; Customers &gt;** **Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Accounting** tab).


Thereafter, all transactions with the customer will be in the foreign  currency specified. You will not be allowed to transact with them in any  other currency.


{:.note}
**You can set up the currency for a customer  only at the time of creation of the account. Once the **Customer**  profile has been saved, you can no longer change the **Currency 
 Code**.**
