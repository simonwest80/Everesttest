<p><strong>Implications of setting up an account in a foreign  currency</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>While reconciling  an account that has been set up in a foreign currency, the amounts are  displayed in the foreign currency and not in the base currency. This is  to facilitate easier reconciliation since the bank statements will be  furnished in the foreign currency.</li>
  <li>You can view  the balance information for the account in both, the foreign and the base  currencies. The foreign currency balance is displayed in the <strong>Chart 
 of Accounts</strong> browser (path: <strong>Accounting 
 &gt; Chart of Accounts</strong>). To view the balance in base currency,  double-click the required account in the <strong>Chart 
 of Accounts</strong> browser and select the <strong>Accounting</strong>  tab.</li>
  <li>When this account  is retrieved in a journal the foreign currency specified is automatically  displayed in the journal.</li>
</ul>
