You must define the exchange rates for all foreign currencies that you  transact in. You can define as many exchange rates as you want on the  same day. When you create a transaction/document using the currency, the  latest exchange rate for the currency is displayed. Exchange rates can  be changed for individual transactions.


{:.note}
**The exchange rate set up is the default rate  for buying/selling. You can modify the rate at the document or transaction  level.**
