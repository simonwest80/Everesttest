<p>The buy and sell rates are expressed in terms of the quote type and  quote quantity for the foreign currency, as set up in the <strong>Foreign 
 Currency</strong> profile.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>Your base currency is the US Dollar (USD)  and the foreign currency is the Japanese Yen (JPY). You have set up the  quote type in the JPY profile as **Foreign 
 to Base</strong> with the quote quantity as 100. If the rate  for 1 JPY = 0.00872, the rate you must enter in the profile must be 0.872  for 100 JPY.**</p>
