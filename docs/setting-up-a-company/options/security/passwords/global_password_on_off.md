# Global Password On/Off


Because of **Everest**<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana">â€™</font>s elaborate security layer, users are required  to enter their user ID and password for each function.


Entering the password repeatedly can be tedious, but is a valuable safeguard  for data when multiple users use the same computer or when the system  is not in a secure location. However, in some cases, the extra effort  of repeatedly entering the user ID and password can be a detriment to  the user efficiency. For this reason, **Everest**  has the **Global Password** option.


When this option is toggled **ON**,  the user can perform all the functions for which access has been granted,  without having to enter the password again.


If the user attempts to perform a function for which no access rights  have been given, the user is prompted for a user name and password with  adequate rights. Only a user with the requisite rights can enter this  domain. This feature helps a manager to allow temporary access to a particular  function.


When **Everest** is first installed,  the Global Password option is **ON**.
