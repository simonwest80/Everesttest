<p>A unique feature of <strong>Everest</strong>  is the ability to embed passwords. When entering a password, the user  can type the actual password string at the beginning, end or in the middle  of a cluster of up to 40 characters. This feature is useful in concealing  the password from others. Also, if you type the password incorrectly,  you do not have to delete the typing; you can simply retype the password.</p>

<p class="example">A user’s password is PLAIN. If you wish to maintain secrecy, you can  disguise your password in any of the following ways:</p>

<p>PLAIN WHITE ENVELOPE</p>

<p>THE PLAIN IN SPAIN</p>

<p>EXPLAIN</p>

<p>The character string PLAIN in these examples is recognized and accepted.</p>
