# Passwords


**Everest** uses a multi-level encrypted  password system for all critical areas and tasks to provide complete data  protection.


Encrypting is a security method used to encode the password by applying  an algorithm to plain text to change it to ciphertext.


Passwords can be changed by the user or by the system supervisor (or  anyone with equivalent rights) as needed.
