<p>Use the <strong>Security Rights</strong> browser  to specify the users who must have a particular right or to view the users  assigned to an individual security right. You can assign a security right  to multiple users at the same time. You can also assign security rights  to groups and view the groups assigned to a specific security right from  this browser.</p>

<p class="note">An audit trail is created in the <strong>Everest 
 Event History</strong> browser every time a particular user’s credentials  are overridden by a user with more access privileges. This information  can assist with determining additional rights needed by a user.</p>
