<p>Security rights are categorized based on the function to which they  are related and by the user interfaces in which they come into play.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>The security right ‘Customer: Add’ is categorized  in the Invoicing section under Profiles; the security right ‘Customer  Browser: Print’ is categorized in the Invoicing section under Browsers.</strong></p>

<p>You can view security rights either by their functional or user interface  category.</p>
