# Categorization of Security Rights


Security rights are categorized based on the function to which they  are related and by the user interfaces in which they come into play.


{:.example}
**The security right 'Customer: Add' is categorized  in the Invoicing section under Profiles; the security right 'Customer  Browser: Print' is categorized in the Invoicing section under Browsers.**


You can view security rights either by their functional or user interface  category.
