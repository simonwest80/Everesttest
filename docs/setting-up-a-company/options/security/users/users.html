<p>All persons who have been given rights to log in to <strong>Everest</strong>  are known as users. When a company is created, two user codes are created  by default, Supervisor (SUP) and Guest (GST).  Additional users can be defined as required. Users with similar rights  can be grouped together and assigned group security rights. When setting  up your company, make sure you add each individual user.</p>

<p>The user database can also double up as your employee database as most  users are likely to be employees.</p>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp1 note">You may want to create people who are not employees 
 as users with limited access rights.</font>

<font color="#000000" class="hcp1 example">Consultants hired from contractors, the audit clerks 
 of your CPA, or the auditor.</font>
