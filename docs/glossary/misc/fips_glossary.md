**FIPS**


The FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) code is a 10-digit  numeric code comprising the 2-digit state code, 3-digit county code and  3-digit city/town code. FIPS codes are applicable only in the United States.  Corroborating the Zip Codes, the FIPS codes are used for greater accuracy  in identifying the Tax Jurisdiction for a city/state/county in the United  States.
