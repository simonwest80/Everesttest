**Bar Codes**


An identification code printed as a set of vertical bars of differing widths. Used for rapid, error-free input, bar codes represent binary information that can be read by an optical scanner. The coding can include numbers, letters, or a combination of the two; some codes include built-in error checking method and can be read in either direction.
