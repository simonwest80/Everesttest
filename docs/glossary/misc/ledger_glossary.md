**Ledger**


The book of accounts in which all journal entries are posted. Two types of ledgers exist: (1) The detail ledger that includes transaction entries for each separate asset, liability, equity, income and expense account and subsequently leads to the trial balance and financial statements, and (2) the general ledger that includes summary totals by journal for each chart of account.
