**Final Documents**


They are the documents that are created to record the completion of  a purchase, purchase return, sales or sales return. Purchase invoices,  debit memos, sales invoices, credit memos, point-of-sale invoices and  point-of-sale credit memos are final documents. When any of these documents  is created, **Everest** also generates  the accounting entries required in a sales or purchase journal.
