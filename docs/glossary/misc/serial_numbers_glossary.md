**Serial Number**


Individual units of inventory are tracked using either a manufacturer's serial number or an internal serial number generated by **Everest**, when they are purchased. The serial number helps identify an item and retrieve vital information such as cost, purchase date, vendor, sales date, customer and maintain a complete audit trail of movements of the unit.
