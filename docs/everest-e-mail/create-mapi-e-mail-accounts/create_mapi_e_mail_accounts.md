# Create MAPI E-mail Accounts


MAPI is an acronym for Messaging Application Programming Interface.


Having a standard library of messaging functions allows Windows application  developers to take advantage of the Windows messaging subsystem, supported  by default with Microsoft Mail or Microsoft Exchange. By writing to the  generic MAPI interface, any Windows application can become "mail-enabled".  Since MAPI standardizes the way messages are handled by mail-enabled applications,  each of the applications does not have to include vendor-specific code  for each target messaging system.


A MAPI server handles the receipt, transmission and storage of messages.
