# Check for New Messages


**Everest E-Mail** scans your POP3  and MAPI accounts periodically and loads new messages on to **Everest 
 E-Mail** inbox. The time interval at which it checks for new messages  depends on how you have configured **Everest 
 E-Mail**.


{:.note}
**Everest E-Mail** scans only the  Inbox on the mail server for new mails. If the Inbox contains mails that  are already marked as 'read', these mails are not downloaded. Only new,  unread mails are downloaded.


**Everest E-Mail** copies these  unread mails into **Everest**, and  marks the mails on the server as 'read'. Thus if you use MS Outlook or  any other e-mail client, mails downloaded by **Everest 
 E-Mail** appear as read.


{:.steps}
To check for new messages, do the following:

- From the **Folder List** in the **Everest E-Mail** main window, select **Inbox**.
- From the **Everest E-Mail** menu, select **Tools**  > **Send**/**Receive 
 All**. **Everest E-Mail** checks  for new messages and delivers outgoing messages to recipients.



{:.note}
Whenever a new message is received in the  **Everest E-Mail** Inbox, it is also  reflected in the **My E-mail** and  **All E-mail** browsers.
