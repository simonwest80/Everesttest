# Spell Check 


It is a good business practice to spell check your e-mail  messages before you send them to your business associates. E-mail messages  in **Everest** are enabled with a  live spelling feature. As you type a word, the word is underlined with  a red line if the spelling is incorrect. Right-click on the word and select  the correct word from the suggested options to correct the spelling. You  can also check the spelling using the procedure below.


{:.steps}
To spell check your Everest e-mail messages,  do the following:

- From the **Everest E-Mail** menu, select **Options**  > **Spell Check** or simply press  the **F7** key. If your e-mail contains  words not found in the dictionary, the **Spelling**  dialog box displays with standard spell checking options.
