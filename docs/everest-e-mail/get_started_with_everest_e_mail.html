<p>The ability to send messages and files has become increasingly important  in a business environment. Electronic mail is cheaper and faster than  conventional mails, less intrusive than a phone call and more convenient  than a fax. With electronic mail, differences in location and time zone  are less of an obstacle to communication. <strong>Everest 
 E-Mail</strong> has many important and useful features that enable you to  effortlessly communicate with users, vendors and customers.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> <strong>E-Mail</strong>  is a messaging client built within <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Edition</strong> to help you organize and share information on  your desktop and communicate with other people over a network. You can  send and receive e-mails from any computer connected to the World Wide  Web.</p>

<p>When you set up <strong>Everest</strong> <strong>E-Mail,</strong> the application looks for your  user profile. If you do not have a user profile, you need to create one.  If you plan to use the e-mail features in <strong>Everest 
 E-Mail</strong>, you must add the appropriate account information to your  user profile.</p>

<p>A user profile defines how your <strong>Everest 
 E-Mail</strong> is <em>**</em> set up for a  user.</p>

<p>If you have an existing user profile with the information services and  settings recommended by your administrator, you can get started right  away.</p>

<p class="example">Your user profile might specify that you send  and receive messages with an Internet connection<strong>.</strong></p>

<p class="note">If you work in a corporate LAN environment,  it is advisable to use <strong>Everest E-Mail</strong>  with the settings recommended by your network administrator<strong>.</strong></p>
