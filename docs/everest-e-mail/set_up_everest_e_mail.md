# Set Up Everest E-Mail


When you set up **Everest E-Mail**,  you need to determine the e-mail configuration that suits your needs.


Create Everest E-Mail Accounts


A mail account is a group of settings that defines how **Everest** **E-Mail** is set up  for a particular user.


**Everest** **E**-**Mail** can use either dial-up Internet  service, corporate e-mail servers, or both. You can create both POP3 and  MAPI e-mail accounts in **Everest E-Mail**.


If you use a modem to establish a dial-up connection to an Internet  service provider, and you are not connected to a server by LAN, you need  to configure **Everest E-Mail** to  use POP3/SMTP  access.


If your computer is on a LAN with a mail server such as Microsoft Exchange  Server, select the MAPI option. By using the Internet e-mail service provider,  you can also use Internet service providers that offer access using the  POP3/SMTP protocol.


{:.note}
If you need to work with a different set of  information services, it may be useful to create additional mail accounts.  If more than one person uses the same computer, each person should have  a separate mail account.
