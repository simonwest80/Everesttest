<h1 id="set-up-everest-e-mail">Set Up Everest E-Mail</h1>

<p>When you set up <strong>Everest E-Mail</strong>,  you need to determine the e-mail configuration that suits your needs.</p>

<p>Create Everest E-Mail Accounts</p>

<p>A mail account is a group of settings that defines how <strong>Everest</strong> <strong>E-Mail</strong> is set up  for a particular user.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> <strong>E</strong>-<strong>Mail</strong> can use either dial-up Internet  service, corporate e-mail servers, or both. You can create both POP3 and  MAPI e-mail accounts in <strong>Everest E-Mail</strong>.</p>

<p>If you use a modem to establish a dial-up connection to an Internet  service provider, and you are not connected to a server by LAN, you need  to configure <strong>Everest E-Mail</strong> to  use POP3/SMTP  access.</p>

<p>If your computer is on a LAN with a mail server such as Microsoft Exchange  Server, select the MAPI option. By using the Internet e-mail service provider,  you can also use Internet service providers that offer access using the  POP3/SMTP protocol.</p>

<p class="note">If you need to work with a different set of  information services, it may be useful to create additional mail accounts.  If more than one person uses the same computer, each person should have  a separate mail account.</p>
