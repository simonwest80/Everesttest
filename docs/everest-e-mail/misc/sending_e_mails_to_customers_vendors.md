# Sending E-mails to Customers/Vendors

 Send** to send the mail.



{:.note}
You can also send e-mails to **Everest**  users from the **Users** tab of the  **Address Book** dialog box.


If an e-mail address is common to both customer and vendor, the mails  sent or received are classified as either a customer or a vendor, but  not as both. The respective browsers display the details in the [**My E-mail**]({{site.eml_baseurl}}/misc/my_e_mail_browser.html) or [**All E-mail**]({{site.eml_baseurl}}/misc/all_e_mail_browser.html) browser. The **Type**  column in the **Everest E-Mail** window  shows either a Customer or Vendor.


{:.note}
By default, **Everest 
 E-Mail** classifies the type as customer in such cases.
