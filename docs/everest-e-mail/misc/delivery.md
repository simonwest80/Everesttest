: Check this option, if you wish to leave a copy of  the messages on the mail server, after **Everest 
 E-mail** downloads the mail to your mailbox.

You may not be able to recover some messages  because the period for which mails are stored on the server is set by  your administrator.


**Remove from server when deleted from ‘Deleted  Items'**
: Check this option to permanently delete messages  from the **Everest** database and  the mail server.
: To enable this option, you must select the **Leave a copy of message on server** check  box.
: If you do not select the **Remove 
 from server when deleted from ‘Deleted Items'** check box, the messages  deleted from the ‘Deleted Items’ folder are stored in the mail server;  however, they are not displayed in any folder on the **Everest 
 E-mail** window.
: It is recommended that you select the option to  avoid the likelihood of deleted messages being downloaded from the mail  server into the inbox.


**Get headers only**
: E-mail headers provide you with information such  as, the route a message took to reach your e-mail account, origin of the  message, what e-mail client was used to send it, etc. Check this option  to enable headers to be part of the message sent or received.
