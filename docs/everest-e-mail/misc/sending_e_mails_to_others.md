# Sending E-mails to Others


To send e-mails to entities other than customers/vendors/users using  **Everest E-Mail**, you need to have  a POP3 or MAPI account created.


{:.steps}
To send e-mails to others, do the following:

- Select the  POP3 or MAPI account name in the **Folder 
 List**.
- Then select  **File** > **New**  > **New** **Message**  from the **Everest E-Mail** menu.  You will see the new message window.
- From the new  message window, click the **To** button.  You will see the **Address Book**  dialog box.



{:.note}
For a MAPI account, apart from the Users,  Customers and Vendors tab, the **Address 
 Book** dialog box will have an **&lt;Account 
 Name&gt;** tab for storing your personal contact list.

- Select the  contact to whom you want to send the mail from the <**Account 
 Name**> tab. Add your selections to the **To**,  **Cc**, or **Bcc**  fields and click **OK**. You will  see the names in the corresponding fields of the new message window.
- Enter the subject  and body of the message. Click **File &gt; 
 Send** to send the mail.
