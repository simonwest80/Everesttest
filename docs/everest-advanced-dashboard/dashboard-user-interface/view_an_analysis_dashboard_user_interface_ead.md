# View an Analysis


A web part **Analysis** is simply  a pivot table view of a web part. The **Analysis**  web part displays a list of preset analyses or examinations of a portion  of the data mart data. The analyses listed may not be shown as a web part  on the dashboard. The System Administrator or other authorized users can  add a seasonal analysis that you only use part of the year.
