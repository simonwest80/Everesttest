# Filter the Dashboard Web Parts


Use the **Filter** web part to view  or change the web part information filter for the entire dashboard. It  is important to know how the filter is used so that you can easily make  adjustments to your dashboard as needed.

**The Filter Web Part**


Items that can be filtered are shown below the **Filter**  web part name with down arrows after them. Underneath the items that can  be filtered, the filter setting is shown.  In  this example, the **Location** filter  item is showing **All Location**.  This means that data for all locations is being shown on the dashboard  but the Location can be filtered further.

**The Filter Web Part Filtered for Location**


{:.example}
If you do not want your dashboard web parts  to show sales data from all locations, click the down arrow following  **Location**, click the plus sign  to expand **All Location**, and select  **Global Headquarters – United States**  from the list.


{:.example}
You go to the **Filter**  web part and set the filter to one sales representative, for one category,  in one period.  The  web part table refreshes and the sales figures displayed now show the  selected sales representative, category, and time period.
