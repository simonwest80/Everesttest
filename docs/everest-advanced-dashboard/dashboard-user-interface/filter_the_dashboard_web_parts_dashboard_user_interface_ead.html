<p>Use the <strong>Filter</strong> web part to view  or change the web part information filter for the entire dashboard. It  is important to know how the filter is used so that you can easily make  adjustments to your dashboard as needed.</p>

<p><strong>The Filter Web Part</strong></p>

<p>Items that can be filtered are shown below the <strong>Filter</strong>  web part name with down arrows after them. Underneath the items that can  be filtered, the filter setting is shown.  In  this example, the <strong>Location</strong> filter  item is showing <strong>All Location</strong>.  This means that data for all locations is being shown on the dashboard  but the Location can be filtered further.</p>

<p class="steps">To filter the Everest Advanced Dashboard,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>Filter</strong>  web part, click the down <img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/dashboard down arrow.gif" alt="" /> arrow following the filter item  that you would like to change.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Filter Web Part with the Down Arrow Selected</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the plus  sign in front of the filter item displayed to expand the list of choices.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Filter Web Part with Filter Item Expanded</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click the item  in the list to be used for the filter. The item is added below the filter  item on the <strong>Filter</strong> web part. All  of the web parts on the dashboard now show data filtered as in the <strong>Filter</strong> web part.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/the filter web part filtered by location.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>The Filter Web Part Filtered for Location</strong></p>

<p class="example">If you do not want your dashboard web parts  to show sales data from all locations, click the down arrow following  <strong>Location</strong>, click the plus sign  to expand <strong>All Location</strong>, and select  <strong>Global Headquarters – United States</strong>  from the list.</p>

<p class="example">You go to the <strong>Filter</strong>  web part and set the filter to one sales representative, for one category,  in one period.  The  web part table refreshes and the sales figures displayed now show the  selected sales representative, category, and time period.</p>
