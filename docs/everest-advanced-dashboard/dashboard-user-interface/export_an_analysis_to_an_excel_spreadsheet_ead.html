<p>Use the <strong>Export</strong> feature inside  of a pivot table analysis to export the analysis to an Excel Spreadsheet  if you need the data mart information in this format. Realize that the  data you send to Excel is not updated periodically as it is on the dashboard.  Instead, it gives you information captured from the dashboard at a particular  point in time. Changes made to the data in the data mart can cause the  information to change.</p>

<p class="steps">To export an Analysis to an Excel Spreadsheet,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From within a pivot  table analysis, on the menu bar, select <strong>File 
 &gt; Export to Excel</strong>.</li>
</ul>
