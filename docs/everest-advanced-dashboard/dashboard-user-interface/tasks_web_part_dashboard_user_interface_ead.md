# Tasks Web Part


When you log in to **Everest**,  you can use the **Tasks** web part  to view a list of your **Everest**  tasks.  The  information from this web part comes from **Everest**,  not the Data Warehouse, so you can edit and add new tasks. You can also  change the way your tasks are displayed on your Tasks web part.

Change the Display of your Tasks


Use the **Modify My Web Part** option  to sort and change how your tasks are displayed.


{:.steps}
To change the display of your tasks in the  Tasks web part, do the following:

- Verify that you  are looking at a personal view of your **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard**. In the personal view, **Modify 
 My Page** is displayed at the top right corner of the dashboard.   If you  are not looking at a personal view, follow the steps in the [Modify  My Page Menu Options]({{site.db_baseurl}}/dashboard-user-interface/modify_my_page_menu_options_ead.html) section to do this.


- On the **Tasks**  web part, click the down arrow to the right of the web part.
- Select **Modify 
 My Web Part**. A dotted line is displayed around the web part indicating  that it is in edit mode and a **Tasks**  dialog box is displayed.
- Click the plus  sign in front of **Everest** to expand  the options available.
