<p><strong>Web Part</strong></p>

<p>Your <strong>Everest</strong> dashboard can contain  the following Web Parts depending upon your dashboard configuration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tasks</strong>  – Displays a list of tasks for the logged in user of <strong>Everest</strong>.  <strong>Everest</strong> transactional data is  presented, not data from the Data Warehouse. If the dashboard is displayed  within the <strong>Everest</strong> desktop, click  the task name link to open that task in Edit mode.  Click  <strong>Add New Task</strong> to open the <strong>Task</strong> profile in New mode.  The  following properties are also available:</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sort</strong> –  You can toggle the list between sort by due date then priority or sort  by priority then due date</li>
  <li><strong>Completed Task</strong>  – You can define if the web part includes completed tasks</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Show Status</strong>  – You can define if the <strong>Status</strong>  and <strong>% Complete</strong> columns are visible.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Calendar 
 Events</strong> – Displays a list of appointments for the logged in user  of Everest.  This  information from this web part comes from Everest, not the Data Warehouse,  so you can view appointments linked to accounts or documents. The calendar  event list displays visual reminders of overdue appointments, appointments  containing reminders, and appointments linked to accounts or documents.  If the dashboard is displayed within the Everest desktop, a link is provided  to add a new calendar event. Click on the subject link in the calendar  event list to open an Everest event in Edit mode.</li>
  <li><strong>Sales 
 Snapshots</strong> – The Everest Advanced Dashboard provides a variety of  sales web parts which present sales information from different perspectives.</li>
  <li><strong>Filter</strong>  – A Filter web part can be connected to a web part, such as a Sales web  part.  The  totals displayed in that web part can change depending upon the selections  made in the filter. This is a very powerful option that can be used to  help you drill down more into the data details.</li>
  <li><strong>Analysis</strong>  – The Analysis web part displays a list of preset analyses or examinations  of a portion of the data mart data. Click an analysis item to get detailed  information on that item. After you open a listed analysis, you are not  limited to viewing only the pivot table information initially displayed.  Contact your System Administrator to set up an Analysis web part if you  do not have this feature on your dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Weather</strong>  – Displays the current weather conditions in your local area. You can  change the location to see the current weather conditions in other areas.</li>
</ul>
