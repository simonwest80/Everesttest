<p>You can change the filters within the pivot table to view more data  and to further refine the data displayed. Use this powerful feature if  you need to see more data than the web part pivot table contains. Once  you access the data behind the web parts, you can expand your view to  see all of the data in the data mart. You do not have to move fields in  the row or column areas to do this.</p>

<p>To further understand this concept, think of a car analogy. The “dashboard”,  including its web parts, displays information about what is going on inside  the vehicle. Opening the pivot table is like going under the hood of the  car to view all of the parts from underneath. Once you are under the hood  of the car, you can view information about all of the parts from many  different angles and perspectives. Similarly, the high level of detail  that you can obtain from a data mart by looking at the pivot tables is  very impressive.</p>

<p class="example">In the Net Sales This Year VS Last Year web  part example, the net sales are filtered by a selected location. Change  the filter to view either more, less, or different locations.</p>

<p>To change the pivot table filter to view <strong>More</strong>  information, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your pivot table,  click the down arrow to the right of a filter name in the filter area  to see the filter settings available. (If you do not have a filter in  the filter area, drag and drop a field from the <strong>Pivot 
 Table Field List</strong> onto the filter area.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Filter Drop-down List Showing Filter Settings  Available</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Select additional  filter items. In this example, to view more information, we can select  additional locations/sub-locations or select <strong>All</strong>  locations/sub-locations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">A gray box with a check mark inside it  means  that some of the contents are selected. Expand the items by clicking the  plus signs  to  view the exact contents. A white box with a check mark inside it  means  that the entire item is selected.</p>

<p><strong>Location Sub Location Filter Settings Showing  All Locations</strong></p>

<p class="example">To view more locations than Online Web (CA  and WY), change the pivot table filter to display all locations/sub-locations.  Select the <strong>All</strong> check box. The  rest of the check boxes are selected automatically.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>  to change the pivot table filter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Location Sub Location Filter Showing All Locations</strong></p>

<p>In this example, the Location Sub Location filter has changed from Online  Web (CA and WY) to All Locations. Notice that the sales figures are higher  than they were when filtered on only one location.</p>
