# Calendar Events Web Part


The **Calendar Events** web part  displays a list of appointments for the logged in user of **Everest**.  The information from this web part comes from **Everest**,  not the Data Warehouse, so you can view appointments linked to accounts  or documents. The calendar event list displays visual reminders of overdue  appointments, appointments containing reminders, and appointments linked  to accounts or documents.
