<p>Use the Field List to add fields to pivot tables to “drill down”, “slice”,  and “dice” into the data to get additional information. The following  figure shows the pivot table for a Sales Table web part. While you can  see sales information for each of your customers, you can access much  more details than are being displayed.</p>

<p class="note">This is not a complete discussion of Pivot  Table Services. The procedures here are only intended as tips to get you  started using your <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>.  For more information, see Microsoft’s web site, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/ead pivot table areas.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Pivot Table Areas</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Filter Area</strong></dt>

  <dt><strong>Column Area</strong></dt>
  <dd>Add a field to this area to add a field to the x-axis  of your report.</dd>

<p>Add Fields to a Web Part Filter Table</p>

<p class="steps">To add filter fields to a web part pivot  table, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the pivot  table menu bar, select <strong>View &gt; Field 
 List</strong>. The <strong>Pivot Table Field List</strong>  dialog box is displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/pivot table field list dialog box.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>Pivot Table Field List Dialog Box</strong></p>

<p>Bolded fields in the <strong>Pivot Table Field</strong>  dialog box are currently in the pivot table. Fields that are not bolded  are available to be added to the pivot table.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Drag and drop fields  from the <strong>Pivot Table Field List</strong>  dialog box to the pivot table in the areas indicated in the pivot table.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/dashboard pivot table media field added to pivot table.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>Drag and Drop the Media Type Field to the Pivot  Table</strong></p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-advanced-dashboard/img/dashboard pivot table showing media type data.gif" alt="" /></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Media Type Field added to the Pivot Table</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Scroll to view  the additional information for the fields in the pivot table or maximize  the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">After adding the <strong>Media 
 Type</strong> field to the pivot table, the sales per customer is now broken  down by sales per media type per customer. You can see how much of the  store sales for customer Wildon Cameron resulted from In-Store Coupons.  More importantly, you can see which media types are most effective for  each of your customers.</p>

<p class="note">For best results, limit your field additions  to one or two fields per axis at a time.</p>
