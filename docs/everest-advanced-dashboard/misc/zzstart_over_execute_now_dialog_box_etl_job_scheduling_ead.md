title: Start Over
---


Use the **Start Over** option to  delete and rebuild the data mart. This completely refreshes the data mart  and retrieves data from the oldest **Everest**  data available. The data mart cubes will also be reprocessed.


{:.warn}
The **Start 
 Over** option overwrites all records in the data mart and may take  a very long time to execute.
