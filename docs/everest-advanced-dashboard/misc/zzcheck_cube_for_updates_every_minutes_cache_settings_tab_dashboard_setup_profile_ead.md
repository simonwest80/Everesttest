title: Check cube for updates every ____ minutes
---


Enter the number of minutes to wait to check if the cube has been refreshed.  If the cube has been updated, the cache expires. When a request is made  to refresh the dashboard web page and the cube has been updated, the web  part queries the cube for a new result set since the cache is expired.  Set this option to a low number, especially if you run your ETL frequently.
