<p>If you select <strong>Choose Date</strong>, the  <strong>Date</strong> field appears. In the <strong>Date</strong> field, select an arbitrary date  and <strong>Everest</strong> will extract records  back to the chosen date. If you choose a date that is before the date  of the last successfully loaded record, the previously collected data  in the data mart will be overwritten. This option may take longer than  a normal ETL run.</p>
