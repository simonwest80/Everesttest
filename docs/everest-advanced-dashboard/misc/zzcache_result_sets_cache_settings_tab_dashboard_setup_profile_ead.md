title: Cache Result Sets
---


To maximize performance, select Cache Results Sets to turn caching on.  If you run your ETL every 5 minutes or less, deselect Cache Result Sets  to turn caching off. We recommend that you use caching where possible  due to the dramatic performance benefits. You can retrieve result sets  much faster from the cache than from the data source.
