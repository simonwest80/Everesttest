If you select **Choose Date**, the  **Date** field appears. In the **Date** field, select an arbitrary date  and **Everest** will extract records  back to the chosen date. If you choose a date that is before the date  of the last successfully loaded record, the previously collected data  in the data mart will be overwritten. This option may take longer than  a normal ETL run.
