title: Choose Date
---


Use the **Choose Date** option to  choose an arbitrary date and **Everest**  will extract records back to the chosen date. If you choose a date that  is before the date of the last successfully loaded record, the previously  collected data in the data mart will be overwritten. This option may take  longer than a normal ETL run.
