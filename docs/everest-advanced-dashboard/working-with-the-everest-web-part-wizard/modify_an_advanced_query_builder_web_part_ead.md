# Modify an Advanced Query Builder Web Part


Advanced users with knowledge of Microsoft SQL can modify  AQB web parts directly from the Everest Advanced Dashboard using SQL.  Only web parts that you create on the dashboard using SQL can be modified  on the dashboard using SQL.


Note: Modifications made to the Advanced Query Builder web  parts are reflected on the dashboard only. No changes are made to the  existing filters in **Everest**.
