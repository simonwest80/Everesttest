# Remove a Web Part from a Site


With the appropriate administrative rights, you can remove a web part  from the shared dashboard site. For example, you may want to remove a  default web part from the dashboard if it is not appropriate for your  business.

- Click the down  arrow following **Modified Shared Page**  at the top right of the dashboard to open the **Modified 
 Shared Page** menu.

 this Page**.

- Click the down  arrow following **Modified Shared Page**  at the top right of the dashboard to open the **Modified 
 Shared Page** menu.
