# Add an Advanced Query Builder Filter Web Part


The **Everest Advanced Query 
 Builder** is an advanced filter in **Everest**  that communicates directly with **Everest’s**  powerful Microsoft SQL database. This database is where all of the information  in **Everest** is stored.


It is not necessary to have knowledge of MS SQL to add an  existing Advanced Query Builder filter web part on your **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard**. Simply choose from a list of standard default  filters or any existing Advanced Query Builder filter created previously.


{:.steps}
