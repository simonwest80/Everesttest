<p>The <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>  adds an advanced business intelligence feature to your desktop. Business  Intelligence technologies allow in-depth analysis of your company’s data  and transactions after they occur for better decision-making. The System  Administrator, or other authorized user, uses the <strong>Everest</strong>  data warehouse <strong>Setup</strong> to create  a data warehouse from your <strong>Everest</strong>  database. This data warehouse contains important data collected from your  business through <strong>Everest</strong>.  Selected  information is provided to you, based on business requirements, and is  displayed in chart or graphic format on your <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong>.  These  blocks of information provided to you are called <strong>Web 
 Parts</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>Everest</strong>, the <strong>Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard</strong> can replace the <strong>Everest</strong>  desktop. The <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong>  is also available as a web page that can be accessed remotely. The <strong>Everest Advanced Dashboard</strong> uses the  power of <strong>Everest’s</strong> data integration  to provide you with necessary information used for:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Understanding your customers’ needs</li>
  <li>Increasing customer satisfaction</li>
