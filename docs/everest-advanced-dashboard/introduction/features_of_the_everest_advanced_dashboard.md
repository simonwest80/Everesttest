# Features of the Everest Advanced Dashboard


The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  adds an advanced business intelligence feature to your desktop. Business  Intelligence technologies allow in-depth analysis of your company’s data  and transactions after they occur for better decision-making. The System  Administrator, or other authorized user, uses the **Everest**  data warehouse **Setup** to create  a data warehouse from your **Everest**  database. This data warehouse contains important data collected from your  business through **Everest**.  Selected  information is provided to you, based on business requirements, and is  displayed in chart or graphic format on your **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard**.  These  blocks of information provided to you are called **Web 
 Parts**.


In **Everest**, the **Everest 
 Advanced Dashboard** can replace the **Everest**  desktop. The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  is also available as a web page that can be accessed remotely. The **Everest Advanced Dashboard** uses the  power of **Everest’s** data integration  to provide you with necessary information used for:

- Searching and reporting
- Performance metrics
- Monitoring key performance indicators for improvements
- Advanced analysis and more informed decision-making
- Understanding your customers’ needs
- Increasing customer satisfaction
- Prospecting new customers
- Gaining a competitive advantage



The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  gives you the ability to see mission critical information that is relevant  to you. The **Everest Advanced Dashboard**  can include graphs, reports, performance indicators, and reminders on  the dashboard depending upon how it has been configured.
