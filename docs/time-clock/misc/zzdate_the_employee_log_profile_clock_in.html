<p>Specify the clock-in date and time. This is a mandatory field. By default,  12:00 AM gets displayed beside the date when you select the date from  the drop-down calendar. Once this time is entered and saved, it does not  change when viewed with other time zone or daylight saving time (DST)  settings.</p>

<p>DST settings that change after an employee clocks in but before clocking  out impact only the clock out time and not the clock in time.</p>

<p class="example">On November 3, 2007, an employee clocks in  at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time changes at 2:00am on November 4, 2007.  The employee clocks out at 6:00am on November 4, 2007. The clock out time  of 6:00am is from the revised (changed) time.</p>
