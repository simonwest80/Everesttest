title: Clock out Time
---


Specify the clock-out date and time. This is a mandatory field. By default,  12:00 AM gets displayed beside the date when you select the date from  the drop-down calendar. Once this time is entered and saved, it does not  change when viewed with other time zone or daylight saving time (DST)  settings.


DST settings that change after an employee clocks in but before clocking  out impact only the clock out time and not the clock in time.


{:.example}
On November 3, 2007, an employee clocks in  at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time changes at 2:00am on November 4, 2007.  The employee clocks out at 6:00am on November 4, 2007. The clock out time  of 6:00am is from the revised (changed) time.
