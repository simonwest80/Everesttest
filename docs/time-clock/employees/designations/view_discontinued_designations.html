<p>When you discontinue a designation, it is temporarily unavailable for  selection. The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by activating  it again.</p>

<p class="steps">To view discontinued designations, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Time Clock</strong> &gt;  <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Designation</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Designations</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Designations</strong> browser, select <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>View Discontinued</strong>. You will  see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/time-clock/employees/designations/discontinuing_a_designation.html"><strong>Discontinued 
 Designations</strong></a> browser.</li>
</ul>
