<p>The <strong>Leave Requests</strong> browser displays  a list of all the leave used by employees and other related information.  Browser columns can be re-sized or moved as needed. You can add, edit  or discontinue leave from the browser. You need adequate security rights  to view and modify the <strong>Leave Requests</strong>  browser.</p>

<p>The <strong>Leave Request</strong> browser has  two views that can be accessed through <strong>View</strong>  menu:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>My Leave Requests</strong></dt>
  <dd>Allows you to view the leave requests that were  submitted by you or the leave requests for which you are either the Primary  Approver or Alternate Approver. By default, this option will be selected  under <strong>View</strong> menu. You can view  the leave requests of only the logged in user. The security right <strong>Leave Request Browser: View</strong> is required  to enable this view.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">Employee A reports to Employee B</p>

<p>Employee  B reports to Employee C</p>

<p>Employee  C reports to Employee D</p>

<p>When Employee A logs in and opens <strong>Leave 
 Requests</strong> browser, <strong>Everest</strong>  will check whether Employee A has adequate security right or not. If Employee  A has <strong>Leave Request Browser: View</strong> security  right, the <strong>Leave Requests</strong> browser  will appear with leave requests that were submitted by him/her or the  leave requests for which he/she is either the Primary Approver or Alternate  Approver.</p>

 All</strong> security right, the <strong>Leave 
 Requests</strong> browser with all the leave requests will appear.</p>
