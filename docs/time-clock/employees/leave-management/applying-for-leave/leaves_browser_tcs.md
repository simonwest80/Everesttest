# The Leave Requests Browser


The **Leave Requests** browser displays  a list of all the leave used by employees and other related information.  Browser columns can be re-sized or moved as needed. You can add, edit  or discontinue leave from the browser. You need adequate security rights  to view and modify the **Leave Requests**  browser.


The **Leave Request** browser has  two views that can be accessed through **View**  menu:


**My Leave Requests**
: Allows you to view the leave requests that were  submitted by you or the leave requests for which you are either the Primary  Approver or Alternate Approver. By default, this option will be selected  under **View** menu. You can view  the leave requests of only the logged in user. The security right **Leave Request Browser: View** is required  to enable this view.


{:.example}
Employee A reports to Employee B


Employee  B reports to Employee C


Employee  C reports to Employee D


When Employee A logs in and opens **Leave 
 Requests** browser, **Everest**  will check whether Employee A has adequate security right or not. If Employee  A has **Leave Request Browser: View** security  right, the **Leave Requests** browser  will appear with leave requests that were submitted by him/her or the  leave requests for which he/she is either the Primary Approver or Alternate  Approver.


**All Leave Requests**
: Allows you to view and edit all the leave requests.  The security right **Leave Requests: Approve/Reject/Cancel 
 All** is required to enable this view.


{:.example}
Employee A reports to Employee B


Employee  B reports to Employee C


Employee  C reports to Employee D


When Employee A clicks on All Leave Requests **Everest**  will check whether Employee A has adequate security right or not. If Employee  A has **Leave Requests: Approve/Reject/Cancel 
 All** security right, the **Leave 
 Requests** browser with all the leave requests will appear.


The browser options available under the **Options**  menu in **Leave Requests** browser  are as follows:


**Approve**
: Allows you to approve the leave request. This option  is enabled only if the record status is **Applied**  and you are either a Primary Approver or an Alternate Approver or a user  with adequate security right to approve all leave requests.
: When the leave request has been approved, the status  changes to **Approved**.


**Reject**
: Allows you to reject the leave request. This option  is enabled only if the record status is **Applied/Approved**  and you are either a Primary Approver or an Alternate Approver or a user  with adequate security right to approve all leave requests.
: When the leave request has been approved, the status  changes to **Rejected.**


**Cancel**
: Allows you to cancel your leave requests. The Primary  or Alternate approver or a user with adequate security right to approve  all leave requests, too can cancel the leave requests if it is not proper/valid.  This option is enabled only if the record status is **Applied**.
: When the leave request has been approved, the status  changes to **Canceled**.
