# The Shift Profile


Use the **Shift** profile to create  employee work shifts. The time zone and daylight savings time details  default from the client workstation’s operating system settings and not  the **Everest** settings when recording  a transaction. Once a transaction is saved, it does not change even when  viewed from different time zones or with different daylight savings settings.


{:.example}
If you enter and save the work shift time  as 9:00am to 6:00pm, the shift time does not change even when viewed from  other time zones.


**Code**
: Enter a unique code to identify the work shift using  1 to 15 characters of the supported type. You cannot edit this field once  you have saved the profile.


**Description**
: Enter a suitable description for the work shift  using 1 to 50 characters of any type.


Shift Time


**Start/End**
: Specify the start and end time of the work shift.  These fields are mandatory.

Lunch Time


**Start/End**
: Specify the start and end time of the lunch-break  for the work shift.


**Lunch Time is Paid**
