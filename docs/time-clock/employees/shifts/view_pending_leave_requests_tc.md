# View Pending Leave Requests


In order to edit time for a shift in the **Shifts**  browser, there cannot be any pending leave requests for that shift. Pending  leave requests have a status of “APPLIED”. Use the **Pending 
 Leave Requests** option in the **Shifts**  browser to view any pending leave requests.


{:.steps}
To view pending leave requests from the Shifts  browser, do the following:

- Select a shift  in the **Shifts** browser (path: **Time Clock** > **Setup**  > **Shifts**).
- From the **Shifts** browser, select **Options**  > **Pending Leave Requests**. The  **Leave Requests** browser opens and  displays the pending leave requests for the selected shift.



Any pending leave requests found must be processed directly from the  **Leave Requests** browser (path:  **Time Clock** > **Leave 
 Requests**). To process the leave requests, the status must be changed  to either “APPROVED, REJECTED, or CANCELLED”.
