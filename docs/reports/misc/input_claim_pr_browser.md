# Input Claim PI Browser


This browser lists all system and manual purchase invoices included  in the report.


You can select the purchase invoices on which you will be claiming tax  from this browser. When the required purchase invoices are selected and  the browser is saved, the **Claimed** check  box in the document profiles is automatically updated (selected) by **Everest**.


If the report is generated again for the same period, the documents  marked as "claimed" do not appear for selection in **Input****Claim PI Browser**.


The **Input Claim PI Browser** has  the standard browser options.
