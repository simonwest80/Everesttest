<p class="note">In the case of manual journals where you have  not assigned any tax codes, the report displays manual documents using  the journal’s jurisdiction tax code and tax component. If you have assigned  a tax code to some but not all taxable and exempt entries, entries with  a tax code appear under the appropriate tax code and tax component while  entries without a tax code appear under the tax code and tax component  “No GST (exempt) Acquisitions.”</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Summary/Detail</strong></dt>
  <dd>This option allows you to specify whether you want  to see a summarized or detailed report of the taxes. In both report types  the dates are organized as indicated in the Grouped By option. Select  <strong>Summary</strong> to see just the tax totals  for each date. Select <strong>Detail</strong> to  display the tax details for every item contained on each purchase or purchase  return document.</dd>
  <dd>Because manual documents do not include line items,  the Detail report represents the tax values of manual documents using  the <strong>Item used for displaying manual documents

  <dt><strong>Show Capital Acquisitions</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to display tax details for  capital acquisitions in the report. Any account in the item details grid  associated to a Fixed Asset is considered a capital acquisition.</dd>
  <dt>You can associate accounts to Fixed Assets  by including them in the Fixed Asset Posting Group in the accounting preferences  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; **Posting </dt>
  <dt> Group** tab).</dt>
  <dd>The report lists the capital acquisition accounts  first and lists all other accounts under “Other Acquisitions.”</dd>
  <dt><strong>The reporting requirements in Australia require  that capital acquisitions should be disclosed separately while reporting  GST.</strong></dt>
  <dd>If this check box remains unselected, only tax details  for purchases not considered capital acquisitions display in the report.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to select and display documents  based on the date of the vendors’ tax invoices.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example"><strong>In Australia, you can claim input tax credits  (GST credit  on Purchase) if you have a tax invoice from your supplier.</strong></p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Consider Payment Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to select and display documents  based on the payment date. This check box is enabled only if you select  the <strong>Vendor Tax Invoice Date</strong> check  box</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">While accounting for GST on a non-cash basis in Australia, you can claim  input tax credits (GST credit on Purchase) when your supplier has issued  an invoice or when you have paid them, whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>However, if an advance is paid against  a purchase order during a reporting period and the items are not invoiced  (i.e., the purchase order is not converted to a purchase invoice), the  input tax credit on this purchase order cannot be claimed in that period.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Show Documents</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to view the document numbers  associated with the taxes. In a Summary report, each document date is  totaled and lists the documents (with totals) created on each of those  dates. The Detail report is the same except that each document also lists  all of its items and their own totals.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Group by Tax Component</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this check box to view the tax details with  the original grouping further broken down by tax components within each  tax code. In a Summary report, each tax component lists the tax details  for both system and manual documents by date.
