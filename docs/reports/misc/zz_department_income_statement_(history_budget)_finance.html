<p>Select the location/sub-location to which the transactions have been  allocated. This allows you to obtain the income statement for a specified  location or sub-location or cost/profit center. For a report that includes  all locations, leave this field blank.</p>

<p class="note">If you select <strong>Budget</strong>  in the <strong>Report Type</strong> field, this  field is disabled as <strong>Everest</strong> does  not allow you set up budgets for individual locations/sub-locations. Instead,  the budget amounts are displayed for all locations/sub-locations.</p>
