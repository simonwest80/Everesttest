title: If Address Blank
---


Specify the address to be included in the report, in case the one mentioned  in the **Address Type** field is not  available in the database. The options are **None** and **Bill To**. Select **None** to leave the address field blank.  Since it is mandatory to specify the billing address, select **Bill 
 To** to  ensure that the address field in the report is never left blank.
