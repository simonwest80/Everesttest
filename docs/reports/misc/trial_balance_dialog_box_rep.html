  <dt><strong>Income and Expense Balance</strong></dt>
  <dd><strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to allocate expenses and revenues to specific sub-locations  or locations. Use this option to select the display of  income  and expense balances in the trial balance report.</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consolidated 
 for all Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>– If this option is selected, a single consolidated  amount is displayed against each account.   This  amount represents the total balance of that account and includes unallocated  amounts and allocations made to all locations/sub-locations.</li>
  <li><strong>Breakup 
 for all Locs/Sub-Locs</strong> – If this option is selected, the balance  in each income and expense account is broken up into unallocated amounts  and amounts allocated to each locations/sub-locations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Amounts displayed against locations and sub-locations  with sub-sub-locations only relate to amounts specifically allocated to  that location and sub-location; the balance does not include balances  of sub-sub-locations for that account.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Selected 
 Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>– If this option is selected, the balances of income  and expense accounts displayed pertain to amounts allocated to the selected  location/sub-location only.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Location/Sub-Location</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the location/sub-location for which you want  to generate the trial balance report. This field is enabled only when  the option <strong>Selected Locs/Sub-Locs</strong>s  specified. This allows you to obtain the income statement for a specified  location or sub-location or cost/profit center.</dd>
</dl>

<ul class="note">
  <li>The balances  of assets and liabilities will not be displayed with this selection, as  amounts accounted in asset and liability accounts cannot be allocated  to locations/sub-locations.</li>
  <li>Only amounts  allocated to the selected locations/sub-locations will be included in  the balance displayed; balances of sub-sub-locations will not roll up  into the balance of the selected location/sub-location.</li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt>The total of  debit balances may not equal the credit balances as the crossing entries  for a transaction may be allocated to other locations/sub-locations, or  may relate to asset and liability accounts.</dt>
