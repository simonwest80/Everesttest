<p>If there are only Unposted purchase Journals and no payment journals,  then none of these purchase documents appear in the report when the <strong>Posted Transactions Only</strong> option is selected.</p>

<p>Similarly if there are Unposted purchase Journals with corresponding  payment journals that are still Unposted, then the report will still not  display these purchase journals.</p>

<p class="example">Create a purchase invoice for $200 but do  not post the corresponding purchase journal in <strong>Everest</strong>.  Make a $100 payment and do not post the payment journal. If you select  the option <strong>Posted Transactions Only</strong>,  then neither the purchase journal nor the payment journal appears in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the payment transaction are not displayed.</p>

<p>Where a purchase journal is yet to be posted, but the corresponding  payment journal has been posted, then the report will display the document  amount as zero. In this situation, the document <strong>Paid</strong>  column will show the paid amount from the payment journal and the document  balance will be displayed as negative since Document Amount (0) - Document  Paid (xxx) = Document Balance (-xxx).</p>

<p class="example">Create a purchase invoice for $200 but do  not post the corresponding purchase journal in <strong>Everest</strong>.  Make a $100 payment and post the payment journal. If you select the option  <strong>Posted Transactions Only</strong>, the  posted payment journal is displayed but the document amount is zero, the  document paid shows the paid amount ($100) and the document balance is  negative (-$100).</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the posted payment transaction are displayed.</p>

<p>If there are posted purchase journals without any corresponding posted  payment journals, then the purchase journal appears in the report with  the document amount displayed, however the <strong>Paid</strong>  column is zero and the document <strong>Balance</strong>  column displays the document amount (which means the document is still  outstanding).</p>

<p class="example">Create a purchase invoice for $200 and post  it in <strong>Everest</strong>. Make a $100 payment  but do not post the payment journal. If you select the option <strong>Posted 
 Transactions Only</strong>, the posted purchase journal is displayed with  the document amount as $200.00; the document Paid shows the paid amount  as $0.00 (since it is not posted) and the document balance is $200.00  (the entire amount displayed is still outstanding).</p>

<p>Even if you check the <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong> option, the payment details are not shown, as the payment  transaction is not posted.</p>

<p>If there are posted purchase journals and the corresponding payment  journals have been posted, then the purchase journal appears in the report  with the document amount displayed. The document <strong>Paid</strong>  column displays the actual value from the Posted payment journal and the  document <strong>Balance</strong> column displays  the correct balance that is still outstanding (if any).</p>

<p class="example">Create a purchase invoice for $200 and post  it in <strong>Everest</strong>. Make a $100 payment  and post the payment journal. If you select the option <strong>Posted 
 Transactions Only</strong>, the posted payment journal is displayed, with  the document amount as $200.00; the document <strong>Paid</strong>  column shows the paid amount as $100 and the document <strong>Balance</strong>  is $100 (since only $100.00 is still outstanding).</p>

<p>However, if the document is paid in full, the transaction does not appear  in the report.</p>

<p>If the user has created only manual payment journals without a corresponding  purchase journal and the payment journal is yet to be posted, you will  not find these payment journals in this report.</p>

<p class="example">Create only a payment receipt for $200 but  do not post it in <strong>Everest</strong>. If  you select the option <strong>Posted Transactions 
 Only</strong>, the posted payment journal is not displayed.</p>

<p>If the user has created only manual payment journals without a corresponding  purchase journal and the payment journal has been posted, then these payment  journals appear in this report and the document amount is shown as zero.  In this situation, the document <strong>Paid</strong>  column will show the paid amount from the payment journal and the document  balance will be displayed as negative since Document Amount (0) - Document  Paid (xxx) = Document Balance (-xxx).</p>

<p class="example">Create only a payment receipt for $200 and  post it in <strong>Everest</strong>. If you select  the option <strong>Posted Transactions Only</strong>,  the posted payment journal is displayed but the document amount is zero,  the document paid shows the paid amount ($100) and the document balance  is negative (-$100).</p>

<p>If you select the option <strong>Show Payment 
 Details</strong>, the details of the posted payment transaction are displayed.</p>
