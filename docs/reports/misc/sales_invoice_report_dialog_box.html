 Cost -</strong> Select this option to display the most recent cost at which  the item was purchased, to be included in the report. The accounting cost  is the cost debited to the “Cost of Goods Sold” account or the  expense account for the item. If the item has factored cost enabled, the  costs are initially debited at factored costs and an adjustment is simultaneously  made for the cost factor. The accounting cost used is the factored cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Commission 
 Cost</strong> - Sales commission may be calculated based on actual cost,  average cost, last cost or user-defined cost depending on the option selected  in the <strong>Type of cost used for commission 
 calculation</strong> field (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other 
 Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Item Cost/Sales 
 Summary</strong> tab). Select this option if you want the profit to be calculated  and displayed based on the cost used for commission calculations. Costs  used for commission are inflated by the percentage cost factor if the  item has factor cost enabled.</li>
  <li><strong>User-defined 
 Cost -</strong> Select this option to include the cost indicated by the  user, in the report. You can calculate profits based on this cost.</li>
