You can filter the report to see only those purchase documents created  on a certain date or period. Selecting any option here except the **All** option, automatically populates  the **From** and **To**  fields, with the date range. You can edit the **From**  and **To** fields only when you select  the option as **Custom**. When a specific  date range is selected, then only those documents whose document date  lies in the above selected date range is included in the report.
