# Export Dialog Box


**Format**
: Select the required file format from the drop-down  list.


**Destination**
: Specify the location or application to which you  want to export the report. The available options are:

- **Application**  - Select this option to export the report to the application associated  with the format specified in the **Format**  field.



{:.example}
If you specify **Word 
 for Windows** **document** in  the **Format** field, and **Application**  in the **Destination** field, **Everest** opens the **Microsoft 
 Word** application, and displays the report in **Word 
 for Windows document** format.

- **Disk 
 File** - Select this option to export the report, in the specified  format, to a location where you want to store the file, for retrieval  at a later date.
- **Exchange 
 Folder** - Select this option to export the report to an e-mail message  in a Microsoft Exchange folder.
- **Lotus 
 Domino** - Select this option to export the report to a Lotus Notes  file.
- **Microsoft 
 Mail (MAPI)** - Select this option to export the report to MAPI (Messaging  Application Program Interface), which allows you to attach the report  to an e-mail message on Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook.



{:.note}
You can also export reports from the **Report Preview** dialog box. The export  options differ depending on whether you have selected **Low 
 Speed connection** in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; General &gt; 
 General Settings** tab). If you select this option, you can only  export reports to **Disk File**, and  very few file formats are supported.
