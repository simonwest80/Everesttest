title: Exclude Advances
---


Select this check box to exclude advances received against sales orders  or credit orders to be considered for aging calculation in the report.


Sales orders are displayed only if any advances have been received against  them. The **Paid** column in the report  output displays the amount received. The **Balance**  column displays the received amount as a negative value. When the balance  amounts are summed up for the customer, then the advance amounts received  against sales orders are subtracted from the overall balance amount.


The age is determined using the current date and the date on which the  payment has been received. In case of multiple receipts against the same  sales order, then all amounts falling in the same time bucket are summed  and displayed in the respective time bucket as a negative amount.
