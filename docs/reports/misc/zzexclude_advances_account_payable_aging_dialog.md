title: Exclude Advances
---


Select this check box to exclude advances paid against purchase orders  or debit orders to be considered for aging calculation in the report.


Purchase orders are displayed only if any advances are paid. The **Paid** column in the report output for  purchase orders displays the amount paid. The **Balance**  column displays the paid amount as a negative value. When the balance  amounts are summed up for the vendor, then the advance amounts paid against  purchase orders are subtracted from the overall balance amount. The age  is determined using the current date and the date on which the payment  has been made. In case of multiple receipts against the same purchase  order, then all amounts falling in the same time bucket are summed and  displayed in the respective time bucket as a negative amount.
