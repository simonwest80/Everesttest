<p>Enter the number of hours that employees have worked extra, after their  shift has ended, to be included in the report.</p>

<p class="example">An employee’s regular shift timings are from  9:00 a.m. till 18:00 p.m., but the employee has clocked out after 20:00  p.m., on some days. If you specify 2 in the <strong>Left 
 Late By (Hours)</strong> field, then each day that the employee worked extra  by more than 2 hours after the shift ended at 18:00 p.m., will be displayed  in the report.</p>

<p class="note">Decimal places entered in the <strong>Hours 
 Worked More Than</strong>, <strong>Hours Worked 
 Lesser Than</strong>, <strong>Left Early By (Hours)</strong>,  and <strong>Left Late By (Hours)</strong> fields  are rounded to the nearest whole number in the report.</p>
