<p class="note">In the case of manual journals where you have  not assigned any tax codes, the report displays manual documents using  the journal’s jurisdiction tax code and tax component. If you have assigned  a tax code to some but not all taxable and exempt entries, entries with  a tax code appear under the appropriate tax code and tax component while  entries without a tax code appear under the tax code and tax component  “No GST (exempt) Acquisitions Sales.”</p>
