title: Profit Based On
---


Select the cost base for calculation of profit for the document.
: The report may  be filtered based on the following:

- **Accounting 
 Cost -** Select this option to display the most recent cost at which  the item was purchased, in the report. The accounting cost is the cost  debited to the "Cost of Goods Sold" account or the expense account  for the item. If the item has factored cost enabled, the costs are initially  debited at factored costs and an adjustment simultaneously made for the  cost factor. The accounting cost used is the factored cost.
- **Commission 
 costs** - Sales commission may be calculated based on actual cost,  average cost, last cost or user-defined cost depending on the option selected  in the **Type of cost used for commission 
 calculation** field (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control 
 &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary** tab). Select this option if you want  the profit to be calculated and displayed based on the cost used for commission  calculation. Costs used for commission are inflated by the percentage  cost factor if the item has factor cost enabled.
- **User-defined 
 cost** - Select this option if you want to include the cost indicated  by the user to be generated in the report. You can calculate profits based  on this cost.
