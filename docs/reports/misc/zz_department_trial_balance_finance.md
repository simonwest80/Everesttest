- The balances  of assets and liabilities will not be displayed with this selection, as  amounts accounted in Â asset  and liability accounts cannot be allocated to locations/sub-locations.
- Only amounts  allocated to the selected location/sub-location will be included in the  balance displayed; balances of sub-sub-locations will not roll up into  the balance of the selected location/sub-location.
- The total of  debit balances may not equal the credit balances as the crossing entries  for a transaction may be allocated to other locations/sub-locations, or  may relate to asset and liability accounts.
