# Sales Tax


The **Sales Tax** report gives information  on the total sales tax to report to different authorities within a state  or collected during a specified period for both system and manual sales  documents appropriate for the search parameters. The report includes details  of the taxable and exempted sales. The total sales tax displays against  each document, and the total collections for each jurisdiction and the  grand total also display. All reports are grouped by tax code, location,  and jurisdiction.


Sales invoices appear in the Sales section of the report while credit  memos appear in the Returns section. In the case of a manual sales journal,  the amounts appear in the Sales section if the **Accounts 
 Receivable** account is debited or in the Returns section if the  **Accounts Receivable** account is  credited.
