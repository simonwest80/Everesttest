<p>This report displays a list of shoppers with the average time spent  on the online store. The report is generated based on the order of stores  in the <strong>Shop Administrator</strong>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Everest</strong>  generates a unique code when you choose the settings for the online store  (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>E-Commerce</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>).  This unique code is referred to as a website code and it identifies each  store. Each website code is linked to a store at the time of registration.  The fields <strong>Shop From</strong> and <strong>Shop To</strong> allow you to select the pre-defined  unique store codes.</p>
