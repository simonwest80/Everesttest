# Average Shopping Time


This report displays a list of shoppers with the average time spent  on the online store. The report is generated based on the order of stores  in the **Shop Administrator**.


{:.note}
**Everest**  generates a unique code when you choose the settings for the online store  (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **E-Commerce** > **Preferences**).  This unique code is referred to as a website code and it identifies each  store. Each website code is linked to a store at the time of registration.  The fields **Shop From** and **Shop To** allow you to select the pre-defined  unique store codes.
