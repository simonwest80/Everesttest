# Trial Balance


The **Trial Balance** report provides  you with a summary of all posted and unposted balances as on the last  day of the accounting period selected. The report displays the account  code, account name, balance at the beginning of the period, closing balance  at the end of the period and the period activity for each account. Credit  balances of accounts are shown as negative amounts and debit balances  as positive amounts.


Depending on your preferences, the report displays income and expenditure  balances for a specified location/sub-location, separately for all locations/sub-locations,  or a consolidated statement for all locations/sub-locations.
