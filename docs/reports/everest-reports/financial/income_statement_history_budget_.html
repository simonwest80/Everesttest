<p>The <strong>Income Statement</strong> (<strong>History/Budget</strong>) report, displays the  income and expenses for the specified period. The actual amounts in the  specified period are compared either with the amounts in the corresponding  historical period or with the budget for the specified period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The budget  report helps to compare the variance between budgets and actual amounts  in the selected period. It helps to analyze how closely the company is  adhering to the budget set up.</li>
  <li>The history  period helps to compare the performance of your company in a prior period  to the selected period.</li>
  <li>The report  can also be obtained for income and expenses allocated to locations/sub-locations.  However, budgets are not defined by locations/sub-locations. The report  does not display a breakup of the budget amount for each location/sub-location,  but the entire budget amount, for all locations/sub-locations.</li>
  <li>The income  statement is prepared with the posted balances by default and is generated  for a period that starts on the first date of the starting accounting  period and ends on the last date of the ending accounting period. You  can also include provisionally posted or unposted amounts, and hide accounts  with zero balance summary or details of each location’s income and expenses,  Other Income (Expenses) and Provisional Tax by selecting/not selecting  the required parameters.</li>
