# Income Statement (Period Comparison)


The **Income Statement (Period Comparison)** report compares income and expenses between any two periods in  the same or different fiscal years. This allows you to compare income  and expenses with past fiscal year(s). The report can also be obtained  for income and expenses allocated to a selected location/sub-location.  Alternatively, you can summarize the information for all your locations.


The income statement is generated for a period that starts on the first  date of the starting accounting period and ends on the last date of the  ending accounting period. You can include provisionally posted or unposted  amounts, hide accounts with zero balance, summary or details of each location's  income and expenses, Other Income (Expenses) and Provisional Tax by selecting/not  selecting the required parameters.
