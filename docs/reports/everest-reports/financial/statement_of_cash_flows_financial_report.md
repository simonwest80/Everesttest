# Statement of Cash Flows Report


Cash Flow Statements give you the ability to examine where cash moves  into and out of your company during a given time period. You can see the  changes in your Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. Important credit  and investment decisions are made using a company’s Cash Flow Statement  because the statement can be used to determine a company’s ability to  generate positive net cash flows, pay its debts, and meet its obligations.


Businesses use two types of Cash Flow Statements. They typically use  the **Direct Method** if they present  their company information on a cash basis and want to determine the amount  of cash paid. The direct method reports gross cash inflows and outflows  from operating activities. Businesses typically use the **Indirect 
 Method** if they present their company information on an accrual  basis. Businesses use the indirect method Cash Flow Statement to understand  the differences between their net income and net cash flow from operations.  To convert the accrual basis income statement to cash flow, net income  is adjusted for deferrals, accruals, and items that affect investing and  financing cash flows.


The **Statement of Cash Flows**  in **Everest** is reported using the  indirect method since **Everest**  supports the accrual method of accounting.  The  **Statement of Cash Flows Report**  in **Everest** provides you with a  detailed actual statement of cash flows.

In the accrual method of accounting, transactions  are recorded when income is earned or an expense is incurred.


Cash Flow Statements are subdivided into the following **Cash 
 Flow Activity** types:

- **Operating Activities**  – Generate revenue from producing and delivering goods or providing services
- **Investing Activities**  – Include the purchase and sale of business assets not included in the  company’s inventory
- **Financing Activities**  -  Include  borrowing and repaying creditors and owners



In **Everest**, you can specify any account  (including expense and revenue accounts) as a cash flow activity account.  This allows you to specify accounts of a non-financial nature such as  depreciation and amortization to be added to the amount of Net Income.

Revenue and Expense accounts can be included  in any activity, but it is recommended that you set the **Cash 
 Flow Activity** type for these accounts to **None**.


Accounts with an **Account** type  of **Bank** are not included in the  activities because the beginning and ending cash figures include all bank  accounts.

Mark Petty Cash as a **Bank**  account type if you want it included in the Statement of Cash Flows report.
