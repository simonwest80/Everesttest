<p>The <strong>Income Statement (Period Comparison)</strong> report compares income and expenses between any two periods in  the same or different fiscal years. This allows you to compare income  and expenses with past fiscal year(s). The report can also be obtained  for income and expenses allocated to a selected location/sub-location.
