{:.note}
A table is a data structure used to organize  information. In a relational database, as in **Everest**,  a table organizes the information about a single topic into rows and columns.  Each single piece of data is a field in the table. A column consists of  all the entries in a single field. Fields, in turn, are organized as records,  which are complete sets of information, each of which comprises a row.
