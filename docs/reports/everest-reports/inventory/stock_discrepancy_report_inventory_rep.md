# Stock Discrepancy Report 


The **Stock Discrepancy** report  displays details of the items for which a Stock Count document was created.  The discrepancy between the system stock and the physical stock of the  items in the selected bins is displayed as a Variance. You can also view  the value and percentage of this variance in this report.


You can generate this report before the Stock Count document is reconciled.  In other words, the Stock Count document must be in the Counted stage.


When defining the parameters for generating this report, you can sort  it by the various options provided. The report is thereby organized in  the order of the criteria specified.
