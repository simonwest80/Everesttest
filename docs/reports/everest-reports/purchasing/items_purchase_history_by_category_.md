# Items Purchase History


Use the **Item Purchase History**  report to display the purchase history of items. It also displays the  vendors from whom the items were purchased. This report includes the rate  at which the item was purchased for a purchase document type. Purchasing  departments can use this information in their negotiations with the vendor  for the best purchase price.


You can group this report by category, brand, or manufacturer. Â If  you decide not to group the report, the inventory summary is listed by  item code.
