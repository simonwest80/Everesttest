# Purchase Tax Details


The **Purchase Tax Details** report  displays the value of purchases and the taxes paid on them during a specified  period for both system and manual purchase documents appropriate for the  search parameters. The report includes details of the taxable and exempted  purchases. The total purchase tax displays against each document, and  the amount of recoverable tax also displays. All reports are grouped by  tax code, location, and jurisdiction.


Purchase invoices appear in the Purchases section of the report while  debit memos appear in the Returns section. In the case of a manual purchase  journal, the amounts appear in the Purchases section if the Accounts Payable  account is credited or in the Returns section if the Accounts Payable  account is debited.
