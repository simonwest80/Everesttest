<p>The <strong>Best Vendor</strong> report displays  the net purchase amount (Total Purchase amount minus Returns) for the  selected vendors, over a date and cost range. The report takes into account  only final documents (i.e. purchase invoices and debit memos), including  manual documents created for the vendors in order to calculate the net  cost. It is useful to identify vendors from whom maximum amount of net  purchases have been made, since the report displays those vendors with  maximum purchases at the top of the list in descending order. Negotiations  can be had with those vendors from whom maximum purchases are made and  markup can be improved. Further, vendors from whom limited amount is bought  over a period can be de-listed and orders for those items placed on other  vendors. The report displays the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Date range and  the Net Cost range for which the report is generated</li>
  <li>Code and Account  Name of the vendors</li>
  <li>Net Cost amount  (Total amounts in purchase invoices less debit memos) including all manual  documents created for the vendor</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Employees created as vendors are not included  in this report.</p>
