# Leave Request Details


The **Leave Request Details** report  displays specific leave details for each employee. It shows employee leave  applied, rejected, approved and cancelled. It lists the leave type used,  the applied and approved dates, the start and end dates for the leave,  and to whom the specified leave was applied for approval. This report  is useful for senior management during audits, as they can view the status  and time when the leave was used by subordinates and by whom they were  approved.
