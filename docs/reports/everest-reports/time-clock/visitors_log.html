<p>The <strong>Visitors Log</strong> report gives  a detailed overview of people who have visited your organization for different  purposes (official or personal), the organization from where they came,  their purpose of visit to your company, their names and in/out times and  the names of the persons whom they visited. This report can be of great  help to the administration department and also for security personnel  to track the entry and exit of visitors in case some issues crop up in  the smooth day to day running of your business. Visitor logs are of great  use to the management for identifying the date when some important discussion  might have taken place with a particular visitor and if someone else represented  the visitor in subsequent discussions.</p>
