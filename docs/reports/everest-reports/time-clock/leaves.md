# Leave


The **Leave** report displays a  list of employees who have availed leave, number of working days, days  present, days absent, days on leave and whether leave for the previous  month was approved. A snapshot of the leave taken by employees helps the  accounts department to calculate the salary payable to each employee.  Managers with proper security rights can also plan projects in hand, by  viewing the amount of leave due for each employee.
