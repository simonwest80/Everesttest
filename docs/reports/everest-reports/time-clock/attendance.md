# Attendance


The **Attendance** report displays  details of employee attendance, for a specified time period. It includes  the maximum and minimum hours worked for each employee, and whether the  employee worked on non-working days, for a specified shift. The report  helps the management to analyze employee productivity over a period, keep  a tab on employees who are not putting in the minimum required number  of hours of work each day, and reward those employees who have worked  extra hours in a given period of time.
