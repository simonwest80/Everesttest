# Customer Sales


The **Customer Sales** report displays  sales and discount values for each item sold during a specified period  to customers. The report is grouped by customers and item categories.  This report displays:

- Name and code  of the customer to whom the items are sold including total sales to individual  customers.
- Name and code  of the category, including the category sales total for items sold in  that category.
- The sales invoice  number and the date when it was created, to account for the sale.
- The item code,  item description from the item profile, quantity sold and unit of sales  measure for each item sold.
- The price per  unit, discount value for each line item and the amount for each item excluding  line item discounts.



This report can be utilized to execute the following functions:

- Identify item  categories and customers that account for a higher percentage of sales  total in a given period. Special promotion campaigns can be conducted  for these categories and directed towards customers.



{:.example}
If the category ‘clothing’ has shown a marked  increase in sales compared to other categories during the period November  to January, promotions can be increased during that period for that particular  category.

- Identify high  value item categories. Sales strategies can be devised accordingly, to  sell more items from those categories.
- Take adequate  steps to discontinue those categories with a minimal contribution to total  sales for the period.
