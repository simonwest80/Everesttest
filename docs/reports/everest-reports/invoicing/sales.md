# Sales


The **Sales** report lists sales  invoices and credit memos created in a specified time period and is sorted  on the basis of sales representatives. This report is important in analyzing  the company's sales and the performance of sales representatives. The  report is similar to the **Sales 
 Invoice** report, in that it lists all sales invoices created  during a particular time period. However, this report displays only summarized  information. It also displays additional information pertaining to the  taxable amount of the invoice and the related tax amount.


This report displays the sales figures for the respective journals that  are posted.
