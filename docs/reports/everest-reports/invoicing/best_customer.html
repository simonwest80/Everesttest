<p>The <strong>Best Customer</strong> report lists  customers from whom you have generated the maximum revenue or profit during  a particular time period. The report includes the customer code and name,  the revenue generated and the cost incurred, thereby giving you the volume  of business transactions with the customer. It also includes the profit,  margin and the markup for the customer.</p>
