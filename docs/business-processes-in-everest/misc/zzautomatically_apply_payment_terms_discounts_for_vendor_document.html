<p>Select this check box if you want <strong>Everest</strong>  to automatically compute the discount amount based on the Payment Term  while making payments to vendors on a purchase invoice. The discount percentage  has to be specified in the <strong>Discount (%)</strong>  field in the <strong>Payment Terms</strong> profile  (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Terms &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>). The amount that  is available for discount is automatically displayed in the <strong>Discount 
 available</strong> field in the <strong>Payment</strong>  dialog box. The discount amount that can be applied defaults to the discount  which is available and is displayed in the <strong>Discount 
 Applied</strong> field in the <strong>Payment</strong>  dialog box if the above option is selected. You can edit this field if  required.</p>
