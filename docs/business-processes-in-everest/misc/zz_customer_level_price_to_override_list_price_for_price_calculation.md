title: Customer level price to override list price for price calculation
---


This option alters the manner in which the least price is determined  in sales orders and invoices. Five types of pricing are considered by  the system to arrive at the least price:

- List price (Fixed  price/Mark up)
- Customer Level  price
- Quantity pricing
- Promotional pricing
- Special pricing  (Discount percent from least price/ Discount fixed amount from least price/Fixed  price/Markup over last cost/Mark up over average cost/Fixed amount over  cost/ Level pricing)



If this option is not checked, the least of the above five prices is  considered.


If this option is selected, the List Price is overridden with the Customer  Level Price if it is defined and only Customer Level price, Quantity pricing,  Promotional pricing, and Special pricing are considered to arrive at the  least price.


If this option is selected and a Customer Level price is not defined,  only the List Price, Quantity Pricing, Promotional pricing, and Special  pricing are considered to arrive at the least price.
