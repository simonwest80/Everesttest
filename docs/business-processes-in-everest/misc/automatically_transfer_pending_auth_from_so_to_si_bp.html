<p>Select whether or not pending credit card authorizations available in  the sales order should be automatically transferred when a sales order  is converted to a sales invoice. Enabling this option allows you to more  easily process payments from the batch payment browsers after an order  has been shipped.</p>

<p class="note">When an order is partially invoiced and this  option is enabled, the system will transfer the pending authorization  to the partial invoice and retain a copy for the remainder of the order.  This copied batch payment will use the same credit card information but  will change to a “Sale” type transaction during future processing. The  type change happens because the authorization will be consumed by the  partial invoice.</p>
