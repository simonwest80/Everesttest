Check this option if you want sales and credit documents to be printed  using quick reports. Quick reports enable faster printing of document  reports over a network on a laser printer.


Leave this box unchecked if you want to print documents using crystal  reports.


The option **Print using Quick report**  will be checked by default in the printing preferences profiles, if you  have checked it in the Default Printing Preferences in **Everest**.
