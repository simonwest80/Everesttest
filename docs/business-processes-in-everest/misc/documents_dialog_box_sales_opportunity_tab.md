# Documents Dialog Box - Opportunity Management Tab


Use this tab to identify the default reason for closure,  for opportunities that are automatically closed and the customer action  that must be associated with such opportunities.

Identifying these defaults enables you to further analyze the deals  that have been won/lost.


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you convert a sales quote to an order, **Everest** automatically closes the opportunity associated with the quote.  You can specify the default reason for closure as "To be assigned".  Your sales manager can generate a report of opportunities marked as "To  be assigned", and then get the relevant sales representatives to  specify the correct reason closed. This allows you to make sure that sales  representatives enter accurate data not only for those opportunities that  are manually closed, but also for the opportunities closed by the system<font style="color: #000080;" color="#000080">.</font>
