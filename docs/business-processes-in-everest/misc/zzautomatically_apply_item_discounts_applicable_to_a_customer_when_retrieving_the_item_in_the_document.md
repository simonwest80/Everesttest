Select this check box to automatically apply item discounts applicable  to a customer when retrieving the item in the document. This option automatically  applies item discounts based on special pricing rules or quantity discounts  for selected customer levels, when items are retrieved into a sales document.  The discounts related to items are defined in the **Sales**  tab of the **Item** profile (path:  **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window**).


{:.example}
Item discounts are set for special items like  computer consumables for customers who place bulk orders. Â **Everest**  allows you to apply the special pricing allowed for the customer when  such an item is pulled into a document.
