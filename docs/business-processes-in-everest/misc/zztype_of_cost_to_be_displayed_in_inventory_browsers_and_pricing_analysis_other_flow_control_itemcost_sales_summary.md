title: Type of cost to be displayed in inventory browsers and pricing analysis
---


Set the default item cost type to be displayed in the **Items** browser, stock transfer documents and browsers, and the **Pricing**Analysis dialog box.


The prices displayed in these browsers depend on whether you are in  extended mode or not. All the costs of the item are displayed as such  when you are in extended mode. On clearing the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings**), the display  of the different costs varies.
