<p>The tax breakup is displayed above the “document totals” section  on the document report. If there are more than two tax components in the  document, only one tax component will be displayed and printed separately.  This tax component is determined based on the sort order of the tax component  codes. The remaining tax components are grouped together and displayed  under the heading “Others”.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" />  The  tax charged on a sales document comprises the following tax components:</p>
