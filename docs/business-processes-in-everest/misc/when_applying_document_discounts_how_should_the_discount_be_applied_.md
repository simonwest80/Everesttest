# When applying document discounts how should the discount be applied?


This field identifies how global discounts are applied. You can select  **Options &gt;** **Document**  > **Document Discount** from the  sales document profile and specify the discount percent. When applying  discounts in sales documents, you can reduce the **Item 
 Price**, or retain the item price and display the Discount Amount  applied. Select one of the following options to apply the document discount:


| **Option** | **Description** |
| Discount% | The discount amount and percentage are displayed in the respective columns  for each item in the document. |
| Price | The item price displayed in the document is reduced by the discount  amount. The discount columns do not display any values. |



{:.example}
A company allows a discount of 3% on total  bill amount while another company gives a discount price of $25 on the  total bill amount if the bill amount exceeds $250. The settings allow  you to select the correct option.
