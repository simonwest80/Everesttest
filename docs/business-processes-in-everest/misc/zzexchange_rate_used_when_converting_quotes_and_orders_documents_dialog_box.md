title: Exchange rate used when converting quotes and orders
---


Use this field to indicate the default exchange rate to be used while  converting purchase and sale documents. The options available are:


| **Option** | **Description** |
| Prompt user with the exchange rate available as on date logged in | **Everest** prompts you to confirm  whether you want to use the latest exchange rate available on the login  date (for the document currency). This option is selected by default. |
| Use the exchange rate on the document being converted | The **Exchange Rate** field defaults  to the exchange rate available on the document you process. |
| Use the exchange rate available as on date logged in | The **Exchange Rate** field defaults  to the latest exchange rate available on the login date, when you process  the document. |



The exchange rate defined in this field is used when:

- Purchase/debit  quotes are converted to purchase/debit orders
- Sales/credit  quotes are converted to sales/credit orders
- Purchase/debit  orders are converted to purchase invoices/debit memos
- Sales/credit  orders are converted to sales invoices/credit memos
- Purchase orders/receipts  are converted to purchase invoices



This preference does not apply when you convert multiple  purchase orders into a single purchase receipt or purchase invoice. In  these cases the purchase receipt/invoice uses the latest exchange rate.
