Enter the maximum number of records that can be retrieved into a browser  by clicking the "Get" button. If more records have to be retrieved  at a time into the browser, the user must have appropriate security rights.


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If 100  is specified in this field, you can get only 100 records at a time into  any browser. If you need to retrieve more than 100 records at a time,  the "Get records above threshold limit in a browser" right must  also be assigned to you.
