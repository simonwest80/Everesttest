title: Prompt if the ordered/received quantity is less than EOQ
---


Check this box to have the system prompt you on saving the  document if the input quantity ordered in a purchase order or received  in a purchase receipt differs from the EOQ. When prompted, you may save  the document with the different quantity or postpone the save so you can  edit the ordered/received quantity.


On migration from Everest 3.0 to Everest 4.0, the system  defaults to Single Unit of Purchase Measure for the default quantity with  the prompt checkbox checked. When setting up a new company, the system  defaults to EOQ with the prompt checkbox unchecked.
