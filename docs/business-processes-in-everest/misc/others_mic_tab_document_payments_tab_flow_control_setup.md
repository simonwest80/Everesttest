**Prompt when trying to retrieve and serialize  an item that is not already present on a document**
: Use this option to first select the item, enter  the quantity and then attach the serial numbers committed to the document  when creating a sales or purchase return document. When retrieving serial  numbers, you may retrieve the serial number of an item that is not added  to the document. If you do not check this box, **Everest**  automatically adds the item code of the serial number to the document.
