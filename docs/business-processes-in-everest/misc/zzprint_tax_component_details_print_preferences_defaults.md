title: Print Tax Component Details
---


Check this option to print the tax-component details (tax component  description and value of tax) for  each tax code contained in a purchase/sale document.


If you select this option, the **Print 
 Tax Component Details** check box on the **Document 
 Printing Preferences** dialog box is selected by default.


The tax breakup is displayed above the "document totals" section  on the document report. If there are more than two tax components in the  document, only one tax component will be displayed and printed separately.  This tax component is determined based on the sort order of the tax component  codes. The remaining tax components are grouped together and displayed  under the heading "Others".
