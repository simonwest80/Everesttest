<p>Check this option to display the printed documents in matrix  format for matrix items. When this option is checked, line items that  are part of a matrix group will be printed in a matrix format. Printing  in matrix format can greatly reduce the amount of space/paper it takes  to print out a document with a large number of matrix items. Vendor part  numbers and serial numbers will not display if you select this option.</p>
