title: Customer Action

Specify the default customer action selection that must be associated  with sales opportunities that are automatically closed. Only actions that  belong to the group selected in the **Customer 
 Action Group** field are available for selection.


When a sales opportunity is automatically closed, the customer action  selection specified in this field is automatically displayed in the **Customer Action** field of the related  **Sales Opportunity** profile (path:  **Sales Order** profile > **Options** > **Edit 
 Opportunity &gt; Details** tab).


{:.example}
If you specify the default customer action  as "Demonstration for Add-on Products", the same is displayed  in the **Customer Action** field of  the **Sales Opportunity** profile  (path: **Sales Order** profile >  **Options** > **Edit 
 Opportunity &gt; Details** tab).
