title: Retrieve all open invoices, open credit memos and sales orders with deposits when a customer is selected in a receipt journal
---


Use this option to indicate whether all open invoices and credit memos,  and sales orders with ‘available’ deposits must be displayed when you  select a customer in a receipt journal. Clear this option if you have  a large database, and data retrieval takes time.
