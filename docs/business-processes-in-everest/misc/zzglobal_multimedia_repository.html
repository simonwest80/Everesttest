<p>Specify the global directory in which the multimedia files are located  in this field. This directory should be shared on the network with full  rights so that users can access the file attached from the multimedia  browser in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>The local repository specified in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box takes precedence over the global one defined  in the <strong>Other Default</strong> preferences.  <strong>Everest</strong> copies the file to the  global repository only when the local repository is not specified.</p>

<p>If the multimedia repository is specified neither in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> nor in the default preferences, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you that the files will not be copied to the global multimedia  repository. The option <strong>Copy to Multimedia 
 Repository</strong> is disabled in the profiles, and the files can be accessed  only by the user who saves the file.</p>
