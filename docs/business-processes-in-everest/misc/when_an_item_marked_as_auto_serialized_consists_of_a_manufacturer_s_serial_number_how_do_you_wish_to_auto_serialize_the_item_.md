# When an item marked as auto-serialized consists of a manufacturer's  serial number, how do you wish to auto-serialize the item?


Specify how auto-serialized items that have been assigned the manufacturer's  serial numbers should be attached to sales orders and invoices. When an  auto-serialized item is sold, the items with serial numbers are automatically  selected from the default stock area and assigned to the sales document.

This field offers you the following options:


| **Option** | **Description** |
| Auto Serialize without prompting | Automatically auto-serializes the item in the sales document. In this  case, the manufacturer's serial numbers of the items actually shipped  may differ from the serial numbers attached to the sales document. |
| Skip such items | Skips the items with the manufacturer's serial numbers when automatically  attaching items to the sales document. You have to attach serial numbers  to the items with the manufacturer's serial numbers, whenever these items  are shipped. |
