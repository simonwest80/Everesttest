<h1 id="prompt-for-customer-credit-status-when-sales-order-is-converted-into--sales-invoice">Prompt for customer credit status when sales order is converted into  sales invoice</h1>

<p>Select this check box to be prompted when a sales order, which is being  converted to a sales invoice from the <strong>Pull 
 Sheet</strong> browser, has exceeded the customer’s credit limit. By default,  this option is selected.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pull Sheet</strong> browser displays  a list of the pick tickets that are generated. Use this browser to specify  the quantity actually picked for shipping by entering the quantity in  the <strong>Quantity Picked</strong> column or  using a bar code scanner.</p>

<p>After you have confirmed the picked quantity, it is committed on the  sales order retrieved into the browser. Thereafter, you can convert the  sales order to a sales invoice by selecting the option <strong>Convert 
 to Invoice</strong> from the <strong>Pull Sheet</strong>  browser.</p>

<p>If you have defined a credit limit for the customer for whom the sales  order is created, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts  you that the credit limit has been exceeded. If you do not possess the  required security rights, you are not allowed to convert the sales order  into a sales invoice.</p>
