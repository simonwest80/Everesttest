  <dd>If you select this option, the <strong>Print

 Printing Preferences</strong> dialog box while printing documents, is selected  by default.</dd>
  <dd>The tax breakup is displayed above the “document  totals” section on the document report. If there are two or more tax components  in the document, only one tax component is displayed and printed separately.  This tax component is determined based on the sort order of the tax component  codes. The remaining tax components are grouped together and displayed  under the heading “Others”.</dd>

</ul>

<dl>

Printing in matrix format can  greatly reduce the amount of space/paper it takes to print out a document  with a large number of matrix items. Vendor part numbers and serial numbers  will not display if you select this option.</dd>
  <dd>When you select this option, the <strong>Display 
 in matrix format</strong> check box is checked by default in the <strong>Document 
 Printing Preferences</strong> and <strong>Document 
 E-mail Preferences</strong> dialog boxes.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href=""></a>Blind Ship</strong></dt>
  <dd>Blind ship is the process of shipping to your customer’s  customer without providing details of the person actually shipping the  goods (i.e. you).</dd>
  <dt>If your customer ABC wishes that you directly  ship the items to XYZ (who is ABC’s customer) without letting XYZ know  that you shipped the items, you can do so using the **Blind </dt>
  <dt> Ship** feature.</dt>
  <dd>Use this option to enable the <strong>Blind 
 Ship Format</strong> option by default in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/print/document_printing_preferences_dialog_box.html"><strong>Document Printing Preferences</strong> dialog  box</a> for sales documents.</dd>
  <dd>Selecting this option replaces your company/location  logo and address with the customer’s address and logo (ABC in the above  example) while printing the packing slip. On the packing slip, the customer’s  bill to address (ABC in the above example) is replaced by the ship to  address of the customer’s customer (XYZ in the above example).</dd>

  <dd>You would ideally select this check box along with  the <strong>Packing Slip Format</strong> check  box. Otherwise the item prices would be at the price which you charge  your customer, who could be re-selling items to the end customer at a  higher value.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Print Line Notes</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this option to include inline notes when  printing documents.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Print Vendor Part Number</strong></dt>
