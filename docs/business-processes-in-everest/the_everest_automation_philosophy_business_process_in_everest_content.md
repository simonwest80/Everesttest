# The Everest Automation Philosophy


**Everest** provides necessary tools  to efficiently automate your business processes. A normal business routine  constitutes daily transactions such as purchase, sales, inventory and  warehouse management, manufacture, customer relationship, finance, and  management information. **Everest**  automates and integrates these routine business functions thus giving  managers more time to focus on strategic business decisions.


The **Everest** automation philosophy  is based on the following strategies:

- **A 
 non-modular solution** - The individual functions of a business are  automated not only within themselves but are also seamlessly  integrated with the other functions to ensure smooth flow of operations.
- **Real 
 time management information** - **Everest**  maintains and ensures availability of real-time information generated  by the business processes.

- **Global 
 Nature** - Â **Everest**  allows you to access your database from anywhere in the world. Your business  systems are no longer confined to your Local Area Network.
