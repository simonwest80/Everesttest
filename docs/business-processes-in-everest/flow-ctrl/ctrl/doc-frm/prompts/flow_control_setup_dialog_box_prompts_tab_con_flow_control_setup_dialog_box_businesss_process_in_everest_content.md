# Prompts 


The options in the **Prompts** tab  determine the level of user intervention required at various stages of  the document process. Depending on the selection, **Everest**  automatically executes the specified process, or prompts the user for  inputs. You can set prompt options for both sales and purchase documents.

If you  set the prompt option to automatically apply the deposit against the purchase  invoice, the deposit is adjusted against the purchase invoice amount and  the net amount appears as the balance due to the vendor.


The **Prompts** tab comprises the  following:

- [Purchase  Document Tab]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/flow-ctrl/ctrl/doc-frm/prompts/purchase-prompts/flow_control_setup_dialog_box_prompts_purchase_tab_con_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)
