# Credit Order


The **Credit Order** is the second  document generated in the sales return process. The credit order:

- Is created when  you issue a Return Merchandize  Authorization to the customer.
- Records details  of the proposed returns.
- Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered in assessing the quantities to be purchased).
- Records the dispatch  of items by a customer for repairs or replacement. You can record the  returned quantities and the stock areas in which you expect to receive  the returns.



The information in the credit order flows into the credit memo.


{:.note}
The credit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are **not**  generated when a credit order is created. A credit order can also be generated  from a sales invoice.
