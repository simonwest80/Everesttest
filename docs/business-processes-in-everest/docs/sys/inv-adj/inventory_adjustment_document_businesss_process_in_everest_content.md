# Inventory Adjustment Document


The **Inventory Adjustment Document**  is used to adjust the value and quantity of stocks as per the account  books, to the actual stocks (the two values may differ).


An inventory adjustment document is prepared to:

- Adjust the  cost of items in stock (Cost Adjustment).

- Protect profit  margins (Price Protection).



![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the selling price  of an item is calculated as a mark-up on cost and the costs have fallen    drastically;  you may want to maintain the selling price at the earlier levels. In this  case, you can adjust the cost of the item in stock.

- Make adjustments  to quantity (Quantity Adjustments).



**![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) When  there is a difference between the quantity in stock and the stock as per  your accounts, you can make the required adjustments by either writing  off stock or adding stock.**

- Compare the  stock as stated by the system with the actual physical count and prints  the reports of variance (Stock Count).



**![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The losses  in a financial year due to plain error, pilferage, shoplifting, or general  damages badly affect the financial figures at the year-end accounting  procedures. To maintain accuracy and ease the process of physical counting,  you can use the Stock Count document.**
