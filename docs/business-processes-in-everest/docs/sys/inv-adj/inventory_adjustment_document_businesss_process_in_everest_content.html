<p>The <strong>Inventory Adjustment Document</strong>  is used to adjust the value and quantity of stocks as per the account  books, to the actual stocks (the two values may differ).</p>

<p>An inventory adjustment document is prepared to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjust the  cost of items in stock (Cost Adjustment).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" />  When  a supplier sends a supplemental bill for the items already taken into  stock, the cost of the items in stock must be amended to reflect the new  cost.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protect profit  margins (Price Protection).</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If the selling price  of an item is calculated as a mark-up on cost and the costs have fallen    drastically;  you may want to maintain the selling price at the earlier levels. In this  case, you can adjust the cost of the item in stock.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make adjustments  to quantity (Quantity Adjustments).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" /> When  there is a difference between the quantity in stock and the stock as per  your accounts, you can make the required adjustments by either writing  off stock or adding stock.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Compare the  stock as stated by the system with the actual physical count and prints  the reports of variance (Stock Count).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" /> The losses  in a financial year due to plain error, pilferage, shoplifting, or general  damages badly affect the financial figures at the year-end accounting  procedures. To maintain accuracy and ease the process of physical counting,  you can use the Stock Count document.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  All  Inventory Adjustment documents are final documents. Accounting entries  are generated automatically for these documents.</p>
