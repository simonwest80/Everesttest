<h1 id="purchase-quote">Purchase Quote</h1>

<p>The <strong>Purchase Quote</strong> is the first  document generated in the purchase process. The purchase quote:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Records quotation  details received from vendors.</li>
  <li>Helps the Purchase  department evaluate quotes from various vendors and place an order against  the best quote.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the purchase quote flows into the purchase order  and from the purchase order into the purchase receipt and purchase invoice.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  The  purchase quote is an intermediate or pending document. Accounting entries  are <strong>not</strong> generated when a purchase  quote is created.</p>
