<p>The <strong>Debit Order</strong> is the second  document generated in the purchase return process. The debit order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is created when  you have identified the items to be returned to a vendor.</li>
  <li>Defines the exact  items to be returned, or the stock area from which they are to be returned.</li>
  <li>Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered when assessing free stock).</li>
  <li>Is also used to  record the dispatch of items to a vendor for repairs or replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The information in the debit order flows into the debit memo.</p>

<p class="note">The debit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are <strong>not</strong>  generated when a debit order is created.</p>
