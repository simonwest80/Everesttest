<p><strong>Everest</strong> records journal entries  created by the user, directly (without the use of System documents) as  Manual documents. They consist of orders or final documents only, which  are included in the <strong>Vendor</strong> and  <strong>Customer</strong> aging browsers.</p>

<p>The document numbers are automatically generated when you create Manual  Purchase and Sales Journals. <strong>Everest</strong>  prefixes these numbers with an ‘M’, to denote that it is a manual document.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  can directly record the transaction of miscellaneous items that are either  of low value, or are not regularly dealt in, in a Purchase or Sales Journal,  as the case may be.</p>
