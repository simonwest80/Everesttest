<p>Global Multimedia Repository</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Global Multimedia Repository</strong></dt>
  <dd>You can specify the global directory in which the  multimedia files are located in this field. When you specify the multimedia  repository paths, the local repository specified in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> takes precedence over the global one defined in the <strong>Other Default</strong> preferences. Only when  the local repository is not specified, <strong>Everest</strong>  copies the file to the global repository. If the multimedia repository  is specified neither in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> nor in the default preferences, <strong>Everest</strong>  informs you that the files will not be copied to the global multimedia  repository. The option <strong>Copy to Multimedia 
 Repository</strong> is disabled in the profiles and the files are accessed  from the path from where they are attached. The file is available only  to the user who saves the file and cannot be viewed by other users.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" /> • The global repository specified  in the <strong>Other Default</strong> preferences  should be shared with the network with full rights. All users can then  access the file attachments specified in the multimedia browser.</dd>
  <dd>• If you change the Multimedia Repository path,  all files in the Multimedia Repository can be accessed from the new location  provided that they are manually moved to the new location.</dd>
  <dt><strong><a href=""></a>Freight Padding</strong></dt>
  <dd>Freight Padding is an additional charge over the  actual freight expenses. This amount is treated as a profit. Freight padding  is computed only on sales and sales return documents; and is accounted  as normal freight charges.</dd>

<p>: <img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/note.gif" alt="" />  You  can also enter a negative amount/percentage. However, the net freight  amount after applying the padding cannot be less than zero (i.e. freight  cannot be negative).</p>

<p><strong>Define % change permitted to line item amounts  on saved purchase receipts/invoices</strong></p>

<p>This section allows you to specify the percentage increase or decrease  that you would like to permit for the editable fields in a purchase receipt  or invoice. Adequate security rights are required to modify a purchase  receipt or invoice beyond the specified limits.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>% Change allowed for increases</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify a value permissible for an increase in the  amount of a purchase receipt/invoice. If the percentage <strong>increase 
 on editing a purchase receipt/invoice is expected to exceed the permissible 
 limit, you are not allowed to modify the document. By default, this field 
 will have 0%.</strong></dd>
  <dt><strong>% Change allowed for decreases</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify a value permissible for a decrease in the  amount of a purchase receipt/invoice. If the percentage <strong>decrease 
 on editing a purchase receipt/invoice is expected to exceed the permissible 
 limit, you are not allowed to modify the document. By default, this field 
 will have 0%.</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">The permissible % change will be calculated  for each line Item individually on the Line Item net amount and not on  the Document Amount.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>

<p>You create a purchase receipt for an item wherein the item price/unit  is $10 and the add-on cost is $50. The percentage change allowed for increases  is 10%. At a later date, you modify the document to increase the item  price/unit to $20 and reduce the add-on cost to $45.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The percentage change for this modification is calculated as follows:</dt>
  <dd>Original Purchase  Receipt Line Item Amount - $60 ($10 + $50)</dd>
  <dd>Modified Purchase  Receipt Line item Amount - $65 ($20 + $45)</dd>
  <dd>% Change = Variance  in Amount / Original Amount * 100</dd>
  <dd>=  5 / 60 * 100</dd>
  <dd>=  8.33%</dd>
</dl>

<p>Since 8.33% falls within the permissible percentage of change for increases,  you can modify the purchase receipt.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>

<p>You create a purchase receipt for an item wherein the item price/unit  is $10 and the add-on cost is $50. The percentage change allowed for decreases  is 30%. At a later date, you modify the document to reduce the item price/unit  to $5 and the add-on cost to $40.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>The percentage change for this modification is calculated as follows:</dt>
  <dd>Original Purchase  Receipt Line Item Amount - $60 ($10 + $50)</dd>
  <dd>Modified Purchase  Receipt Line item Amount - $45 ($5 + $40)</dd>
  <dd>% Change = Variance  in Amount / Original Amount * 100</dd>
  <dd>=  15 / 60 * 100</dd>
  <dd>=  25%</dd>
</dl>

<p>Since 25% falls within the permissible percentage of change for decreases,  you can modify the purchase receipt.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Default FOB Type in Purchase Documents</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the FOB (Free on Board) Type for all new  purchase documents. The FOB Type identifies both the physical location  where the title of the items passes to the buyers and the party responsible  for payment of freight.</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li><strong>FOB 
 Origin</strong> - Indicates that the buyer assumes title to the goods the  moment the carrier signs the bill of lading. The buyer is responsible  for paying shipment charges incurred.</li>
  <li><strong>FOB 
 Destination</strong> - Indicates that the seller retains title to the goods  until the goods are delivered to the buyer. The seller is responsible  for payment of freight charges incurred until the goods reach the destination.</li>
