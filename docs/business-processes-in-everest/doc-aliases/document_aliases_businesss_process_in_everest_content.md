# Document Aliases


If your company has several types of business, you will require different  documents for each business type. Use document aliases to create any number  of alternate names or aliases for each type of document.


{:.example}
If you sell products and provide services, you may want to use sales  quotes, sales orders and sales invoices for your product lines and service  quotes, service orders and service bills for your services.


You could create an alias called ‘Contract Proposal’ to record sales  quotations for service contracts, and an alias called ‘Repair and Service  Orders’ for repair jobs.


The document alias is associated with each stage of the sales or purchase  process: sales/purchase quotes, sales/purchase orders, purchase receipts,  and sales/purchase invoices.
