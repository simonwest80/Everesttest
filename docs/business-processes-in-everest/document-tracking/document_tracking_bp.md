# Document Tracking


Use the **Document** **Tracking**  dialog box to track the status of each document based on the tracking  groups that you have setup for that document type.


{:.example}
If you want to track the approval status for  purchase quotes, you can setup a tracking group called Quote Approvals.  Whenever a quote is created or its approval status changes, you have to  tag it with the appropriate choice for the tracking group Quote Approvals  through the Custom Tracking window.

Document Tracking flow control preferences determine whether the Custom  Tracking window will pop up all the tracking groups set up for the document  type. You can select the settings for Document Tracking, for the documents  listed below:

- [Purchase  Documents]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/docs/sys/purch/purchase_documents_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)
- [Purchase  Return Documents]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/docs/sys/purch-ret/purchase_return_documents_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)
- [Sales  Documents]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/docs/sys/sales-documents/sales_documents_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)

- [Point  of Sale Documents]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/docs/sys/pos/point_of_sale_pos_documents_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)



You can set up your preferences for each document by selecting any one  of the following options:


| **Never** | The Custom Tracking window does not pop up. To track a document, you  have to select the **Custom Tracking**  option from within the document or from the document browser. By default,  this will be selected for all the document types. |
| **When creating document** | The Custom Tracking window pops up whenever a new document is created  and saved. |
| **Always** | The Custom Tracking window pops up when a document is modified and the  modifications are saved. |
