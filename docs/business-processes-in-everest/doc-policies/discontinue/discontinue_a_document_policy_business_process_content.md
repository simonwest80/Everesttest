# Discontinue/Reactivate a Document Policy


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of document policies. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
If a document policy is selected in the default preferences for a document,  it cannot be deactivated.
