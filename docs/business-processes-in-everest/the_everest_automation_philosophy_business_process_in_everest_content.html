<h1 id="the-everest-automation-philosophy">The Everest Automation Philosophy</h1>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides necessary tools  to efficiently automate your business processes. A normal business routine  constitutes daily transactions such as purchase, sales, inventory and  warehouse management, manufacture, customer relationship, finance, and  management information. <strong>Everest</strong>  automates and integrates these routine business functions thus giving  managers more time to focus on strategic business decisions.</p>

<p>The <strong>Everest</strong> automation philosophy  is based on the following strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A 
 non-modular solution</strong> - The individual functions of a business are  automated not only within themselves but are also seamlessly  integrated with the other functions to ensure smooth flow of operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Real 
 time management information</strong> - <strong>Everest</strong>  maintains and ensures availability of real-time information generated  by the business processes.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/img/example.gif" alt="" /> Customer and item information  are updated as soon as a sales transaction is created. This ensures that  real-time information is available, on all aspects of your business, at  all times.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global 
 Nature</strong> -  <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to access your database from anywhere in the world. Your business  systems are no longer confined to your Local Area Network.</li>
</ul>
