# The Posted Payment Journal Transactions Browser


The **Posted Payment Journal Transactions** browser is displayed when the **General 
 Ledger (Detail)** option (path: **Posted 
 Payment Journals** browser **&gt; 
 Options &gt; Transactions &gt; General Ledger (Detail)**) is selected.  This browser lists all the transactions in the selected journal with details  such as the document number, reference data, payment terms and amounts  debited or credited.


If payment is made through a credit card, the card number is displayed  in the **Reference** column. Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).


The options common to all browsers are also available in this browser.
