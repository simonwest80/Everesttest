<p>This browser is displayed when the <strong>Payment 
 Method (Summary)</strong> option (path: <strong>Posted 
 Receipt Journals</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Transactions</strong> &gt; <strong>Payment 
 Method (Summary)</strong>) is selected. The <strong>Posted 
 Receipt Journal Payment Method Summary</strong> browser lists all the payment  methods through which payments have been made by customers or refunds  made to customers, and the net amount debited or credited with each payment  method.</p>

<p>A net credit (indicated by ‘CR’  in the <strong>Type</strong> column) denotes that  the payments made through the selected method exceed receipts with that  method. A net debit (indicated by ‘DR’ in the <strong>Type</strong>  column) denotes that receipts exceed payments.</p>

<p>Options common to all browsers are available in this browser.</p>
