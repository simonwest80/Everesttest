<p>This option allows you to print a register of the checks. Doing so allows  you to review and perhaps process for approval, the payment/receipt information.  The report not only lists the names of the vendors/customers who are being  paid, but other details as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The individual  documents that are being paid and the amount of payment on each document.</li>
  <li>The balance  due for each document.</li>
  <li>The total being  paid for each vendor/customer as well as a grand total for all vendors/customers.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To view/print the pre-check register, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Multiple Payments/Receipts</strong> browser,  select <strong>Options &gt; Pre-check Register</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Print Multiple Payments/Receipts</strong>  dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Print</strong> to print the report. Select <strong>Preview</strong> to view the report on screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pre-check Register report prints in Letter paper size.</p>
