<p>Two  new journals are listed when a posted/unposted Journal is reversed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Reversed Journal  is changed into a new unposted General Journal in the <strong>Unposted</strong><strong>General Journal</strong> browser (path:  <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>General 
 Journal</strong>). This General Journal reverses the debit to credit amount  and credit to debit amount. The account with debit is credited and the  other account with credit is debited.</li>
  <li>The original General  Journal is listed in the <strong>Posted / Unposted 
 General Journal</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To change the new General Journal’s information  while reversing the journal, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the <strong>Replace reversed transaction with new transaction</strong>  checkbox in the <strong>Detailed</strong> <strong>Activity</strong> browser to change the new General  Journal’s information while reversing the journal. Only the <strong>Source 
 Type</strong> and <strong>Date of the General Journal</strong>  can be edited / changed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">The staff accountant while reversing the journal  entry (from the previous example), also replaces the journal entry to  create a new Journal for the correct amount of $4800.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the required  parameters and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table shows an example of the transactions  of the Replacement of Reversal Journal:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Date of Journal</td>
      <td>Acct. #</td>
      <td>Account Name</td>
      <td>Journal #</td>
      <td>Journal  Name</td>
      <td>Debit/Credit</td>
      <td>Amount</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>11410</td>
      <td>Inventory</td>
      <td>100143</td>
      <td>Manual General Journal</td>
      <td>Debit</td>
      <td>$4800</td>

<p>When you replace a reversed General Journal with a new General  Journal, two new General Journals are created. Both are unposted and can  be seen in the <strong>Unposted General Journal</strong>  browser (path: <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt;  <strong>General Journal</strong>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>A reversed General  Journal that nullifies the previous transaction.</li>
  <li>A new General Journal  with the information that you set.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first General Journal that you reversed is listed in  the <strong>Posted / Unposted General Journal</strong>  browser (Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Posted Journal from the Unposted General Journal</strong>  browser to view the Posted General Journal browser).</p>

<p>When you reverse a General Journal and replace it with a  new journal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The original General  Journal lists the transaction with a credit and debit entry.</li>
  <li>The reversed General  Journal shows the debit amount and account as credit amount and account.  The credit amount and account are reversed as debit amount and account.  The net effect is zero and so the General Journal is nullified.</li>
  <li>The new General  Journal shows the revised <strong>Source Type</strong>  and <strong>Date</strong> specified by you. The  debit and credit amounts are the same as the original General Journal.  The accounts to which the debit and credit amounts are shown are also  the same as the original General Journal.</li>
</ul>
