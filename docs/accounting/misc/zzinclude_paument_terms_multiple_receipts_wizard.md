Documents that contain the payment terms specified in this column will  be selected for the receipt/refund. By default, all the payment terms  that have been defined are displayed in this column but you have the option  of excluding payment terms, if required. To exclude a payment term, highlight  it and click on the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_exclude.gif) button. Clicking on the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_exclude_all.gif) button moves all the payment terms to the exclude column.
