<p>The <strong>Posted</strong> <strong>Payment 
 Journal Payment Method Summary</strong> browser is displayed when <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Payment 
 Method (Summary)</strong> is selected in the <strong>Posted 
 Payment Journals</strong> browser. This browser lists all the payment methods  through which payments have been made to vendors or refunds received from  vendors and the net amount debited or credited with each payment method.</p>

<p>A net credit (indicated by ‘CR’  in the <strong>Type</strong> column) denotes that  the payments made through the selected method exceed receipts with that  method. A net debit (indicated by ‘DR’ in the <strong>Type</strong>  column) denotes that receipts exceed payments.</p>

<p>The options common to all browsers in <strong>Everest</strong>  are available in this browser.</p>
