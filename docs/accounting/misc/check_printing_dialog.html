<h1 id="the-check-printing-dialog-box">The Check Printing Dialog Box</h1>

<p>The <strong>Check Printing</strong> dialog box  allows you to specify the check number and date. If you select multiple  journals before selecting the <strong>Print Checks</strong>  option, you are prompted with this dialog box once for every journal that  you highlight. This is to ensure that you can use appropriate pre-printed  stationery for printing the checks, if different bank accounts are selected  in the journals.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Journal #</strong></dt>
  <dd>The payment/receipt journal number is displayed  in this field. This field cannot be edited.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Bank account</strong></dt>
  <dd>The bank account from which the payment is being  made is displayed in this field. This is a display field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Next Check #</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the check number from which you want the printing  to commence. By default, the next check number for the bank account selected  in the payment/receipt journal is displayed in this field. You can change  this number if required.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  a new checkbook has been issued, enter the next check number in this field.</dd>
  <dt>If you have issued one of the checks in  a series manually, you will have to enter the next number in this field.  For instance, if you have printed checks upto  check # 2000 and you issue check number 2001 manually, you must enter  2002 in this field when you are issuing the next check.</dt>
  <dd>Checks are printed in order of the transaction number.  Thus the first check will be used for the first transaction, the second  for the next and so on.</dd>
</dl>
