<p>When assets and liabilities are re-measured, the profit or loss made  is notional and is therefore not directly taken as an income or expense  to the Profit and Loss account. They appear in the balance sheet as a  reserve. Use this option to specify the account to which re-measurement  gain/loss should be posted. You may select an asset or liability account  in this field.</p>

<p class="note">You can only select an account that has been  set up in the base currency.</p>
