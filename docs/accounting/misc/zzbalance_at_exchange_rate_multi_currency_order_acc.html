<p>This field displays the remaining balance in the base currency that  you would expect to receive if the balance in document currency was converted  to the base currency using the most current exchange rate. In our example,  the system uses the most current sell exchange rate. For purchase orders,  the system uses the most current buy exchange rate. You specify buy and  sell exchange rates in the Exchange Rate profile.</p>

<p>If you wand over the field, the system displays the exchange rate used  to calculate this field. Each time the applicable current exchange rate  is updated in the Exchange Rate profile, the value in this field changes  when you close and reopen the order. If a current exchange rate is not  defined for the currency combination, the field remains blank.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the value of the <strong>Balance 
 @ Ex. Rate</strong> field is a figure that you use for informational purposes  only and is not used to request additional funds from the customer. The  customer is not responsible for changes in the base currency totals due  to changes in the exchange rate.</p>

<p>Refer to the <strong>Calculation of Foreign 
 Exchange Gains and Losses</strong> topic for a detailed example.</p>
