<h1 id="miscellaneous-payment">Miscellaneous Payment</h1>

<p>Select this option when you want to make a payment to the vendor by  selecting a General Ledger account of your choice, without creating a  purchase invoice.</p>

<p><strong> </strong>Such  payments are not recorded in the vendor transaction history since the  payment is not associated with any document.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Purchase  of stamps can be accounted as miscellaneous payments.</p>

<p>When this entry type is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot  specify a document number (in the <strong>Document 
 #</strong> column of the <strong>Transaction Entries</strong> section) since this is a direct payment for an expense and the  Accounts Payable control account is not credited.</li>
  <li>You can debit  or credit the required account.</li>
</ul>
