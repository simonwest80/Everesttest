# Deposit Status


The two types of deposit statuses are:


**Mark Deposit**


Select **Change Deposit Status**  > **Mark Deposit** on the right-click  menu of a payment or from the **Options**  menu to select the **Deposited** column  for a payment.


**Clear Deposit**


Select **Change Deposit Status**  > **Clear Deposit** on the right-click  menu of a payment or from the **Options**  menu to deselect the **Deposited**  column for a payment.


{:.example}
John, an Accounting clerk, included 10 checks for $5,000  received on 09/01/08 on the deposit slip. At the end of the day, as he  was leaving to go to the bank, customer Pam called and requested him to  hold her check # 205 for $125. She promised him that the funds would be  available the very next day, and requested him to deposit it after a day.


So, John removes this check manually from the bunch and changes  the deposit slip total and amount manually.


In Everest, he changes the deposit status for check # 205  from deposited to cleared.


This will display this check again in the bank deposit wizard  the next day (otherwise it would not have been displayed in this wizard).  John can select it again and include it on the deposit slip the next day.


{:.warn}
Warning: If the deposit status is marked 'Deposited'  in the Payments Register browser, the receipt will not be listed in the  Bank Deposit Wizard even if the receipt is still undeposited and vice  versa. Be extremely cautious while marking a payment as deposited in the  Payments Register browser; it is a good practice to restrict security  rights for changing the deposit status in this browser only to authorized  personnel.
