Select this option if the journal has printed correctly. If the **Allow user to post a journal even if it 
is not printed** option has NOT been selected in the **Other Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > Preferences > **Flow** **Control** > **Other** **Flow** Control), the journal can only be posted only if you select the **Marked as 
printed** option.
