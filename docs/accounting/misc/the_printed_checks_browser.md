# The Printed Checks Browser


The **Printed Checks** browser is  displayed when checks have been <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">printed. A check 
 that is marked as &quot;printed&quot; cannot be printed again. Thus use 
 this browser to identify the checks that have printed correctly. The che</font>cks  that are not selected in this browser can be printed again.


<font color="#000000" class="hcp2">The </font>**Reference Number**<font color="#000000" class="hcp2"> 
 field in the 'Check Display Section' 
 of the </font>**Payment/Receipt 
 Journal** <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">profile is updated with check 
 numbers of the checks that have been selected in this browser. </font>
