<p>Use this field to specify the period (such as the month or week, depending  on how you have defined your fiscal year and periods) up to which the  year should be closed. This is a mandatory field.</p>

<p>The number of accounting periods that are NOT closed is displayed by  default in this field. This can be changed as required. If the year preceding  the login date’s financial year has been closed, this field displays the  number of accounting periods before the log-in date.</p>

<p>A year can also be partially closed by selecting the required period  up to which the financial year should be closed.</p>

<p>If you are partially closing a year, you have to specify the <strong>New 
 Year code</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> to  create a new year that will contain the remaining open periods.</p>
