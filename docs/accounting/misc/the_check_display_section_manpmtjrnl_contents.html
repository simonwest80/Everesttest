  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  your vendor wants the payee address to be a branch office, which has not  been set up as the billing address, you would change this information.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>This section is used to specify the date on which  the payment or refund takes effect. The default date displayed is the  transaction date.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you want to issue a post-dated check to a vendor, the check date has to  be entered here.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Amount</strong></dt>
