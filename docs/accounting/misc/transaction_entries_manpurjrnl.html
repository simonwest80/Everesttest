<dl>
  <dt><strong>Short/Over</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field displays the amount by which the transaction  is out of balance (i.e. the amount of difference between the debits and  credits). This amount is automatically computed.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Account</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the account to be debited or credited in  this column. The Accounts Payable Control account displayed by default,  as the first entry in this column cannot however be edited or deleted.  Only detailed accounts that have the same currency as the vendor’s currency  are available for selection.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Description</strong></dt>
  <dd>The name of the account is displayed in this field.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Entry Type</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select the type of the purchase entry:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>None – this  is the default.</li>
  <li>Taxable Purchase  – the purchase entry is liable to purchase tax.</li>
  <li>Exempt Purchase  – the purchase entry is exempt from taxes.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The automatic Accounts Payable entry defaults  to the entry type “None” and you cannot edit this.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Tax Code</strong></dt>
  <dd>This optional field enables only if you select “Taxable  Purchase” or “Exempt Purchase” in the Entry Type column. If you select  “Taxable Purchase” it displays all active tax codes except those with  the Non-taxable box checked in the tax code profile (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Taxes</strong> &gt; <strong>Tax 
 Codes</strong> &gt; <strong>New/Edit</strong>). If  you select “Exempt Purchase” it displays all active tax codes marked Non-taxable  in the tax code profile.</dd>
  <dt>Tax codes containing a tax component with  the “Amount Recoverable” choice of the “Recoverable” option selected (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Taxes</strong>  &gt; <strong>Tax Components</strong> &gt; <strong>New/Edit</strong>) do not appear in the drop  down box. The “Amount Recoverable” option is based on a unit of measure,  and manual purchase documents do not include measures.</dt>
  <dd>For each taxable entry with a tax code selected,  the system automatically inserts a row beneath the entry for each tax  component of the tax code. If you chose “% Recoverable” in the tax component’s  “Recoverable” option with less than 100%, the system creates a row for  both the recoverable and non-recoverable portions of tax. If you left  the option at 100% only a row for recoverable tax displays; if you did  not select the option only a row for non-recoverable tax displays.</dd>
  <dd>You may manually add entries for the Recoverable  Tax account. If you choose the “Taxable Purchase” entry type, the system  will add the automatic rows and calculate the recoverable and non-recoverable  tax as with any other entry.</dd>
  <dt>If the selected tax code contains only one  tax component, you may edit the tax in the automatically generated Recoverable  and Non-recoverable tax rows or even delete the purchase entry itself  (with adequate security rights). If you edit the tax, the related tax  rows recalculate. If you delete the entry, the system deletes the automatically  added rows. In both cases, however, you must manually change the Accounts  Payable entry if the journal is no longer balanced.</dt>
  <dd>The system-generated Non-recoverable Purchase Tax  rows affect the column information as follows:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Account - defaults  to the account selected as the Taxable Purchase. You may change the account.</li>
  <li>Description  - displays the description of the account. You may not change the description.</li>
  <li>Location/Sub-location  - displays the location/sub-location of the taxable purchase entry. You  may not change the location.</li>

  <li>Job Code -  remains blank. You may not change the job code.</li>

  <li>Credit - column  displays the purchase tax amount if the corresponding taxable amount is  in the Credit column. If the tax code has only one tax component, you  may change the amount or delete the entry and add it to the Debit column.</li>
</ul>

<p>: The system-generated Recoverable Purchase Tax rows  affect the column information as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Account - defaults  to the account selected for the tax component in the Tax Component Profile.  You may change the account.</li>

  <li>Job Code -  remains blank. You may not change the job code.</li>
  <li>Debit - displays  the purchase tax amount if the corresponding taxable amount is in the  Debit column. If the tax code has only one tax component, you may change  the amount or delete the entry and add it to the Credit column.</li>
  <li>Credit - displays  the purchase tax amount if the corresponding taxable amount is in the  Credit column. If the tax code has only one tax component, you may change  the amount or delete the entry and add it to the Debit column.</li>
</ul>
