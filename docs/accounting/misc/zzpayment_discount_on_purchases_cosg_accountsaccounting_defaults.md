Specify the account that must be used to record payment discounts allowed  by your vendor for early settlement of dues. You may select an expense  or revenue account in this field. This field is mandatory if you want  to make a payment on a purchase or purchase return document.


You can use the same payment discount account for both purchases and  sales (path: **Revenue Accounts**  tab > **Payment Discount on Sales** field).

You can only select accounts that have been  set up in the base currency in this tab.
