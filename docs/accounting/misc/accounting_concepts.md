# Accounting Concepts


The four accounting concepts are detailed below:

1. **Business entity 
 concept -** Every business is conceived and treated as an entity  entirely separate from its owners.
- **Going concern 
 concept -** A business will continue its operations indefinitely.  Thus, the assets it uses to run the business are not for sale, and their  market values are not relevant to decision making.
- **Stable currency 
 concept -** The value of the base currency used to measure accounting  transactions does not fluctuate much from period to period. If it does,  such fluctuation is ignored.



{:.example}
If the value of a dollar today is 10% less  than what it was a year ago, assets and liabilities are not devalued to  adjust for the fluctuation.

1. **Time period concept 
 -** Accounting reports the results of operations and financial position  for time periods of equal length.



{:.example}
Calendar year and fiscal year
