# Miscellaneous Payment


Select this option when you want to make a payment to the vendor by  selecting a General Ledger account of your choice, without creating a  purchase invoice.


**&nbsp;**Such  payments are not recorded in the vendor transaction history since the  payment is not associated with any document.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â Purchase  of stamps can be accounted as miscellaneous payments.


When this entry type is selected:

- You cannot  specify a document number (in the **Document 
 #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section) since this is a direct payment for an expense and the  Accounts Payable control account is not credited.
- You can debit  or credit the required account.
