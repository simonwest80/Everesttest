Select a predefined “schedule” from the dropdown list or  create a new schedule and select it.

- To modify or verify  a predefined schedule, select the schedule name from the dropdown list  and click the **Edit** button. You  will see the **Schedule** profile.  If necessary, edit the schedule information in **Schedule**  profile and click the **Save and Close**  button. Be careful when editing existing schedules since they can be assigned  to more than one memorized transaction template.
- To create a new  schedule, click the **New** button.  We recommend creating new schedules if the existing schedules listed do  not meet your needs. You will see the **Schedule**  profile. Enter a unique name for the schedule and the schedule details  in the **Schedule** profile and click  the **Save and Close** button. You  can reuse this schedule for other memorized transactions templates. See  the “Memorized Transactions Template – Schedule Profile” section for information  on how to complete this screen.
