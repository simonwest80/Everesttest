# Deposit on Sales Order


Select this option if you are receiving a deposit on an existing sales order.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Customer deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be credited.
- The **Sales Order** number must be specified in the **Document #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section.
- The **Credit** column automatically displays the balance amount of deposit that can be paid on the order. The balance amount is the difference between the total value of the order and the amount already received as a deposit on the order.
