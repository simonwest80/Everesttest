# Split Payment Journal


You can split journals so that the selected transaction(s)  are moved to a new journal. This option is useful in the following cases:

- When you want  to post only some transactions in a journal; you can then split the journal  and post the required transactions.
- When the journal  that is not posted contains too many transactions, and you want to reduce  the number of transactions contained in the journal.



The original journal must have at least one transaction after splitting.  A new journal is created with the same journal information as the original  journal but with a new journal number.
