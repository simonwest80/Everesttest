Closing balance is calculated based on the reconciliation you make. When this balance tallies with statement balance, the bank account is treated as fully reconciled. This balance is a computed amount. Closing balance is computed using the following formula:


Closing balance = Opening balance + Cleared Receipts - Cleared Payments + Net Adjustment Entries Value
