title: Accounts receivable
---


In **Everest**, all customers do  not have an individual accounts receivable account. Instead, all receivables  are clubbed together under the Accounts Receivable Control Account. Specify  the control account to be used while accounting for customer related transactions.  The **Accounts Receivable Control** account  is an asset account.


{:.note}
You can only select an account that has been  set up in the base currency. You can modify this account only before it  is used in a manual/system accounting entry.
