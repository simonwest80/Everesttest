<p>This field displays the difference between the order total and the deposits.  If the order total was 1000.00 USD (45000 INR) with deposits of 900.00  USD (44500 INR), the Balance field would display 100.00 USD, which is  the order total minus the total deposits. Of course, in the document currency  the field would display 500 INR, which is the 45000 INR total minus the  44500 INR in deposits.</p>

<p>You can think of this value as the amount of money that is still owed  in whichever currency you choose to view. In our example, the base currency  view shows the amount owed in USD and the document currency view shows  the amount owed in INR. When viewed in the base currency (USD), this value  is calculated using the applicable exchange rates of the deposits. However,  this balance may not be the exact amount that you would expect to receive  from the customer because there could be an increase or decrease in the  exchange rate. For a more accurate estimate, refer to the Balance @ Ex.  Rate field.</p>

<p class="note">Even if the total balance of the document  currency has been collected, the Sales Order browser may still display  a balance in the base currency due to the difference in exchange rate.</p>
