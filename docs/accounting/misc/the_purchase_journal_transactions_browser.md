# The Purchase Journal Transactions Browser


The **Purchase Journal Transactions** browser  is displayed when **Options &gt; List Transaction** is selected from the **Unposted 
 Purchase Journals** browser. This browser has the following options:

- **Split 
 Journal** - If a journal that is not posted contains too many transactions,  you may split the journal. Splitting the journal moves the selected transaction(s)  into a new journal.
