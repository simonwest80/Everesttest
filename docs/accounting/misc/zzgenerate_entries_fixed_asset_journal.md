 Date** - Select this option to generate the depreciation entries  upto the transaction  date. A consolidated depreciation entry for all the months from the last  generation date to the current date is created.

If the date of next generation is May 31, 2001,  selecting 'One entry' will create a depreciation entry for $10000. If  the option 'Till date' is selected, then a single depreciation entry would  be created for $50,000 from January to May.
