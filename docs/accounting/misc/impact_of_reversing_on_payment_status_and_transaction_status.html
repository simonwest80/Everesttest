<p>When a transaction is reversed the Transaction Status of the original  transaction will be Reversed and the new transaction status will be Reversal.  Every new re-created entry will have Normal status.</p>

<p>The Payment Status for the reversed and reversal transaction will be  blank and Payment status for the re-created transaction will be <strong>To be Printed</strong> for check payment type  and <strong>Outstanding</strong> for cash or credit  card payment type.</p>

<p class="note">Check number for the new transaction can be  same as the original transaction. However, system will prompt a confirmation  message. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue  assigning same check number.</p>

<p>A Reversed or Reversal transaction can be posted but not edited (except  for the <strong>Narration</strong> field). You  can purge an unposted Reversal transaction, but you cannot void or reverse  it further. Additionally, Reversed or Reversal transactions must be in  an open period to be purged.</p>

<p>You can purge or reverse a recreated transaction because it is a Normal  transaction. Recreated entries appear in the bank reconciliation process  after it is posted or printed but Reversed transactions do not.</p>
