Triangulation Rate


One EMU currency cannot be converted to another EMU by applying the  exchange rate between the two EMU currencies. Triangulation is the process  of converting the amount of the first EMU currency to the Euro and the  amount in Euro to the second EMU currency.


The **Triangulation Rate** is the  rate specified for translating the Euro to the base currency.
