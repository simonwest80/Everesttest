# Miscellaneous Deposit


Select this option if you are receiving a miscellaneous payment (not  on any existing document).


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Security/caution  deposits made by customers can be treated as miscellaneous deposits.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Customer 
 deposit** account specified in the **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be credited.
- A manual **Sales Order** will be created to track  this deposit.



**Everest** does not allow you to  manually enter the document number in the **Document 
 #** column of the **Transaction Entries**  section.


The document number is automatically generated based on the sequence  numbers set up for the login location or the parent location of the login  sub-location and is  prefixed  with an “M”.


If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or the parent  location of the login sub-location, the sequence number assigned to the  default location is assigned to the document. The default location is  specified in the **Accounting** dialog  box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field).
