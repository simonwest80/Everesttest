# The Posted Receipt Journal Payment Method Summary Browser


This browser is displayed when the **Payment 
 Method (Summary)** option (path: **Posted 
 Receipt Journals** browser > **Options**  > **Transactions** > **Payment 
 Method (Summary)**) is selected. The **Posted 
 Receipt Journal Payment Method Summary** browser lists all the payment  methods through which payments have been made by customers or refunds  made to customers, and the net amount debited or credited with each payment  method.


A net credit (indicated by 'CR'  in the **Type** column) denotes that  the payments made through the selected method exceed receipts with that  method. A net debit (indicated by 'DR' in the **Type**  column) denotes that receipts exceed payments.


Options common to all browsers are available in this browser.
