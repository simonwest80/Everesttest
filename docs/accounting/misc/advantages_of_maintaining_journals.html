<p><strong>Everest</strong> creates journals since there are certain advantages of maintaining journals instead of directly posting entries to accounts. These advantages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transactions can be viewed in the chronological order of creation, in its entirety.</li>
  <li>Transactions can be reviewed before posting to the accounts.</li>
  <li>Journals can be printed for the purpose of maintaining an audit trail.</li>
  <li>Different locations can maintain their own set of journals for entry and review.</li>
</ul>
