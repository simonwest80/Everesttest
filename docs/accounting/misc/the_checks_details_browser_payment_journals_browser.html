<h1 id="the-checks-details-browser">The Checks Details Browser</h1>

<p>The <strong>Check Details Browser</strong> is  displayed when checks are selected for printing by selecting the <strong>Print Check(s)</strong>  option from the <strong>Unposted Payment/Receipt 
 Journals</strong> browser. This browser displays details of the bank accounts  from which the payments have to be made. The bank account code and description  cannot be modified.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Check #</strong></dt>
  <dd>Enter the check number from which you want the printing  to commence. By default, the next check number for the bank account selected  in the payment journal is displayed in this field. You can change this  number if required.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" /> <font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font><font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">If a new checkbook has been 
 issued, enter the next check number in this field.</font></dd>
  <dt>If you have issued one of the checks in a series  manually, you will have to enter the next number in this field. For instance,  if you have printed checks upto  check # 2000 and you issue check number 2001 manually, you must enter  2002 in this field when you are issuing the next check.</dt>
  <dd>Checks are printed in order of the transaction number.  Thus the first check will be used for the first transaction, the second  for the next and so on.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Check Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the date of the check in this field. If  the check date has not been specified in the payment journal, this date  will be printed on the check. The check will otherwise be printed with  the date specified in the <strong>Date</strong>  field of the <strong>Check Display Section</strong>  in the payment journal.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Printer</strong></dt>
