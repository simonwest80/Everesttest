# Refund Deposit


Select this option if a deposit received earlier on an existing sales order is being refunded.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Customer deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be debited.
- The **Sales Order** number must be specified in the **Document #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section.
- The **Debit** column automatically displays the amount of deposit on the selected sales order (that has not yet been applied to other documents).
