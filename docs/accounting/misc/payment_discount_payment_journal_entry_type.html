<p>FOR PAYMENT</p>

<p>Select this option if you receive a payment discount from your vendor  on prompt payment of dues.</p>

<p>When you select this entry type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must select  the purchase invoice number in the <strong>Document 
 #</strong> column of the <strong>Transaction Entries</strong> section. Click the Document Lookup button within the Document #  column to bring up a list of all open purchase invoices for the chosen  vendor.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Purchase 
 Discount</strong> account specified in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Defaults</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>COGS</strong> <strong>Accounts</strong>  tab) can only be credited.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Credit</strong>  column automatically displays the value of the discount received from  the vendor. You may change this amount.</li>
</ul>

<p>FOR REFUND</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Payment Discount</strong> entry  type if you receive a refund on a purchase invoice and the discount received  (on the early settlement of dues) must be reversed.</p>

<p>If you select <strong>Refund on Purchase Invoice</strong> as the entry type, and select a purchase invoice on which you have  received a payment discount, a new entry for the ‘Payment Discount’  is automatically displayed. The payment discount received is automatically  displayed as the discount amount to be reversed. You can change this amount  if required.</p>
