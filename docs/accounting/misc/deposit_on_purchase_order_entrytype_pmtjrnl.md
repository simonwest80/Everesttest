# Deposit on Purchase Order


Select this option if you are paying a deposit to the vendor on an existing purchase order.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Purchase Order** number should be specified in the **Document #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section.
- The **Vendor deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be debited.
- The **Debit** column automatically displays the balance amount of deposit that can be paid on the order. The balance amount is the difference between the total value of the order and the amount already paid as a deposit on the order.
