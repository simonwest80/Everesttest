# Provisionally Post Journal(s)


Use this option to provisionally post the highlighted journal. **Everest** will verify that the journals  are balanced and will commence the provisional posting process.


When a journal is provisionally posted, the respective accounts' posted  balances do not change. However, the provisionally posted amount can be  included in the account balance that appears in the financial statements.


When a journal is provisionally posted, new transactions cannot be added  even if its status is **Open**. When  you open a provisionally posted journal, you are informed that it can  be opened only for viewing. In effect, its status is similar to that of  a closed journal. To use the journal, the journal has to be provisionally  un-posted.
