<p>The four accounting concepts are detailed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Business entity 
 concept -</strong> Every business is conceived and treated as an entity  entirely separate from its owners.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Going concern 
 concept -</strong> A business will continue its operations indefinitely.  Thus, the assets it uses to run the business are not for sale, and their  market values are not relevant to decision making.</li>
      <li><strong>Stable currency 
 concept -</strong> The value of the base currency used to measure accounting  transactions does not fluctuate much from period to period. If it does,  such fluctuation is ignored.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="example">If the value of a dollar today is 10% less  than what it was a year ago, assets and liabilities are not devalued to  adjust for the fluctuation.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Time period concept 
 -</strong> Accounting reports the results of operations and financial position  for time periods of equal length.</li>
</ol>

<p class="example">Calendar year and fiscal year</p>
