# Key Accounting Principles


The key accounting principles and how they are applied in **Everest**  are detailed below:

1. **Cost 
 principle -** All goods and services purchased are valued at their  historical cost (i.e., the assets original purchase price) and are displayed  in the financial statements at the cost of acquisition.



****Everest** uses the actual cost to value serialized inventory, and weighted  average cost for valuing non-serialized inventory.**

1. **Objectivity 
 principle -** Accounting data must be as accurate and useful as possible.  It should be documented by objective evidence, usually made in an arm's-length  fashion between a buyer and seller.



**While the relationship between the buyer  and seller is beyond the scope of **Everest**,  all accounting entries are made on creation of a final document.**

1. **Realization 
 principle -** A business records revenue when it ships goods or completes  a service; i.e., when it has done everything needed to complete its part  of the transaction.



****Everest** records sales only when the items have been shipped and simultaneously  reduces inventory for the items shipped.**

1. **Matching 
 principle -** Expenses incurred in generating revenue must be recorded  in the same time period that the revenue is recorded.



****Everest** makes a corresponding entry for cost of goods sold while recording  revenue on sales.**

1. **Materiality 
 principle** - All significant items (items that are valuable enough  to affect decisions made by a user of the financial statements) should  be disclosed in financial statements.



**Disclosures in financial statements are  at the discretion of management and are beyond the scope of any accounting  software. **Everest** provides the  means to obtain information that requires disclosure such as aging of  accounts receivable.**

1. **Full 
 disclosure principle -** Financial statements and their footnotes  must include all relevant accounting information to prevent them from  being misleading.



**Disclosures in financial statements are  again at the discretion of management and are beyond the scope of any  accounting software.**

1. **Consistency 
 principle -** A company must consistently use the same accounting  procedures period after period or inform the reader (of the financial  statements) if the procedures change. This is to ensure comparability  from year to year.

: The consistency principle is most relevant  in valuation of inventories since different methods of valuation can affect  the asset value and expenses. The inventory type determines the method  of item valuation in **Everest**;  serialized inventory is valued at actual cost while non-serialized inventory  is valued at weighted average cost. You cannot change the inventory type  of an item once it has been used.

1. **Conservatism 
 principle -** When faced with uncertainties, accountants must make  estimates that neither unduly overstate nor understate the situation.  If there are multiple ways to record an economic event, you must choose  the one that has the most conservative short term effect. When alternatives  exist for recording economic events the one chosen should result in the  most conservative short term result. Thus, there should be a bias towards  recording a loss or expense, and recording an income or revenue should  be postponed.
