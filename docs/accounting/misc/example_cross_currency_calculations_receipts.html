<p>When more than one currency is involved in a receipt or refund, <strong>Everest</strong> uses cross-currency calculations.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Assume  that your base currency is United States Dollar (USD) and you have created  a sales invoice for a customer whose currency is Great Britain Pound (GBP);  you receive payment from the customer in Euro (EUR), which is deposited  in a bank account maintained in Japanese Yen (JPY). <strong>Everest</strong>  uses cross currency calculations so that your bank account balance will  increase by the JPY amount that equals the value of the EUR check received.</p>

<p>In this case, <strong>Everest</strong>  first uses the exchange rate available for EUR to USD to calculate the  equivalent USD amount for the payment amount. <strong>Everest</strong>  then translates this USD amount to the JPY amount using the exchange rate  available from USD to JPY.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>cross-currency 
 calculations</strong>. The result thus derived is the same as directly translating  EUR to JPY since the exchange rate from EUR to JPY can be obtained by  equating the USD/EUR rate to the JPY/USD rate.</p>

<p>The example given above is illustrated with amounts in the following  example:</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Base  Currency = USD</p>

<p>Amount of payment = 1000 EUR</p>

<p>Exchange rate for EUR to USD: 1 EUR =  0.133935 USD</p>

<p>Bank currency = JPY</p>

<p>Exchange rate for USD to JPY: 1 USD =  123.247 JPY</p>

<p>1000 EUR in terms of JPY = 16507.08 JPY</p>

<p>Document currency = GBP</p>

<p>Exchange rate for GBP  to USD: 1 GBP  = 1.41218 USD</p>

<p>1000 EUR in terms of GBP  = 94.84</p>
