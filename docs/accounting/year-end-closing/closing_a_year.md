# Closing a Year - Pre-requisites


Accounting years should only be closed after the following tasks have  been carried out:

- All purchase,  sales, and general journals, and adjustment entries for the year are created  and posted.
- All account  balances match your income tax returns for the year.
- All periods  for the year are closed.
- A complete  backup of your data is performed.



To ensure that your account balances match your income tax returns for  the year, work with your CPA to enter the various income tax transactions  such as depreciation.


{:.note}
The year end closing process may take several  hours. If any errors occur, an error log will be produced. We recommend  that you work with Everest Software technical support and schedule a time  when they will be available to handle problems.
