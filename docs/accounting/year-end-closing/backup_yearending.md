# Backup


Before closing a period or financial year, you should backup your data.  Consider keeping the backup for file retention (just like paper files,  but less expensive) and for general backup.


**Backing up data is useful for :**

- Restoration  of the previous year's data if the need arises. The cost of backup is  very little when compared to the effort that will be needed to recreate  data.
- Protection  from inadvertent mistakes made in closing or from system failure (due  to power failure, for example) during the closing process. You can reload  your data from the backup and start the process all over again with accurate  information.
