# How do I Schedule Memorized Transactions?


Scheduling your memorized transactions automates retrieving  the templates into the journals for processing. When scheduled, your Accounting  Staff can process the transactions directly from a reminder they receive.  This saves additional time and eliminates the need to learn the template  retrieval process. This is the most effective way to process your memorized  transactions if you know when they should occur ahead of time. This increases  the efficiency of your staff since they do not have to waste time manually  processing transactions that occur on a regular basis.


You can schedule recurring transactions in the General Journal,  Purchase Journal, Payment Journal, Sales Journal, and Receipts Journal.  To schedule recurring transactions, first create a memorized transactions  template and then schedule that template to send reminders to assigned  users. After the assigned user receives the reminder, the user can process  that transaction from the reminder.


{:.example}
A company pays $180 for annual car insurance. They credit  the vendor for $180, debit Prepaid Insurance, and send a check to the  vendor for $180. At the end of each month, in the General Journal, they  must credit Prepaid Insurance and debit Insurance Expense for $15 ($15/month  x 12 months = $180/year). Instead of manually entering these GL transactions  each month, they open a new general journal, add the monthly transactions,  and use the “Memorize Transactions” option to save these as a template  called “Monthly Car Insurance Expense”.


They schedule the “Monthly Car Insurance Expense” template  to send a monthly reminder to an assigned user who processes the transactions  directly from the reminder. This saves them precious time at the busy  end of the month.


You must first create a memorized transactions template before  you can schedule it. Refer to the “How do I Create a Memorized Transactions  Template?” section for information on how to create a template.
