<h1 id="straight-line-method-of-depreciation">Straight Line Method of Depreciation</h1>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> computes depreciation  based on the straight-line method of depreciation. The depreciation entries  can be generated every month, fortnightly or on a quarterly basis, depending  on what accounting periods you defined for your company. You might need  to generate entries more than once during a fiscal year. The Fixed Asset  system keeps track of the last generation date and the number of generations  carried out till that date, for each asset. The flexibility you are given  in calculating the depreciation expense lets you easily manage the fixed  assets for your business.</p>

<p><strong>Straight Line Depreciation</strong></p>

<p>This method has been widely used because of its simplicity and reasonableness.  Under this method, an equal portion of the acquisition cost to be depreciated  is allocated to each period during the useful life. The formula subtracts  the Salvage Value from the Original Value and divides that figure by the  Life of the fixed asset in months. Thus,</p>

<p>Depreciation = (Original Value - Salvage Value)/Life</p>
