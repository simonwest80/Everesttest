<h1 id="depreciation">Depreciation</h1>

<p>Depreciation is the allocation of cost of fixed assets over their useful  life owing to their wear and tear over a period of time. Fixed assets,  with the exception of land, depreciate over time as they are used. Since  their productive usefulness decreases with constant use, their initial  cost is apportioned to expense over their estimated useful life. This  allocation of cost over their useful life is known as depreciation. Land  is not depreciated because it does not wear out like machinery, buildings,  etc.</p>

<p>The amount of depreciation computed for each period is reported on the  income statement as an expense and the cumulative amount of depreciation  expense for all past periods since acquisition is deducted on the balance  sheet from the cost of the asset. Generally, depreciation entries are  generated at the end of each accounting period.</p>

<p>There are a number of depreciation methods that allow you to compute  the depreciation of an asset. <strong>Everest</strong> currently supports the straight-line method of depreciation. Click  <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/fixed-assets/depreciating-an-asset/straight_line_method_of_depreciation.html">here</a> for details.</p>

<p>Within <strong>Everest</strong>, the acquisition  of a fixed asset is handled like the acquisition of inventory and supplies;  that is, through the regular purchasing cycle of quotations, orders, receipts,  and invoices. The fixed asset is initially recorded in the books through  the <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Fixed Assets</strong> menu, while the creation of the depreciation entries  for these fixed assets are handled through the <strong>Accounting 
 &gt; Fixed Asset Journal</strong> menu.</p>

<p>The depreciation journal is recorded as a general journal.</p>
