# Modify Payment Journals


Payment details cannot be modified from the document on which the receipt/refund  was made. However, these details can be modified from the **Payment 
 Journal** profile. You can make such modifications only till the  journal is posted.


The following modifications are possible:

- New transactions  can be added.
- Existing transactions  can be deleted.
- Certain fields  can be modified.



If a manual purchase order is created for entry type 'Miscellaneous  Deposit', then the document number cannot be changed; but the entry can  be deleted. When the amount in an entry is modified, **Everest**  also updates the amounts received against the documents.


If details other than those listed below need to be rectified, you would  have to void the entire payment journal and recreate the entries.
