# Print Payment Journals


You can print payment journals before you post them in order to ensure  that you have a backup. This also acts as an excellent audit trail.


By default, the **Allow user to post 
 a journal even if it is not printed** option in the **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Other** **Flow****Control**) is NOT selected. This  means that you are required to print each journal before you post it to  the ledgers. Although you can select this check box and thereby disable  this requirement, it is not recommended.

You cannot, however, print a voided journal.


{:.steps}
To print a payment journal, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; Account 
 Payable &gt; Payment Journal**. You will see the **Unposted 
 Payment Journals** browser.
- From the **Unposted Payment Journals** browser, highlight  the required journal(s)  and select **Options &gt; Print Journal(s)**.  You will see the **Printing 
 Preferences** dialog box from where you can preview and print  the journals.
- After previewing/printing  the journal, you will see the **Mark selected 
 journals as printed** dialog box. Select **Marked 
 as printed** if the journal has printed correctly or **Abort** to cancel the process.
- If your flow  control preference has been set up to disallow posting until the journal  has been printed, the journal can only be posted if you select the **Marked as printed** option.
