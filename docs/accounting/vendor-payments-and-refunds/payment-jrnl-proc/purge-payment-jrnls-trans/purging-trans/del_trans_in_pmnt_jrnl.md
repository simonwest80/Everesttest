# Purge Transactions - Payment Journal


Transactions can be purged from the **Payment 
 Journal** profile only if the payment journal has not been posted.  A journal is deemed to be purged if all the transactions in the payment  journal are purged.


The transactions that cannot be purged are:

- A transaction  in a posted journal.
- Transactions  for system generated journals.
- An unposted  payment transaction for which a computerized check has been printed.
- A transaction  that was voided from the payment register.
- A transaction  that is a reversal entry for a transaction voided from the payment register.



Purging a payment transaction can be done in three ways:

- From the [**Payment Journal** profile]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/vendor-payments-and-refunds/payment-jrnl-proc/purge-payment-jrnls-trans/purging-trans/del_trans_pmnt_jrnl_profile.html)
- From the [**Payment Journal Transactions** browser]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/vendor-payments-and-refunds/payment-jrnl-proc/purge-payment-jrnls-trans/purging-trans/del_trans_from_pmnt_jrnls_browser.html) ****
- From the [**Payment 
 Register**]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/payment-register/wizard/browser/purging-trans/purging_transactions_from_the_payment_register.html)
