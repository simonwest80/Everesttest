# Purge Payment Journals


Payment journals can be purged if they are unposted. When a journal  is purged:

- All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.
- The journal  appears in the browser with the description 'Purged Journal'.



The following transactions can be purged:

- Unposted transactions.
- Unposted check  payments for which computerized checks have been printed.
- Unposted check  payments where the checks are issued manually.
- Unposted cash,  credit card or other type of payments.
- Unposted refunds  from vendors of any type.



Journals that contain transactions purged from the payment register  or reversal entries for a transaction purged from the payment register  cannot be purged.
