<p>Payment journals can be purged if they are unposted. When a journal  is purged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.</li>
  <li>The journal  appears in the browser with the description ‘Purged Journal’.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following transactions can be purged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unposted transactions.</li>
  <li>Unposted check  payments for which computerized checks have been printed.</li>
  <li>Unposted check  payments where the checks are issued manually.</li>
  <li>Unposted cash,  credit card or other type of payments.</li>
  <li>Unposted refunds  from vendors of any type.</li>
</ul>

<p>Journals that contain transactions purged from the payment register  or reversal entries for a transaction purged from the payment register  cannot be purged.</p>

<p class="steps">To purge a system payment journal, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting &gt; Account 
 Payable &gt; Payment Journal</strong>. You will see the <strong>Unposted 
 Payment Journals</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  required journal.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Purge journal</strong>. You will  see the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The payment journal will be purged. The journal description changes  to ‘Purged Journal’.</p>

<p class="note">If you edit the check number in Payment/Receipt  journal, <strong>Everest</strong> verifies the  check number in the respective journals and also in <strong>Voided 
 Transactions</strong> browser and <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> browser.</p>
