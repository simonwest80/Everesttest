<p>The processes in the back end when a payment journal is purged are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The vendor’s  unposted amount  and net balance is reduced, if the vendor was credited in the purged transaction.  The vendor’s unposted  amount increases, if the vendor was debited.</li>
  <li>
    <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">If the entry type for payment was 'miscellaneous deposit', 
 the manual Purchase Order that was created for the transaction is deleted.</font>
  </li>
  <li>The journal’s  description changes to <strong>Purged Journal</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If payment  discounts were recorded in the purged journal, the <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field on the associated purchase invoice changes based  on the following rules:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field reduces by the amount credited to the purchase discount  account.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field increases by the amount debited to the purchase  discount account.</li>
</ul>
