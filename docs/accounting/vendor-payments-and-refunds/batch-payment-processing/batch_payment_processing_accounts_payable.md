# Batch Payment Processing


Payments made or refunds received from vendors can be accounted for  immediately or in a batch subsequently. The **Batch****Payment Processing** feature (path:  **Accounting** > **Accounts 
 Payable** > **Batch** **Payment Processing**) allows you to process  pending transactions in a batch, instead of processing the payments for  each document individually.


Payment/refund transactions in **Everest**  are recorded in the **Batch Payment Processing 
 - Others** browser, if the **Batch 
 Processing** check box is selected on the **Payment/Refund**/**Collection** dialog box.

In such a case, the accounts payable clerk will select  the **Batch Processing** check box  on the **Payment/Refund**/**Collection**  dialog box. At the end of the day, the supervisor will view the **Batch Payment Processing - Others** browser  and process the accounting entries.


Thus the following transactions may be recorded in the **Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others** browser:

- Payments on  a purchase order or purchase invoice
- Refunds on  a purchase order or purchase invoice
- Collections  on a debit order or debit memo
- Payments on  a debit order or debit memo



{:.note}
Journal entries are not generated when transactions  are transferred to the **Batch** **Payment Processing - Others** browser.  Irrespective of the type of payment method (whether cash, check, etc.),  when the transaction is processed, the payment is recorded in a payment  journal and accounting entries are generated.


{:.steps}
To process the payment/refund/collection  transactions, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting** >  **Accounts** **Payable**  > **Batch** **Payment****Processing**. You will see the [**Batch 
 Payment Processing - Others** browser]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/vendor-payments-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_payment_processing_others_browser_options_ap.html).
- From the **Batch Payment Processing - Others** browser,  select the relevant records.
- Select **Options &gt; Process**.



Once the transaction has been processed successfully, the records are  not displayed in the **Batch** **Payment Processing - Others** browser  anymore.
