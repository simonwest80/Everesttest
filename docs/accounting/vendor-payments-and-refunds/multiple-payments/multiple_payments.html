<p>Multiple Payments is a useful facility that allows multiple payment  entries to be simultaneously created. All purchase invoices and debit  memos that match the selection criteria specified in the <strong>Multiple 
 Payments Wizard</strong> are displayed in the <strong>Multiple 
 Payments</strong> browser. Debit memos and deposits on purchase orders can  be applied to outstanding purchase invoices of a vendor. A single payment  entry is made for each vendor.</p>

<p>You can print or view the <strong>Pre-Check 
 Register</strong> and see if what is selected is acceptable and print the  checks from the payment journal in which the entries are created.</p>

<p>If the selection is not acceptable, you can hold back some checks and  then print the remaining ones. Through such an interactive process, you  can manage the payment process smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The <strong>Multiple Payments Wizard</strong> guides  you through this process. The steps in the wizard are listed in the left  panel of the Wizard.</p>
