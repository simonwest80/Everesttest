# The Multiple Payments Browser


The **Multiple Payments** browser  provides a detailed break up of the vendors and the documents that have  been selected for payment. Documents whose creation date is after the  login date are not included in this browser.


This browser is displayed when the **Finish** button is pressed in the **Multiple 
 Payments Wizard**.


**To select a document for payment:**

- Select the check  box beside the document number.
- All documents can  be selected for payment by selecting **Options 
 &gt; Select All**.
- The **Un 
 Select All** option in the **Options** menu deselects  all the documents.



**A payment transaction is created based on the  following:**

- A transaction is  created for each selected vendor.
- The purchase invoices  are set off against the debit memos in arriving at the amount payable.
- In the case of  manual checks, a transaction is created for all documents (purchase invoices  and debit memos) having the same check number.



Computerized check amounts are automatically consolidated.


If the total amount on debit memos is greater than the total amounts  outstanding on purchase invoices, the excess is presumed to be refunded  by the vendor.


The information available in the **Multiple 
 Payments** browser is categorized under the following heads:

- [Upper  Section]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/upper_section_multiple_payments_browser.html)
- [Document  Details Grid]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/document_details_grid_multiple_payments_browser.html)
