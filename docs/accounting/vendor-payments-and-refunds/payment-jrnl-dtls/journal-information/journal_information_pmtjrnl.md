# Journal Information


Journal information relates to the number, description and fiscal period  for the transaction. This information is common to all transactions in  the journal.


**Journal #**
: This is the unique number used to identify this  journal, and is automatically generated when the details for the first  transaction are saved. You can view other journals by selecting a journal  number from the drop-down list.
: When a new payment journal is created, the number  assigned will be the next number in sequence specified for payment journals  in the **Location** profile (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Accounting** > **Location**/**Sub-Location** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Accounting**  tab > **Payment journal #** field)  of the login location or the parent location of the login sub-location.

: If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or the parent location of the login sub-location, the sequence  number for the default location is assigned to the document. The default  location is specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field).

**Fiscal Year and Period**
: The fiscal year and period for the journal is displayed  in these fields. The transaction date of all accounting entries in the  journal must fall in this period. These fields cannot be modified once  the journal is saved. If you change the period or the fiscal year, the  transaction date and the check date will default to the first date of  the selected period.

**Journal Group**
: This field identifies the group to which the journal  belongs. You can specify only one journal group for all the transactions  in a journal.

**Description**
: The journal description helps the user identify  the nature of transactions in the journal. This description is printed  on all applicable reports.
: **System Entries**
: The description of payment journals in which system  entries (for document payments) are recorded is 'Payment Journals'.
: **Manual Entries**
: For manual entries, this field defaults to "Payment  Journal". You can modify this description as required.

**Bank**
: The bank account code identifies the bank account  for which the payment journal is created. The drop-down menu displays  accounts that have been set up as a bank account in the Chart of Accounts.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) [Bank  Account - Chart of Account Profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/acc-info/coa/chart-of-accounts-details/bank_account.html)
: The payment methods used for transactions in this  journal must all be associated with this bank account.
: When a payment is made on a document, the accounting  entry is created in a payment journal that has the same bank account as  the account that is associated with the payment method.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) [General  Information - Payment Method Profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/payment-information/payment-methods/payment-method-details/general_information_payment_method.html)


**Additional Information**
: Use the **Narration** tab to append notes to the journal such as the reason for creating  the journal or the nature of transactions recorded. Narrations are not  automatically added to system created journals.
