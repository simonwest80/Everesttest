  <dd>When a new payment journal is created, the number  assigned will be the next number in sequence specified for payment journals  in the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In

  <dd>If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or the parent location of the login sub-location, the sequence  number for the default location is assigned to the document.

  <dt><strong>Fiscal Year and Period</strong></dt>
  <dd>The fiscal year and period for the journal is displayed  in these fields. The transaction date of all accounting entries in the  journal must fall in this period.
