  <dd>This field indicates the amount by which the transaction  is out of balance (i.e. the amount of difference between the debits and  credits in the journal), and is automatically computed. If the amount  displayed is positive, the total debits exceed total credits; if the amount  is negative, then total credits exceed total debits.</dd>
