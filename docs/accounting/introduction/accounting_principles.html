<p><strong>Everest</strong> follows ‘Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles’ (GAAP)  when automatically creating accounting entries for sales, purchases, payments,  receipts and loss/gain on foreign currency translations.</p>

<p>GAAP are  rules that govern how businesses measure, process and communicate financial  information. These general principles act as the building blocks for accounting  and help to ensure consistency when reporting accounting information to  other users. Some rules are codified by the Accounting Standards Board  in different countries and are issued from time to time as guidelines  or statements. Other rules are included based on the general knowledge,  conventions and procedures developed over the years by accountants.</p>

<p>‘Generally Accepted Accounting Principles’ include four <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/accounting_concepts.html">underlying  concepts</a> and eight <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/misc/key_accounting_principles.html">key principles</a>.</p>
