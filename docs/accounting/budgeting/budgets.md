# Budgets


The budgets feature allows you to define a budget for each 'Detail'  type of Chart of Account. Furthermore, you can also define this budget  for an accounting period. This feature can be used to compare the budgeted  amount with the actual amount spent in each period.


{:.note}
Since budgets cannot be classified by location,  you must define the total budget for all the location/sub-locations together.


{:.steps}
To create a budget for an account, do the  following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Budget**. You will see the **Budget 
 for Chart of Accounts** browser. This browser lists all the defined  chart of accounts.
- Select **Options &gt; Edit**. You will see the  [**Budget 
 Profile**]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/budgeting/the-budget-profile/the_budget_profile.html).
- Enter the budget  details and click OK. If the account is in foreign currency, you will  see the [**Conversion 
 Rate** dialog box]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/conversion_rate_dialog_box.html).
