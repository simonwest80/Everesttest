# Graphical analysis


**Graphical analysis**


This option gives you a graphical analysis of the budget columns for the selected account type and the current option (the **Balance** or **Activity** option). Select the period range for which you want the analysis. Click on the required graph options. The graph options available are:

- **Current – Budget v/s Actual** - This graph compares the budgeted activity for the accounting periods in the current fiscal year against the actual activity for each period.  The gap between both is the variance.
- **History – Budget v/s Actual** - This graph compares the budgeted activity for the accounting periods in the historical fiscal year selected for comparison against the actual activity for each period.  The gap between both is the variance.
- **Current v/s Historical Variance** - This graph provides a comparison of the variance in the current fiscal year and the historical fiscal year. Variance is the difference between the budgeted and actual figures.
- **Budget – Current v/s Historical** - This graph provides a comparison of the budgeted activity in current fiscal year and the historical fiscal year.
- **Actual – Current v/s Historical** - This graph provides a comparison of the actual activity in current fiscal year and the historical fiscal year.
