<p>The following processes occur in the back end when a manual sales invoice/credit  memo is created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a transaction  is created in a manual sales journal, debiting the customer, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a manual sales invoice by prefixing M  to the document number you specify. Manual sales invoices may be viewed  in the <strong>Sales Invoices</strong> browser  by selecting <strong>View &gt; Summary</strong> from  the browser menu.</li>
  <li>When a transaction  is created in a manual sales journal, crediting the customer, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a manual credit memo by prefixing M  to the document number you specify. Manual credit memos may be viewed  in the <strong>Credit Memos</strong> browser by  selecting <strong>View &gt; Summary</strong> from  the browser menu.</li>
  <li>When the customer  is credited in the manual sales journal, the customer’s unposted  amount viewed in the <strong>Customer</strong>  profile decreases by the amount credited and the net balance decreases.</li>
</ul>
