</ul>

<p class="example">Items such as recycled paper and used furniture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you sell  investments.</li>
  <li>When the amount  received is recurring in nature.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Sub-letting your premises</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you create  credit memos to write off miscellaneous amounts.</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">When you want to write off amounts less than  ten dollars that are outstanding from miscellaneous customers.</p>

<p>Manual sales documents may be viewed in the <strong>Sales 
 Invoices</strong> browser by selecting <strong>View
