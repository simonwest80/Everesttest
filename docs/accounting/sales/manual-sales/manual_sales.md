# Manual Sales


Manual sales journals are created in the following instances:

- When you sell  miscellaneous items that you do not need track inventory for.



{:.example}
Items such as recycled paper and used furniture.

- When you sell  investments.
- When the amount  received is recurring in nature.



{:.example}
Sub-letting your premises

- When you create  credit memos to write off miscellaneous amounts.



{:.example}
When you want to write off amounts less than  ten dollars that are outstanding from miscellaneous customers.


Manual sales documents may be viewed in the **Sales 
 Invoices** browser by selecting **View 
 &gt; Summary**. When a manual sales journal is created, the status  of the journal is by default closed. The document number is prefixed with  an "M"  to denote that it is a manual document.
