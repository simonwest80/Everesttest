<h1 id="sales-documentsmanual-entries">Sales Documents/Manual Entries</h1>

<p>Differences between creating documents and manual entries are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When items are sold through sales invoice or returned through a credit memo, inventory costs and values of the items are affected.  Manual entries affect only the accounts receivable and customer balances.</li>
  <li>Gain or loss on customer returns is automatically calculated when a credit memo is created but it has to be manually calculated and entered when making a manual entry.</li>
</ul>
