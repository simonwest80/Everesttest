# Void System Sales Journals


System sales journals cannot be voided. However errors could occur due to the following reasons:

- The sales invoice/credit memo could have been created for the wrong customer.
- The sales invoice could have been created for the wrong amount.
- The wrong quantity of items could have been shipped.



Such errors can be rectified either by modifying the documents, creating new documents or creating miscellaneous adjustment entries.
