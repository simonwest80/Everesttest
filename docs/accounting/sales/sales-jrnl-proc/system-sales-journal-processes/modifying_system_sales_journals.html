<p>System sales journals cannot be modified. They can only be viewed.</p>

<p>You can modify system journals only by changing the sales invoice or credit memo that created the particular transaction. Changes can be made to a document only till the journal (pertaining to the document) is posted.</p>

<p>When you modify a sales invoice or credit memo, the existing accounting entry is replaced with the accounting entry required for the modified Sales Invoice/Credit Memo. Customer balances are updated accordingly.</p>
