# Purge Manual Sales Journals


Manual sales journals can be purged only if they have NOT been posted.  When you purge a journal:

- All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.
- The journal  ceases to exist.



You cannot purge a sales journal that accounts for manual sales invoices/credit  memos against which a payment has been made/received.
