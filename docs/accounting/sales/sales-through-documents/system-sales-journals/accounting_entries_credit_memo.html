<p>The accounting entry created when items are returned by customers depends  on the inventory type:</p>

  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-ret-docs/cms/create-cm/create-new-cm/accnt-entries/accounting_entry_for_non_inventoried_items_cm.html">Accounting  entry when non-inventoried items are returned</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accounting Entries - Line Items on Documents  Associated to Different Accounts</strong></p>

<p>A Sales Invoice or Credit Memo may consist of more than one line item  with different accounts to be debited for cost of goods sold or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated for each account by accumulating the  amounts for each account.</p>

<p>At the document level you can identify the location or sub-location  to which the income or expense account pertains to in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column of the items details grid.</p>

<p>Since expense and income accounts can be accounted for each location/sub-location  separately, the amounts for such type of accounts are accumulated for  each account and location combination.</p>

<p>If job codes are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated  for each account, location/sub-location and job code combination separately.</p>
