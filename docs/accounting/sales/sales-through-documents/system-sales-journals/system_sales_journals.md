# System Sales Journals


System journals relating to sales and sales returns are created when:

- Sales invoices  are created.
- Credit memos  are created.



A manual transaction cannot be appended to a system sales journal. No  modifications can be made to such journals. You can only view the transactions.


{:.steps}
To view the sales journals, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; Account 
 Receivable &gt; Sales Journal**. You will see the **Unposted 
 Sales Journals** browser. This browser lists all sales journals that  have not yet been posted.
- From the **Unposted Sales Journals** browser, highlight  the required journal and select **Options 
 &gt; List Transaction**. You will see the **Sales Journal Transactions**  browser.
- From the **Sales Journal Transactions** browser,  highlight the required transaction and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**. You will see the [**Sales Journal** profile]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/sales/sales-through-documents/system-sales-journals/system_sales_journal_profile_general.html).
