<p>The accounting entries that are created when sales are made against  documents depend on the inventory type.</p>

<p><strong>Accounting Entries - Line Items on Documents  Associated to Different Accounts</strong></p>

<p>A Sales Invoice or Credit Memo may consist of more than one line item  with different accounts to be debited for cost of goods sold or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated for each account by accumulating the  amounts for each account.</p>

<p>At the document level you can identify the location or sub-location  to which the income or expense account pertains to in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column of the items details grid.</p>

<p>Since expense and income accounts can be accounted for each location/sub-location  separately, the amounts for such type of accounts are accumulated for  each account and location combination.</p>

<p>If job codes are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated  for each account, location/sub-location and job code combination separately.</p>
