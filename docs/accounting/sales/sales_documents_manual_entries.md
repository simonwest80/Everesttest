# Sales Documents/Manual Entries


Differences between creating documents and manual entries are:

- When items are sold through sales invoice or returned through a credit memo, inventory costs and values of the items are affected.  Manual entries affect only the accounts receivable and customer balances.
- Gain or loss on customer returns is automatically calculated when a credit memo is created but it has to be manually calculated and entered when making a manual entry.
