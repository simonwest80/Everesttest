<h1 id="purchasing---documents-manual-entries">Purchasing - Documents/ Manual Entries</h1>

<p>Differences between creating documents and manual entries are listed  below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When items  are received through a purchase receipt, purchased through a purchase  invoice, or returned through a debit memo, inventory costs and values  of the items are affected. Manual entries affect only the accounts payable  and vendor balances.</li>
  <li>Gain or loss  on vendor returns is automatically calculated when a debit memo is created,  but it has to be manually calculated and entered when making a manual  entry.</li>
</ul>
