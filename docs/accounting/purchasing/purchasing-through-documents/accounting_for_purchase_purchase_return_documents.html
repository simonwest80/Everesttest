<p>Purchase entries are entered in an <strong>open</strong>  system purchase journal that fulfills the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The journal  should belong to the same accounting period as the login date.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same journal group as the one selected in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Workstation Settings</strong>)  of the user creating the purchase/purchase return document.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same location/sub-location as the location/sub-location  to which the purchase receipt/ invoice or debit memo belongs.</li>
  <li>The journal  should have the same Accounts Payable Control account as the current <strong>Accounts Payable account</strong> that is selected  in <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Control Accounts</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>

<p>If such an open journal does not exist, a new purchase journal is created.  The number for the new journal is assigned based on the sequence number  defined for purchase journals in <strong>Location</strong>  profile of the login location or the parent location of the login sub-location.  If the login and document location/sub-location are different, the location/sub-location  of the new journal will be the same as that of the document, but the sequence  number for this journal will be generated as per the login location/sub-location.</p>

<p>If sequence numbers are not defined in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile, the sequence number specified for the default location is assigned  to the document. The default location is defined in the <strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab  <strong>&gt; Default Location</strong> field).</p>
