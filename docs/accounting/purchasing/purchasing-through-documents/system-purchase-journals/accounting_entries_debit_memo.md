# Accounting Entries - Debit Memo


The accounting entries that are passed when a debit memo is created  depend on the inventory type of the items purchased.


The accounting entries are categorized under the following:

- [Accounting  entry when inventoried items are returned]({{site.pp_chm}}/misc/entry_for_inventoried_items_dm.html)
- [Accounting  entry when non-inventoried items are returned]({{site.pp_chm}}/misc/entry_for_non_inventoried_items_dm.html)



**Accounting Entries for Documents Containing Line  Items Associated to Different Accounts**


A purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo may consist of more than one  line item with different accounts to be debited for purchase cost or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated by accumulating the amounts for each  account. For expense or income account, amounts are accumulated for common  cost centers or locations/sub-locations for that account. If job codes  are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated for common  accounts, cost centers/sub-locations/locations and job codes.
