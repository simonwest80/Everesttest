<p>The accounting entries that are passed when a debit memo is created  depend on the inventory type of the items purchased.</p>

<p>The accounting entries are categorized under the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/entry_for_inventoried_items_dm.html">Accounting  entry when inventoried items are returned</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/the-purchase-process/misc/entry_for_non_inventoried_items_dm.html">Accounting  entry when non-inventoried items are returned</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Accounting Entries for Documents Containing Line  Items Associated to Different Accounts</strong></p>

<p>A purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo may consist of more than one  line item with different accounts to be debited for purchase cost or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated by accumulating the amounts for each  account. For expense or income account, amounts are accumulated for common  cost centers or locations/sub-locations for that account. If job codes  are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated for common  accounts, cost centers/sub-locations/locations and job codes.</p>
