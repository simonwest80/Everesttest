<p>The processes that occur in the back end when a purchase journal is  posted are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchase invoice  transactions will increase the vendor’s posted amount and reduce the unposted  amount with the net balance of the vendor remaining the same.</li>
  <li>Debit memo  transactions will decrease the vendor’s posted amount and increase the  unposted amount  with the net balance of the vendor remaining the same.</li>
  <li>The period  balances for the account, its parent account and all the accounts higher  than the parent in the COA  hierarchy are updated.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The status  of purchase invoices and debit memos displayed in the status bar of the  document changes to <strong>Posted</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The balance of an account that is an asset  or expense account reduces if it is credited and increases if it is debited.  The balance of an account that is a liability, revenue or capital account  reduces if it is debited, and increases if it is credited.</p>
