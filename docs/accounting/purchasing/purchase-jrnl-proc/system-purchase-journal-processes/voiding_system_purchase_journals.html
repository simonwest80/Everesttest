<p>System purchase journals cannot be voided. However you may need to fix  certain errors that occur due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You could have  created the purchase invoice or debit memo for an amount higher than what  is actually billed to you.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  may estimate the freight incorrectly or the price stated in the vendors  invoice may be lower than what was quoted initially.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purchase  invoice or debit memo may have been created for a lower amount.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  You  may have entered a lower receipt quantity on the purchase invoice.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purchase  receipt/invoice or debit memo may have been created for the wrong vendor.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can rectify such errors by creating new documents, modifying the  documents, or creating miscellaneous adjustment entries.</p>
