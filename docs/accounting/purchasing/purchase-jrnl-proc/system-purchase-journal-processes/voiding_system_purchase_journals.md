# Void System Purchase Journals


System purchase journals cannot be voided. However you may need to fix  certain errors that occur due to the following reasons:

- You could have  created the purchase invoice or debit memo for an amount higher than what  is actually billed to you.



![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  may estimate the freight incorrectly or the price stated in the vendors  invoice may be lower than what was quoted initially.

- The purchase  invoice or debit memo may have been created for a lower amount.



![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  may have entered a lower receipt quantity on the purchase invoice.

- The purchase  receipt/invoice or debit memo may have been created for the wrong vendor.



You can rectify such errors by creating new documents, modifying the  documents, or creating miscellaneous adjustment entries.
