# Accounting for Purchases


Purchase and purchase returns may be accounted either by creating purchase  receipts, purchase invoices, and debit memos or by making manual entries  in purchase journals.


System purchase journals are created:

- To account  for purchase receipts, purchase invoices or debit memos created.
- When payroll  is processed using the US Payroll option.
- When vendor  balances are imported.



Manual purchase journals are created to manually account for purchases  or returns.
