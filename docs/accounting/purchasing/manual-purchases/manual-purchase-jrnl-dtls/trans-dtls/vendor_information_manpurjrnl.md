# Vendor Information


**Vendor**
: This field displays the vendor code which identifies the vendor for the transaction. The vendor's billing address is displayed below this field. The address cannot be edited. The vendor code cannot be modified once the journal is saved.


**On Credit Hold and Credit Limit**
: These fields display whether the vendor has put you on credit hold and the credit limit allowed by the vendor. The 'credit limit' and 'on hold status' is the current credit limit and hold status and not the limit at the time of creating the document.
: These details are automatically displayed from the **Vendor** profile (path: **Purchasing** > **Vendors** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window** > **Accounting** tab). The credit limit is displayed in the vendor's currency.
