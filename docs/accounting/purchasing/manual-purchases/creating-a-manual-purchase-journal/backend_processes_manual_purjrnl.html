<p>The following processes occur in the back end when a manual purchase  invoice/debit memo is created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When a transaction  is created in a manual purchase journal crediting the vendor, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a manual purchase invoice by prefixing ‘M’  to the document number you specify. Manual purchase invoices may be viewed  in the <strong>Purchase Invoices</strong> browser  by selecting <strong>Options &gt; Include manual</strong> from the browser menu.</li>
  <li>When a transaction  is created in a manual purchase journal debiting the vendor, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a manual debit memo by prefixing ‘M’  to the document number you specify. Manual debit memos may be viewed in  the <strong>Debit Memos</strong> browser by selecting  <strong>Options &gt; Include Manual</strong> from  the browser menu.</li>
  <li>When the vendor  is credited in the manual purchase journal, the vendor’s unposted  amount viewed in the <strong>Vendor</strong> profile  increases by the amount credited and the net balance increases.</li>
</ul>
