<p>Journal information relates to the number, description and fiscal period  for the transaction. This information is common to all transactions in  the journal.</p>

  <dd>When a new receipt journal is created, the number  assigned is the next sequence number specified for receipt journals in  the <strong>Location</strong> profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In

 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab <strong>&gt; Default Location</strong> field).</dd>
