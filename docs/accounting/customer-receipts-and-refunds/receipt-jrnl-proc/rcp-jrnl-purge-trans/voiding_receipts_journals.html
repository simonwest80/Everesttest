<p>Receipt journals can be purged only if they have not been posted. When  a journal is purged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.</li>
  <li>The journal  appears in the browser with the description ‘Purged Journal’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Journals containing the following transactions can be purged:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Posted transactions.</li>
  <li>Refund transactions  for which computerized checks have been printed.</li>
  <li>Unposted check  payments where the checks are issued manually.</li>
  <li>Unposted cash,  credit card or other type of payments.</li>
  <li>Unposted refunds  to customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Journals that contain transactions purged from the payment register  or reversal entries for a transaction purged from the payment register  cannot be purged.</p>

<p class="steps">To purge a receipt journal, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting &gt; Account 
 Receivable &gt; Receipt Journal</strong>. You will see the <strong>Unposted 
 Receipt Journals</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From <strong>Unposted Receipt Journals</strong> browser, highlight  the required journal.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Purge journal</strong>. You will  see the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The receipt journal will be purged. The journal description changes  to ‘Purged Journal’.</p>

<p class="note">If you edit the check number in Payment/Receipt  journal, <strong>Everest</strong> verifies the  check number in the respective journals and also in <strong>Voided 
 Transactions</strong> browser and <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> browser.</p>
