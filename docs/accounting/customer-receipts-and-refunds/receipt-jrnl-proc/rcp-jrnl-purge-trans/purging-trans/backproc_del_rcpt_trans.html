<p>The back end processes that occur when a receipt transaction is purged  are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer’s  unposted amount  and net balance increases, if the customer was credited in the voided  transaction; the customer’s unposted  amount decreases, if the customer was debited in the voided transaction.</li>
  <li>If the entry  type for payment was a miscellaneous deposit, the manual sales order created  for the transaction is purged.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If payment  discounts were recorded in the purged transaction, the <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field on the associated sales invoice changes based on  the following rules:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field reduces by the amount debited to the sales discount  account.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field increases by the amount credited to the sales discount  account.</li>
</ul>
