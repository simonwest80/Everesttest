# Purge Transactions - Receipt Journal


Transactions can be purged from the **Receipt 
 Journal** profile only if the receipt journal has not been posted.  A journal is deemed to be voided if all the transactions in the receipt  journal are voided. Its status changes to 'Voided Journal'.


The receipt/refund transactions that cannot be purged are:

- Transactions  in a posted journal.
- Transactions  for system generated journals.
- An unposted  refund transaction for which a computerized check has been printed.
- A transaction  that was voided from the payment register.
- A transaction  that is a reversal entry for a transaction voided from the payment register.
