<p>Everest does not allow you to post a journal which is not balanced (the  total credits do not equal the total debits). If there are short/over  amounts the journal will not post. In this case, simply balance the journal  In addition, several other conditions will prevent the journal from posting.  See the <strong>Remarks</strong> descriptions in  the <strong>Journal Posting Results</strong> information.</p>

<p>We recommend that you print and review each journal before posting it,  although by default Everest will let  you  post a journal without printing it first. You can deselect the preference  <strong>Allow user to post a journal even if 
 it is not printed</strong> to prevent Everest from posting an unprinted  journal. Make this change in the Other Flow Control preferences (path:  <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow 
 Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other Flow Control 
 &gt; General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When Everest posts a journal, the respective chart of accounts updates  with the transactions contained in the journal. In the case of foreign  currency documents, the account balances update in both base and foreign  currency.</p>
