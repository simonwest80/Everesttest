<p>The back end processes that occur when a receipt journal is posted are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receipts will  decrease the customer’s posted amount and increase the unposted  amount, with the net balance remaining the same.</li>
  <li>Refunds will  increase the customer’s posted amount and decrease the unposted  amount, with the net balance remaining the same.</li>
  <li>The period  balances for the account, its parent account and all the accounts higher  to the parent in the COA hierarchy are updated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The balance of an account that is an asset  or expense account reduces if it is credited, and increases if it is debited.  The balance of an account that is a liability, revenue or capital account  reduces if it is debited, and increases if it is credited.</p>
