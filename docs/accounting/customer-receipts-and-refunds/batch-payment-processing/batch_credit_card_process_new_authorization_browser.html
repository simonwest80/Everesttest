<p>Credit card transactions with type “Authorize”, “Book”  or “Sale or Authorize” are recorded in the <strong>Batch 
 Payment Process – New Authorizations</strong> browser (path: <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> <strong>Receivable</strong>  &gt; <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment</strong><strong>Processing</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong><strong>Authorization</strong>).</p>

<p>The following transactions are also displayed in this browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web orders  whose payment method is associated with a Payflow  Pro or Saferpay processor.</li>
  <li>Sales Orders  that are imported with the payment preference set to “Credit card  authorized for payment”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Process Transactions</p>

<p>When you process these transactions (path: <strong>Batch</strong><strong>Payment Process</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Process</strong>),  the credit card transaction is first authorized. The transaction type  will be changed to ‘Capture’.</p>

<p>These transactions are then displayed in the <strong>Batch 
 Payment Process– Prior Authorizations</strong> browser. If however, you  reduce the Payment Amount, and the document continues to have a balance  after the transaction is processed, the remaining payment amount continues  to be displayed in the browser so that you can process it later.</p>

<p class="example">If the authorization transaction is for $1000,  and you process only $750 due to lack of funds, the transaction continues  to be displayed in the browser with a payment amount of $250 (1000-750).</p>

<p>No accounting entries are created when “Pre-Authorization”  type of transactions are processed.</p>
