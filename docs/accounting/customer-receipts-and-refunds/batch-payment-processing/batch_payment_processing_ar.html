<p>Payments received or refunds made can be processed online or in a batch  subsequently. The <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment Processing</strong> feature (path: <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts 
 Receivable</strong> &gt; <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Payment Processing</strong>) allows you to process  pending credit card/cash/check transactions in a batch, instead of processing  the payments for each document individually. Address and CVV2 verification  is also carried out, as required, when you process credit card transactions  using this option.</p>

<p>Transactions recorded in the <strong>Batch 
 Credit Card Processing</strong> browser may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/transactions_created_in_everest.html">Transactions  created in Everest</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/transactions_created_in_everest_e_commerce.html">Transactions  created in Everest eStorefront</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are four types of <strong>Batch Credit 
 Card Processing</strong> browsers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_new_sale_or_refund_browser.html">New  sale or refund</a></li>
