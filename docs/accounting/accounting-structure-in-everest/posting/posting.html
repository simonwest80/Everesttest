<h1 id="the-posting-process">The Posting Process</h1>

<p>Posting is the process of transferring journal entries to appropriate  ledger accounts. Thus posting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transfers journal  entries to the related ledger accounts.</li>
  <li>Distributes  the entries permanently to the accounts.</li>
  <li>Permanently  closes the journal from where the entries originated. No further additions  or modifications of transactions can occur for that journal. If another  transaction is needed for the period, you must create a new journal.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  deposits are received, the respective cash and receivable accounts are  updated when the journal is posted. The journal in which the deposit was  recorded is transferred to the <strong>Posted 
 Receipt Journals</strong> browser.</p>

<p>Authentic Trial Balances, Balance Sheets and Profit &amp; Loss reports  can be obtained only when all the transactions are posted.</p>

<p>You must manually post all journals in <strong>Everest</strong>.  However, adjustment entries created during the bank reconciliation process  are automatically posted when you complete the reconciliation and save  it.</p>
