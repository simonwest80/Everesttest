# Tasks Prior to Posting


You are advised to carry out the following tasks prior to posting journals:

- **Review 
 transactions prior to posting** - All transactions should be reviewed  before posting, and all journals must be balanced.



![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  **Everest**  checks whether the accounts used are valid or not. You must confirm whether  they are they are the right accounts by reviewing the journal.


You can print to paper or a file to help  with your review process.


It is easy to locate and correct mistakes  at this stage. Only manual journals, and payment and receipt journals  can however, be directly modified/deleted before posting. You can adjust  system-generated transactions only by creating new documents or miscellaneous  journal entries.

- **Print 
 journals prior to posting** - Even though the general ledger reflects  the effect of new transactions that are posted, it is preferable to print  a final version of each journal before posting. This will be an excellent  source of audit trail and will also act as a backup.



![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  **Everest**  allows you to set a preference to **Allow 
 user to post a journal even if it is not printed** in **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Other 
 Flow Control**). If this preference is not selected, a journal that  has not been printed cannot be posted.


By default, this option is selected so that  you can post the journal without printing it. It is recommended that journals  be reviewed before posting.
