# Default Accounts


**Everest** automatically creates  accounting entries when:

- A final document  for purchase, purchase returns, sales, sales returns or inventory adjustments  is created.
- Payments or  receipts are recorded against these documents.



To facilitate the automation process, default accounts can be specified  for all the accounts that are used in a transaction. The default accounts  are specified in the **Posting 
 Group** profile (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Posting Group** profile).


Posting Groups can be defined at the company level.

In the Accounting defaults where you have defined default accounts for  the company, select at least one set of default Posting Groups of each  type (Customer, Vendor, Inventory, or Fixed) that you have specified in  **Posting Group** profile. Apart from  defining Posting Groups for the company, you an define Posting Groups  at the location level and also associate these Posting Groups to Customer,  customer class, Vendor, Vendor class, Item and Item category.


Default accounts are also required for unreconciled differences, crediting/debiting  net income/loss on closing the year and foreign currency translation gain/loss.


Default accounts can also be selected in the **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting**).
