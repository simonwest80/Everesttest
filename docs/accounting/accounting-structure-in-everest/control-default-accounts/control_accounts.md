# Control Accounts


Control accounts comprise individual balances of all related accounts.


{:.example}
The Inventory Control Account comprises the  values of all items in inventory.


Control accounts are used:

- **For 
 feasibility** - When it is impractical to maintain a ledger account  for each related item.



{:.example}
Maintaining an inventory account for each  item in stock would lead to a large COA.

- **For 
 better financial analysis** - Control accounts ensure that all related  items are routed through one account. This helps better financial analysis.



{:.example}
Accountants frequently use financial ratios  such as Stock Turnover and Working Capital Ratio that require the total  value of inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Using a  control account for these ensures that all relevant account balances are  included in the analysis.

- **To 
 prevent errors** - Identifying control accounts ensures that important  items of expenditure/revenue are accounted correctly.



{:.example}
Identifying the inventory control will ensure  that inventory is not accounted in any account other than the identified  asset account.

- **For 
 faster processing -** Control accounts facilitate automatic processing  of transactions as the user does not have to manually select an account  every time the control account is affected.
