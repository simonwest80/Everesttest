# Find Account Activity


The **Find Account Activity** filter  is used to find the activity in any ledger account (including discontinued  accounts). This is particularly useful when you need information online  and do not wish to print the detailed ledger account.

The search yields the entire activity or  changes in the Inventory Control account for the selected period.


The search yields the **Account Activity**  browser with the following fields:

- General Ledger  Account
- Current Balance
- Account Type
- Dates
- Transaction  Grid
