# Account Remeasurement


If your company has assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign  currencies, accounting regulations and guidelines of the principal accounting  body in your country may require you to remeasure these assets and liabilities  at the exchange rate prevailing on the Balance Sheet date.

**Everest** provides you a wizard  that guides you though the process of remeasuring foreign currency balances  of assets, liabilities, capital, customers and vendors.

Balances posted till  the date of remeasurement are only considered for remeasurement.
