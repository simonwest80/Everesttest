<p>The impact of fluctuation in exchange rate for foreign currency asset  account balances is measured by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Converting  the current foreign currency balance of the asset account to base currency  using the exchange rate for the currency entered in the <strong>Exchange 
 Rates</strong> section.</li>
  <li>The current  converted balances in base currency of all asset accounts are totaled.</li>
  <li>The balance  in base currency of these accounts is deducted from the current converted  balance. If the result is positive, there is a gain on remeasurement.  If the result is negative, there is a loss on remeasurement.</li>
</ul>
