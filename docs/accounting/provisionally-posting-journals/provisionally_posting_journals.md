Provisional posting allows you to generate financial statements such  as the income statement, balance sheet and trial balance considering the  impact of the provisional postings. You can also obtain these statements  without considering provisional posting.

 even if it is not printed** in the **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control**)  is not selected, you cannot post a journal unless it has been printed.
