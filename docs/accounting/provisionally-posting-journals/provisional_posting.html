<p>The accounting process in <strong>Everest</strong>  involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating accounting  entries in journals (manual or system) for the accounting period to which  the transaction relates.</li>
  <li>Closing the  journal.</li>
  <li>Posting the  journal by which the accounting entries are posted to the account.</li>
</ul>

<p>The account balances are updated when a journal is posted.</p>

<p>After posting a journal, it is not possible to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add transactions  to it</li>
  <li>Modify the  journal</li>
  <li>Modify documents  related to the journal - Accounting entries are created when final documents  are created or deposits are received/ paid. If these accounting entries  are posted, the documents cannot be modified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Posting journals in <strong>Everest</strong>  thus follows the batch posting method. Posting requires user intervention.  Although batch postings has the advantage of giving the user time to review  transactions and make modifications before posting it to the accounts,  the disadvantage is that the account balances are not up-to-date.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/img/example.gif" alt="" />  A  user may have created payment and receipt entries affecting a bank account,  but the user has no means of knowing the current balance in the bank account  without posting it. The user may want to review payment entries before  posting it, and also want to know the current balance after considering  the effect of all the new entries made.</p>

<p>Provisional posting offers the benefit of both batch posting and real  time posting. Even though the account balances are not updated with the  provisionally posted amounts, you can generate financial statements that  include these amounts.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides you with the  <strong>Provisional Posting</strong> utility that  allows you to provisionally post selected journals.</p>
