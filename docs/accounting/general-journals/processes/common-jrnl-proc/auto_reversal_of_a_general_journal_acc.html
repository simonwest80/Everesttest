<p>The Auto Reversal feature is used when you wish to reverse  a General Journal and you know that you are going to reverse the transaction  in advance. You can schedule an auto reversal with an automatic Reminder/Snooze  that appears on your Desktop, scheduled to your convenience and process  the reversal of the General Journal with one-click from the Reminder.</p>

<p>An auto reversal is scheduled for a General Journal entry  with the intent to reverse it sometime later. <strong>Everest</strong>  will handle the creation of the reversing entry with a Scheduled Transaction.</p>

<p class="example">A supplier sends inventory to a Retail store  on 12/26/2007, but will send the invoice in 4-5 days. The supervisor at  the Retail store has received the inventory and would like to keep his  record books up to date. The supervisor has an estimate for the cost of  the goods supplied as $5000; he records the transaction and schedules  a reminder for 12/28/2007. He later processes the transaction from the  reminder that he receives with a one-click operation.</p>
