# Foreign Currency Translations


When the document currency is a foreign currency, the amounts in foreign  currency are translated into the base currency using the exchange rate  for the document.


The translation formula applied depends on the quote type.


**Where the quote type is Foreign to Base, the  translation formula is:**


Foreign Currency Amount \* (Exchange Rate/Quote Amount)


**Where the quote type is Base to Foreign, the  translation formula is:**


Foreign Currency Amount \* (Quote Amount /Exchange Rate)


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â If  your base currency is the US Dollar and the currency of the account is  Great Britain Pounds (GBP), and the rate is expressed as 1 GBP = 1.42064;  then 1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote type foreign to  base as 1000\* (1.42064/1) = 1420.64.


If the rate is expressed as 1 USD = 0.703973  GBP, then 1000 GBP is translated using the formula for quote type base  to foreign as 1000\* (1/0.703973) = 1420.64.
