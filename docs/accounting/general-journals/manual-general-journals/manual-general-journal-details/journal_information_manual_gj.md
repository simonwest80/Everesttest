# Journal Information


Journal information relates to the number, description and fiscal period  for the transaction. It is common to all transactions in the journal.


**Journal #**
: This is the unique number used to identify the journal  and is automatically generated when the details for the first transaction  are saved. You can view other journals by selecting a journal number from  the drop-down list.
: When a new general journal is created, the number  assigned is the following number in sequence specified for general journals  in the login location or the parent location of the login sub-location.  The sequence numbers are specified in the **Location**  profile (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Location**/**Sub-Location** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Accounting**  tab > **General journal #** field).

: If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or the parent location of the login sub-location, the sequence  number assigned to the default location is assigned to the document. The  default location is specified in the **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field).

**Fiscal year and period**
: The fiscal year and period for the journal is displayed  in these fields. The transaction date of all accounting entries in the  journal must fall in this period. These fields cannot be modified once  the journal is saved.


**Journal group**
: This field identifies the group to which the journal  belongs. You can specify only one journal group for all the transactions  in a journal. This field may be left blank.


**Description**
: The journal description helps the user identify  the nature of transactions in the journal. This description is printed  on all applicable reports.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â When  creating a general journal to adjust balances during the process of closing  a fiscal year, you can enter the description as 'Year end adjustment entries'.


**Additional Information**
: You may append notes to the journal such as the  reason for creating the journal or the nature of transactions recorded  in the **Narration** tab of the **General Journal** profile. You can enter  only one narration for all the transactions in the journal.
