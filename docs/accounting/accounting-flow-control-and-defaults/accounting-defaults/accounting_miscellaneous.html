</dl>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Due 
 from the customer against any dues by you to the customer</strong> - Dues  from a customer are the balance to be paid on a sales invoice and the  amount to be paid as a deposit on a sales order. Dues to a customer are  the amount to be paid as deposit on a credit order and the amount to be  refunded on a credit memo.</li>
  <li><strong>Due 
 by you to a vendor against any dues from the vendor</strong> - Dues to a  vendor are the balance to be paid on a purchase invoice and the amount  to be paid as a deposit on a purchase order. Dues from a vendor are the  amount to be paid as deposit on a debit order and the amount to be refunded  on a debit memo.</li>

</dl>

<p class="example">A cashier gave an employee a $50 bill from  the cash drawer to buy pizza for the staff. At the end of the day, the  pizza bill was only $ 43.50 and so the balance of $6.50 was placed back  into the drawer. In the Bank Deposit Wizard, when the cash deposit was  being prepared, an adjustment of ($43.50) was expensed to an entertainment  account.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Default adjustment account for payment type ‘Check’</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the default adjustment account for check  payments.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Default adjustment account for payment type ‘Others’</strong></dt>
  <dd>Specify the default adjustment account for payment  by other methods, excluding cash and check.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="example">A merchant needs to pay 15 cents for each  transaction using a VISA card. The merchant calculates the VISA receipts  on a particular day to be 10 transactions amounting to $1000. The transaction  fee that will be deducted from the bank account is $1.50. The merchant  selects an expense account (VISA transaction fee account) and enters this  amount as ($1.50).</p>
