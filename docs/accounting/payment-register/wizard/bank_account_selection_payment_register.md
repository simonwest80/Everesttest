# Bank Account Selection


This section allows you to specify the account code of the bank account  for which you want to generate the Payment Register.


The drop-down lists only those bank accounts that have been set up as  a bank account in the chart of accounts. Selecting the bank account code  automatically displays the balance of the said account in the **Balance**  section. To proceed, it is mandatory to select a bank account in this  section.


Click **Next**. You will see the  [**Vendor/Customer 
 Selection** section]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/payment-register/wizard/vendor_customer_selection_payment_register.html).
