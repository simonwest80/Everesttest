 Register Wizard</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Payments Register</strong> browser  has the following columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Reference 
 # / Check # -</strong> The reference number or check number specified for  the payment or receipt is displayed in this column. If the payment is  through credit card the reference # appears or if the payment is through  check the check # appears. Credit card numbers in the Reference # column  are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last four="" digits="" of="" the="" card="">  when the **Enable Extended Mode**  check box is cleared (path: **File**  &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Preferences**  &gt; **Workstation Settings** &gt;  **Company Settings** tab). This column  is editable if the transaction is unposted or the payment status is **Outstanding** or **To 
 be Printed**.</last></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you want to edit the data then you have  to blank out the entire data, which is possible only for transactions  that have <strong>Outstanding</strong> status.</p>

<p class="example">Suppose the Check # assigned to Transaction  #1 in <strong>Outstanding</strong> status is 1234.  If you want to change the Check # to 1238 you have to blank out the Check  # column for this transaction. As you blank out the Check # the payment  status changes to <strong>To-be-printed</strong>.  After keying in the Check # the payment status automatically changes to  <strong>Outstanding</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Date</strong> - The date that the payment was issued or received is displayed  in this column.</li>
  <li><strong>Amount</strong>  - The amount of the payment is displayed in this column.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment</strong><strong>Method</strong> - The payment method by  which the vendor was paid or the payment was received from the customer  was paid is displayed in this column.</li>

  <li><strong>Narration</strong>  - This column is updated with the reason provided for voiding/reversing  a check in the <strong>Narration</strong> section  of the <strong>Void</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>Accounting &gt;</strong> <strong> Payment 
 Register</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Void</strong>).</li>
  <li>Transaction  Status - This field indicates whether  the transaction used is a Normal transaction, Voided transaction, Reversed  transaction or Reversal transaction.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Transactions recreated after voiding or reversing  are marked as Normal transaction.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deposited</strong>  - You can add this column to the Payments Register from the Field Chooser.  The <strong>Deposited</strong> column displays  a checkmark if a payment has been deposited. Change the deposit status  by selecting <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Change Deposit Status</strong> &gt; <strong>Mark 
 Deposit/Clear Deposit</strong> from the right-click menu or from the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</li>
</ul>

<p class="warn">Warning: If the deposit status is marked <strong>‘Deposited’</strong>  in the Payments Register browser, the receipt will not be listed in the  <strong>Bank Deposit Wizard</strong> even if the  receipt is still undeposited and vice versa. Be extremely cautious while  marking a payment as deposited in the <strong>Payments 
 Register</strong> browser; it is a good practice to restrict security rights  for changing the deposit status in this browser only to authorized personnel.</p>
