<p>The back end processes when a payment transaction is purged or voided  from the Payment Register are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The vendor’s  unposted amount and net balance is reduced, if the vendor was credited  in the voided transaction; the vendor’s unposted amount increases, if  the vendor was debited in the voided transaction.</li>
  <li>If the entry  type for payment was ‘miscellaneous deposit’,  the amount on the manual purchase order created for the transaction is  zeroed out.</li>
  <li>If all transactions  in the journal are deleted, the journal’s description changes to “Voided  Journal”.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If payment  discounts were recorded in the purged/voided transaction, the <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field on the associated purchase invoice changes based  on the following rules:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field reduces by the amount credited to the purchase discount  account.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Payment 
 Discount</strong> field increases by the amount debited to the purchase  discount account.</li>
</ul>
