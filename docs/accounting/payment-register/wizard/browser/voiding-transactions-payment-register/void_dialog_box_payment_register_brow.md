**Replace voided transaction with new transaction**

New Transaction Information


The fields in this section are only available if you have selected the  **Replace voided transaction with new transaction**  check box.


**Source Type**
: This field will display the source type from the  original transaction. However, you can select a different source type  from the drop-down list or create a new one. The description will display  in the untitled field to the right. This field is mandatory.


{:.note}
- Since the narration  specified does not get printed on the customer and vendor statements,  we recommend that you specify the source type to indicate the exact reason  for voiding.
- By default system  source type will appear. Clicking the drop down lists all manual source  types. To get back to system source type, you have to close and re-open  the **Void** dialog box.


**Bank Account**
: Use this drop-down list to select the bank account  to use. This field is required. The bank account of the original transaction  will automatically default if no bank account is specified while saving  this profile.


**Payment Method**
: This field will display the payment method from  the original transaction. However, you can select a different payment  method from the drop-down list or create a new one. The description will  display in the untitled field to the right. If no payment method is selected,  the payment method of the original transaction will display when you save.


**Date**
: This field defaults to the date of the original  transaction, but can be changed to another date.


{:.note}
The date selected must fall within an open  period. If you select a date other than the default, it must fall on or  after the date of the original transaction.
