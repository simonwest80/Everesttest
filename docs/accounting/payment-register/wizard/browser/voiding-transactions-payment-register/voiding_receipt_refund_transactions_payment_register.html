<p>Voiding transactions from the payment register is different from purging  transactions. When a transaction is voided from the payment register,  the transaction balance is set to $0.00 and the customer or vendor associated  with the transaction is removed. When a transaction is purged, the transaction  is deleted from Everest permanently and all references to the purged transaction  are removed.</p>

<p class="example">If a payment transaction is purged from the  <strong>Unposted Payment Journal</strong>, this  transaction is no longer referenced in the <strong>Unposted 
 Payment Journal</strong>, <strong>Journal Transaction</strong>  browser, <strong>Payment Register</strong>, <strong>Document Payment History</strong>, or <strong>Event 
 History</strong>.</p>

<p>You can void a transaction from the <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> or from the documents through the <strong>Payment 
 History</strong> screen. You can also recreate the voided transaction, if  necessary. The following procedures can be completed using the <strong>Void</strong>  option:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Void 
 a Transaction</strong> - In this case, the transaction balance is set to  $0.00, the customer/vendor associated with the transaction is removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Void 
 and Recreate a Transaction</strong> - In this case, the transaction balance  is set to $0.00, the customer or vendor associated with the transaction  is removed, and a new transaction is recreated to replace the voided entry.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To void/void and recreate transactions from  the Payment Register, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt;  <strong>Payment Register</strong>. You will see  the <strong>Payment Register Wizard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Specify the  details and click <strong>Finish</strong> to view  the <strong>Payments Register</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  required transaction and select <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Void</strong>. You will see the <strong>Void</strong>  dialog box.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Void</strong> option is available  for all UNPOSTED transactions irrespective of whether checks have been  printed or not.</p>

<p>The <strong>Void</strong> option is not available  for the following transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reversed</li>
  <li>Reversal</li>
  <li>Already Voided</li>
  <li>Cleared/Reconciled</li>
</ul>

<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> to void the check and  return to the <strong>Payment Register</strong>  browser.</p>
