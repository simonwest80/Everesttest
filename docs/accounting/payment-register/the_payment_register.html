<p>The <strong>Payment Register</strong> browser  lists details of payments and receipts such as the amount of payment/receipt,  the customer from whom the payment was received, the vendor to whom the  payment was made, the payment method and reference information.</p>

<p>The <strong>Payment Register</strong> browser  is generated based on the parameters specified in the <strong>Payment 
 Register Wizard</strong>. A <strong>Payment Register</strong>  browser is created for payments and receipts from a selected bank account,  for transactions with customers, vendors or both, for selected payment  methods and for a selected period.</p>

<p>From the <strong>Payment Register</strong> browser,  checks can be voided and related documents can be listed.</p>

<p class="note">Only transactions that have resulted in a  debit or credit to the bank account are listed. If, for instance, a payment  is made to apply a deposit on an order to an invoice and the amount of  debit or credit to the bank account is zero, the entry will not be displayed  in the payment register and this entry cannot be voided.</p>

<p>The <strong>Payment Register Wizard</strong> takes  you through the process of generating the <strong>Payment 
 Register</strong> browser. The steps in this wizard are listed in the left  panel.</p>

<p class="steps">To view the Payment Register, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Accounting &gt; Payment 
 Register</strong>. You will see the<a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/payment-register/wizard/the_payment_register_wizard.html"><strong>Payment Register Wizard</strong></a>.</li>
