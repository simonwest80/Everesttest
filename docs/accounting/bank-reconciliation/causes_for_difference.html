<h1 id="causes-for-difference">Causes for Difference</h1>

<p>The most common causes of differences between the bank balance as per  the bank statement and your records are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Outstanding 
 checks</strong> - These checks have been issued by you but have not yet  been charged to your bank account. Such checks may be determined by comparing  the bank statement with a record of the checks issued. A list of checks  issued may be obtained from the Payment Register.</li>
  <li><strong>Deposits 
 in transit</strong> - These are deposits made by you that have not yet been  credited to your bank account, i.e. the bank has not yet recorded the  deposit. This sometimes happens when deposits are made one or two days  before the statement is received. Such deposits are determined by comparing  the deposits listed in the bank statement with copies of the deposit slips  retained and/or the receipts journal.</li>
  <li><strong>Bank 
 service charges</strong> - These are service charges paid by you to the  bank for items such as NSF  checks written either by the company or received from a customer, monthly  account maintenance charges, etc. These may be charged to the bank account  without you being aware of the same.</li>
  <li><strong>Errors</strong> - Both the bank and a company are susceptible to errors, especially  when the volume of bank transactions is large.</li>
</ul>
