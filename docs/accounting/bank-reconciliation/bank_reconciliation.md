# Bank Reconciliation


Bank reconciliation is the act of comparing your bank account with the bank statement, locating the differences and adjusting or settling the difference to bring them in agreement or at least understand and document the differences between the two.


In other words, the payments made and the payments received in **Everest** should agree with the bank statement. Bank reconciliation thus has two accounting purposes:

- To reconcile the closing bank balance (as per the bank statement) with the bank balance as per your records.
- To arrive at the correct balance of the bank account for reporting in the balance sheet.



You can carry out bank reconciliation for any account that has been set up as a bank account in **Everest**.


Bank reconciliation should be performed in a timely manner each month. In order to maintain a control over the cash balance, someone independent of cash receipts and disbursements should preferably do it. The independent reconciliation provides an opportunity for an internal verification of bank receipts and payments transactions.
