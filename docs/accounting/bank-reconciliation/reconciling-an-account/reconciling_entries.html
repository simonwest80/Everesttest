<h1 id="reconciling-transactions">Reconciling Transactions</h1>

<p>To select the transactions for reconciliation, you must tag the checks/deposits  that have been cleared.</p>

<p class="steps">To tag a payment or deposit, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Bank Reconciliation</strong> browser, highlight  the required transaction and select <strong>Mark 
 Selection</strong> from the right-click menu.</li>
  <li>You will see  a check mark beside the selected transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you tag the payments/deposits that have been cleared, the summary  section displayed in the right side of the browser will be updated. You  are also provided with a calculator in the <strong>Bank 
 Reconciliation</strong> browser to enable computations.</p>

<p>If certain charges such as bank fees have not been accounted, select  <strong>Options &gt; Adjustment Entries</strong> to  account for the same.</p>
