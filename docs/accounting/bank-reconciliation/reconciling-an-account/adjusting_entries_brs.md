# Adjusting Entries


Use this option (path: **Bank Reconciliation**  browser > **Options** > **Adjustment Entries**) to account for transactions  contained in the bank statement, that are overlooked in your books.

The adjusting entries are created in a general journal with the description  'Bank Reconciliation Adjustments' only when the statement is fully reconciled  and you save the reconciliation details. If the statement has not been  fully reconciled, the adjusting entries are saved when you save the details  and exit the bank reconciliation browser.


The adjusting entries that are created are automatically posted.


When you select this option the **Adjustment
