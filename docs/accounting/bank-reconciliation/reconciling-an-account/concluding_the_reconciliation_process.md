# Concluding the Reconciliation Process


{:.steps}
To conclude the bank reconciliation process,  do the following:

- From the **Bank Reconciliation** browser, tag all  the payments/deposits that are present in the bank statement.
- Create adjustment  entries if required to account for any charges that have been overlooked.
- When the difference  has been eliminated, select **Options &gt; 
 Save Changes**. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to  save the details.
- Click **Yes**. You will then be informed that  your records have been reconciled.



At this stage you have three options:

- **Mark 
 Reconciled** - Click **Mark Reconciled** to mark all the entries that have been marked as cleared and the  bank account as reconciled. You will then be asked if you want to print  the reconciliation report. The **Reconciliation 
 Report** option in the **Options** menu  also enables you to print the reconciliation report. The details are saved  and the adjustment entry, if any, is automatically posted.



This will mark all the payment and deposit  transactions that are cleared/selected as reconciled. Transactions marked  as reconciled are displayed in the **Payment 
 Register** with the status **Reconciled**.

{:.hint}
Once the Bank account is reconciled by selecting  this option, the **Bank Reconciliation 
 Statement** cannot be printed. You must therefore ensure that this  statement is printed before marking the account as reconciled.

- **Save 
 &amp; Exit** - Click **Save &amp; 
 Exit** to save the reconciliation details and return to the **Everest** main screen. Use this option  when you want to continue reconciling the account at a later date. When  you return to the reconciliation, the statement balance and the entries  tagged will be automatically displayed.
- **Continue** - Click **Continue** if you  have not yet completed the reconciliation and want to return to the Bank  Reconciliation browser.
