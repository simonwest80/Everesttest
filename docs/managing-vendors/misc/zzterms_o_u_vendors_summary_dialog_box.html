<p>The average number of days over due date taken to pay a vendor is calculated  using the following formula:</p>

<p>Average number of days over due date = Sum of (Fully Paid Date - Due  Date) for all PAID invoices/number of PAID invoices</p>

<p>The fully paid date is the date on which the balance due on the purchase  invoice becomes Nil.</p>

<p class="note">A negative figure indicates that you have  been paying the vendor before the due date.</p>
