title: Posting Group
---


Select a Posting Group to associate the vendor with. For new vendors,  by default this field is populated with the Posting Group that is defined  for the log in location. The location is considered based on the sub-location  selected in the vendor profile. If no sub-location has been selected in  the vendor profile, then it will default to the Posting Group defined  for the logged-in-location. However, you can assign a different Posting  Group to the vendor in the **Vendor**  profile.


For existing vendors, this field is blank, indicating that the Posting  Group for the vendor class to which the vendor belongs would be considered.  To override the Posting Group of the vendor class, select a Posting Group  in this field.
