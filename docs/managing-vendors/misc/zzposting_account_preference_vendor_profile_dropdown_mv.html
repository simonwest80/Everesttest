<p>Specify an account selection methodology to be used for the  <strong>Vendor</strong> profile. You can specify  accounts without setting up posting groups. If you prefer to use posting  groups (groups of accounts), instead of making individual account selections,  that option is also available.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Accounts Based Upon Hierarchy</strong> – Select this option if you would  like the system to use vendor control accounts at the location level first  (if defined) and then at the company level (accounting defaults).</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Posting Groups</strong> – Select this option if you would like to use Posting  Groups to define your accounts. If you select this option, you must enter  a “Vendor Posting Group” in the <strong>Posting 
 Group</strong> field that appears when you make this selection.</li>
  <li><strong>Specify 
 Accounts</strong> – Select this option if you would like to specify the  vendor control accounts to use for this Vendor. Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-vendors/img/look_up_button_mv.gif" alt="" />  lookup  button to view the related accounts that can be defined (see the following  figure). On the <strong>Accounts</strong> screen,  select the <strong>Vendor Control</strong> <strong>Accounts</strong> that you would like to define  for this Vendor. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and  then click <strong>OK</strong> to apply your selections.</li>
