# Average Amounts


The average value of a purchase invoice, the average value of a debit  memo and the net purchases (purchases - returns) per document are displayed.


Average Purchases = Total Purchases/Total Number of Invoices


Average Purchase Returns = Total Purchase Returns/Total Number of Debit  Memos


Average Net Purchases = Net Purchases/Net Invoices Number

In this formula:

- Net Purchases =  Total Purchases - Total Purchase Returns
- Net Invoice Number  = Total Number of Purchase Invoices - Total Number of Debit Memos
