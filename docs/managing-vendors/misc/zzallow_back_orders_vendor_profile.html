<p>Check this box if partial shipments are allowed on purchase orders.  If the <strong>Allow Back Orders</strong> check  box is selected, the <strong>Allow Back Orders</strong>  check box on the <strong>Purchase Order</strong>  profile is selected by default. You can change this option at the document  level.</p>

<p>If you do not select this check box, the entire order has to be converted  to a receipt or invoice; there cannot be partial shipments. If you try  to make a partial shipment, the purchase receipt or invoice is NOT saved.  <strong>Everest</strong> prompts you that partial  shipment of items are not allowed.</p>

<p>This option is applicable only at the time of conversion of purchase  order into purchase receipt or invoice.</p>
