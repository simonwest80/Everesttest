The average number of days over due date taken to pay a vendor is calculated  using the following formula:


Average number of days over due date = Sum of (Fully Paid Date - Due  Date) for all PAID invoices/number of PAID invoices


The fully paid date is the date on which the balance due on the purchase  invoice becomes Nil.


{:.note}
A negative figure indicates that you have  been paying the vendor before the due date.
