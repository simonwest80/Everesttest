<p>Vendors include all entities from whom you buy or propose to buy products  or services. You need to set up vendors to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Place purchase  orders.</li>
  <li>Make vendor  deposits.</li>
  <li>Account for  invoices received from a vendor.</li>
  <li>Manage tasks  and appointments for the vendor or vendor prospect.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>**You have to 
 set up a vendor account for</strong>:**</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each vendor  account that has to be maintained.</li>
</ol>

<p class="example">If you purchase items from two branches of  the same company and you want to track the purchase details of each branch,  you have to set up an account for each branch.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each currency  in which you are billed by the same vendor.</li>
</ol>

<p class="example">If you buy from ABC Inc.  in France and UK, you must set up two accounts: one with currency as French  Francs and the other with currency as British Pound Sterling.</p>

<p>However, two accounts are not required when  your invoices from a vendor are in a single currency even though you make  payments in different currencies.</p>

<p class="example">ABC Inc.  always invoices you in French Francs but you make payments in either French  Francs or British Pound Sterling. In this case you do not require two  accounts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each vendor  prospect - To track tasks associated with a prospective vendor.
    <ul>
      <li>Every customer  that you also buy from. If you sell to and buy from the same entity, you  must set up separate customer and vendor accounts.</li>
      <li>Each employee,  if you are using the <strong>Everest</strong> <strong>US Payroll</strong>.</li>
      <li>Employees,  to whom you make travel advances or other advances.</li>
      <li>Routing all  salary payments through one consolidated vendor account for all employees.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
