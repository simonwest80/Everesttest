# Billing Address


The vendor's billing address is the address from where the vendor's  invoice is sent. The billing address is specified in the **Vendor** profile **- General** tab.


{:.note}
You can modify a vendor’s billing address by using the **Modify 
 Address** option (path: **Vendor**  profile > **Options**). This option  is enabled only for vendors whose billing address has been used while  creating final documents such as purchase invoices and debit memos.


When you modify a vendor’s billing address, **Everest**  allows you to do the following:

- Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the vendor.
- Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.


The original address is retained on the purchase documents on which  it was used. The new address is used on new documents created for the  vendor.


A vendor can have only one billing address but may have any number of  return and contact addresses.
