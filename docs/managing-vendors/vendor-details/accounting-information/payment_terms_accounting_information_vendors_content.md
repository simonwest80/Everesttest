# Payment Terms


The **Payment Terms** allowed by  the vendor is the basis for calculation of due date for payments on purchases  and cash discounts for prompt payments.


Select the **Calculate** **due 
 date based on purchase invoice date** check box **** to calculate the due date from the date of creation of the purchase  invoice. If you do not select this option, the due date is calculated  based on the date in the vendor's invoice.


The payment term specified in the **Vendors** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Vendors**) is set up as the default payment  term.
