# Item Purchase/Returns


Use this option (path: **Vendor** profile **** > **Options**  > **History &gt; Item Purchase/Returns 
 &gt; &lt;document name&gt;**) to view the purchase or purchase return  documents created for the selected vendor. Select this option to view  the **Item Purchase History** browser  for the selected document type. By default, this browser is grouped by  the items contained in the document.


The items' purchase/return history is useful to obtain the total quantities  of items ordered, purchased or returned to a vendor.


The **Item Purchase History** browser  displays all the items in the selected document type (purchase quotes,  orders, receipts, invoices, and debit quotes, orders, memos) and lists  all the documents in which the item is found. The details listed are the  document number, description, the item quantity, the price, document date,  amount of discount, tax code, asset and expense account.
