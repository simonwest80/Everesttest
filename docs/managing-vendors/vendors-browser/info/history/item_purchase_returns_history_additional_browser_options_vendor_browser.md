# Item Purchase/Returns


Use this option (path: **Vendors** browser  > **Options** > **History 
 &gt; Item Purchase/Returns &gt; &lt;document name&gt;**) to view  the purchase or purchase return documents created for the selected vendor.  Select this option to view the **Item Purchase 
 History** browser for the selected document type. By default, this  browser is grouped by the items contained in the document.


The items' purchase/return history is useful to obtain the total quantities  of items ordered, purchased or returned to a vendor.


The **Item Purchase History** browser  displays all the items in the selected document type (purchase quotes,  orders, invoices, debit quotes, orders, memos) and lists all the documents  in which the item is found. Details such as document number, item description,  quantity, and price, document date, amount of discount, and tax code are  listed.
