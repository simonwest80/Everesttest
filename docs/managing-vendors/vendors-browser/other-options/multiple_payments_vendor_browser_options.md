{:.note}
From the **Vendors** browser, you can select multiple vendors, to whom you want to make  payments. You do not need to specify **Payment 
 Journal Information** and **Document 
 Criteria** such as **Payment Terms** and **Document Aliases** in  the **Multiple Payments Wizard**.  These fields are automatically populated with the selected vendors information.
