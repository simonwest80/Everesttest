# Manual Sales Invoices


Manual sales invoices are created when you create an entry in a sales  journal debiting the customer. The document number is auto-generated and  prefixed with an "**M**"  to denote that it is a manual sales invoice.


The sequence number specified for manual sales invoices in the location  of the login location or sub-location is used. If the location's sequence  number is blank, the sequence number for the default location is used.


You can make modifications from within the manual sales invoice profile.

**Viewing Manual Sales Invoices**
: You can view manual sales invoices from the **Sales Invoices** browser by selecting  the **Accounting** option from the  **View** menu (path: **Sales 
 Invoices** browser > **View**  > **Accounting**). Manual Sales  Invoices have a **SI#** that is prefixed  with “M”.  Manual  documents also display “Accounting” in the **Type**  column.


**Modify Manual Sales Invoices**
: You can modify manual sales invoices from the **Sales Invoice** profile just as you would  with system documents. This is the preferred method for making manual  sales invoice modifications since only limited modifications are possible  from the sales journal.
