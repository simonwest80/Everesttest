<p>Manual sales invoices are created when you create an entry in a sales  journal debiting the customer. The document number is auto-generated and  prefixed with an “<strong>M</strong>”  to denote that it is a manual sales invoice.</p>

<p>The sequence number specified for manual sales invoices in the location  of the login location or sub-location is used. If the location’s sequence  number is blank, the sequence number for the default location is used.</p>

<p>You can make modifications from within the manual sales invoice profile.</p>
