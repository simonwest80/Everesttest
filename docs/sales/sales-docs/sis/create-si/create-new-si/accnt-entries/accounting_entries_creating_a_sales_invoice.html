<p>When a sales invoice is created, entries are made in the Sales Journal  to account for the revenue, sales discount, sales tax, and expense for  cost of goods sold.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> splits the revenue and  cost of goods sold into commissionable  and non-commissionable  based on whether the item is subject to sales commission. It also splits  revenues into taxable and non-taxable based on whether sales tax is payable.</p>

<p>The entry type in the sales journal distinguishes the commissionable,  taxable, non-commissionable  and non-taxable amounts.</p>
