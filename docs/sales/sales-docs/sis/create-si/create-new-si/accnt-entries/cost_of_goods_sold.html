<p>When an item is sold, the cost of goods sold or the expense account  is debited with the cost of the item sold. The cost of the item debited  depends on the type of item.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Serialized 
 items</strong> - The cost of goods sold account is debited with the actual  cost of each serial number.</li>
  <li><strong>Auto-serialized</strong> - The cost of goods sold account is debited with the actual cost  of each serial number.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-serialized 
 inventoried items</strong> - The cost of goods sold account is debited with  the average cost of the item at the time of creating the sales invoice.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-inventoried 
 items</strong> - The cost of goods sold account is debited with the average  cost of the item at the time of creating the sales invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Entries are made for factored or inflated costs for the difference between  the factored average and the actual average cost.</p>
