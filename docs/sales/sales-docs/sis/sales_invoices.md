# Sales Invoices


**A sales invoice (path: **Invoicing**  > **Sales** **Invoices**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window**) is the document  that accounts for the items or services shipped. Sales invoices in **Everest** thus serve a dual purpose:**

- **Recording 
 issue of items** - The sales invoice acts as a 'Goods Shipped Note'  as items are reduced from inventory only after the sales invoice is created.
- **Accounting 
 for Sales** - The sales invoice is the base document used to account  the value of sales.



**A sales invoice is required to do the following:**

- Apply deposits  made on an order or adjust a credit memo against amounts due from the  customer.
- Reduce item  quantities when items are shipped.
- Compute commission  due on sales.
