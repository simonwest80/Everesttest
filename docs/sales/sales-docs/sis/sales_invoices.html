<p><strong>A sales invoice (path: **Invoicing</strong>  &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Invoices</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>) is the document  that accounts for the items or services shipped. Sales invoices in <strong>Everest</strong> thus serve a dual purpose:**</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Recording 
 issue of items</strong> - The sales invoice acts as a ‘Goods Shipped Note’  as items are reduced from inventory only after the sales invoice is created.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounting 
 for Sales</strong> - The sales invoice is the base document used to account  the value of sales.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A sales invoice is required to do the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply deposits  made on an order or adjust a credit memo against amounts due from the  customer.</li>
  <li>Reduce item  quantities when items are shipped.</li>
  <li>Compute commission  due on sales.</li>
</ul>
