<p>Inventoried items are assigned to an ‘Out’  stock area on shipment.</p>

<p>The default stock area to which the items shipped on the sales invoice  are transferred is determined by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A default stock  area is specified in the <strong>Sales Invoice</strong>  field of the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog  box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab)  of the user creating the sales invoice.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock areas are defined in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong>, the items are transferred to the stock area defined for  sales invoices in the logged in location or sub-location (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location 
 &gt; Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong> &gt;  <strong>Locations</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> <strong>&gt; Stock Transfer 
 &gt; Sales Document</strong> tab).</li>
  <li>If no stock  area is defined for the logged in location or sub-location, the stock  area defined for the default location is used.</li>
</ul>
