# Shipping Items


**When an existing order is processed to  an invoice, the **Committed** column  for each item displays the quantity committed at the time of conversion.**


**The **Shipped**  column automatically displays the quantity committed on the order, if  any. If no quantity has been committed, the **Shipped**  column displays the quantity ordered and not shipped. If you select the  option **Set the quantity shipped value 
 to zero when converting the sales order to sales invoice (force you to 
 enter the quantity shipped)** in the flow control preferences (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Others &gt; Others 
 1** tab), this column defaults to zero.**


**If you create a sales invoice directly,  the **Shipped** column defaults to  zero. Enter the quantity being shipped in this column.**
