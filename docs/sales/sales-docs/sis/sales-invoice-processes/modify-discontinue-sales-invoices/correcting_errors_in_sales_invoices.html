<h1 id="correcting-errors-in-sales-invoices">Correcting Errors in Sales Invoices</h1>

<p>The errors that may occur in a sales invoice and the method to be followed  to correct these errors are detailed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wrong 
 customer information</strong> - If you create a sales invoice for the wrong  customer, you can create a Credit Memo to offset the amount payable or  create a manual credit memo by crediting the customer in the sales journal.  You can then create the sales invoice for the correct customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Item 
 selling price/value</strong> - If the item price of a non-inventoried item  has been wrongly entered, create a credit memo if the price is overstated  or a manual sales journal for the item if the value is understated. For  inventoried items, you cannot correct the error by bringing the item into  a credit memo or sales invoice as the stock quantity will be affected.  Instead, create a non-inventoried item for adjustments, and either bill  the customer for the shortage with a supplementary invoice or create a  credit memo with the adjustment item if excess was charged.</li>
  <li><strong>Item 
 quantity</strong> - If the item quantity actually shipped is less than what  is entered, create a Credit Memo for the difference in the quantity of  item shipped; if the item quantity shipped is more than what is entered,  create a new Sales Invoice for the item.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment 
 information</strong> - If the payment on the document has not yet been received,  and you have selected the wrong payment term, at the time of receiving  the payment you can enter the correct discount amount. In case the payment  has already been received, and excess discount was given to the customer,  create a manual sales journal to collect the excess discount from the  customer. In case the payment has already been received and the discount  given to the customer was less, create a credit memo for this difference.</li>
  <li><strong>Allocation 
 to the wrong cost center or location/sub-location</strong>- In case an expense  or income account has been allocated to the wrong cost center or location/sub-location,  create a general journal entry debiting and crediting the relevant account  and selecting the cost centers to and from which the amount has to be  re-allocated.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  you debit cost center A instead of cost center B for account # 1000, create  a General Journal, debiting account # 1000 and cost center B and crediting  account # 1000 and cost center A.</p>
