# Print Gift Receipt


Use the **Print Gift Receipt**  option to print the gift receipt(s).  Select  your destination printer from the drop-down list. You can print one gift  receipt for the entire document, a gift receipt for each line item or  separate gift receipts for each quantity of each line item. You can print  the gift receipts only after you save the invoice.


To change the type of gift receipt, select  the  **Change Gift Receipt Type** option  from the sales invoice (path: **Options 
 &gt; Change Gift Receipt Printing Type**). The **Gift**  column displays an icon that represents the type of gift receipt selectable  by you.  This  option functions as a toggle key and changes the gift receipt (icon) to  the alternate type. 

The following table displays the different types of gift receipts that  you can print from the Sales Invoice profile.
