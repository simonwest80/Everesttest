<p>Unprocessed recurring sales orders are displayed in the <strong>Recurring 
 Sales Orders</strong> browser. Tasks are also created for each sales order  that has to be converted to an invoice. The <strong>Contact 
 Manager</strong> profile also displays information on the sales orders that  have to be processed.</p>

<p>You may keep a sales order pending while processing a subsequent one.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You  can process a recurring sales order for May before processing the one  in the same series that pertains to April.</p>

<p>You can keep track of sales orders that have not been processed on the  due date by using the date filter “This Year-to-date” in the  <strong>Sales Orders</strong> browser.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Invoicing &gt; Sales 
 Orders</strong>. You will see the <strong>Sales 
 Orders</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Orders</strong> browser, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Recurring Documents</strong>.  All recurring sales orders that have not been processed into invoices  are displayed in this browser.</li>
