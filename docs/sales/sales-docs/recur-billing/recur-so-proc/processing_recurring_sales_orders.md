# Processing Recurring Sales Orders


Processing is the process of converting the sales orders to sales invoices.  Multiple recurring sales orders can be processed at the same time provided  these orders bear the login date or a date prior to the login date.


{:.note}
Sales orders bearing a date later than the login date  cannot be processed.


{:.steps}
To process recurring documents, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Sales 
 Orders**. You will see the **Sales 
 Orders** browser.
- From the **Sales Orders** browser, select **Options 
 &gt; Recurring Documents**.



{:.note}
Only recurring sales orders that have not been converted  to a sales invoice are displayed in the browser when this option is selected.

- Select the  document(s)  to be processed.
- From the **Sales Orders** browser, select **Options 
 &gt; Process Recurring Documents**.



{:.note}
The **Process Recurring 
 Documents** option is enabled only when the **Recurring 
 Documents** option is selected in the **Sales 
 Orders** browser.


**Everest** converts the selected  sales orders to invoices and saves the sales invoices automatically.
