<p>The <strong>Finance Charges</strong> feature (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong> &gt; <strong>Customers</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Finance Charges</strong> tab) allows you to apply finance charges on customer invoices that have not been paid even after the due date for payment. These charges appear on the customer statements and become a receivable from the customer.</p>

<p>Finance charges are automatically computed by the system. Charging finance charges is a two-step process:</p>
