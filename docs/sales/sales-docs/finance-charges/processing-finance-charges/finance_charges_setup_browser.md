# The Finance Charges Setup Browser


The **Finance Charges Setup** browser  is displayed when the parameters are specified in the **Finance 
 Charges** profile (path: **Accounting 
 &gt; Account Receivable &gt; Finance Charges**) and the **OK** button is clicked.


The browser contains two sections:

- [The  Finance Charges section]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/the_finance_charges_section.html) and
- [The  Customer Document section]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/the_customer_document_section.html)



Select the required documents/customers and select **Options 
 &gt; Save** from the **Finance Charges 
 Setup** browser to create a sales journal accounting for the finance  charges. These charges appear on the customer statements and are receivable  from the customer.
