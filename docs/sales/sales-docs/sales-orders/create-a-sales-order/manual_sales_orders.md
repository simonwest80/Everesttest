# Manual Sales Orders


Manual sales orders are created when you create an entry in a Receipts  Journal with the entry type 'Miscellaneous Deposit'.  The document number is auto-generated prefixed with '**M**' to  denote that it is a manual sales order. The sequence number for manual  sales orders specified in the login location or sub-location is used.  If the location's sequence number is blank, the sequence number for the  default location is used.


You can make modifications from within the manual sales order profile  and convert sales orders to sales invoices in the same manner as system  documents.

**Viewing Manual Sales Orders**


You can view manual sales orders from the **Sales 
 Orders** browser by selecting the **Accounting**  option from the **View** menu (path:  **Sales Order** browser > **View** > **Accounting**).  Manual Sales Orders have a **SO#**  that is prefixed with “M”.  Manual  documents also display “Accounting” in the **Type**  column.


**Modify Manual Sales Orders**


You can modify manual sales orders from the **Sales 
 Order** profile just as you would with system documents. This is  the preferred method for making manual sales order modifications since  only limited modifications are possible from the receipts journal.
