# Advantages - Creating a Sales Order


Although a sales invoice can be directly created when the items are  issued, creating a sales order has the following advantages:

- **Materials 
 planning** - This helps to track the items on order and backorder,  and the expected dates of delivery. This allows you to plan your inventory  and make decisions on placing new orders.
- **Issuing 
 items for approval** - You can issue items against a sales order  without your actual stock being reduced. Such stock is merely shown as  'stock on reserve'.  This helps you keep track of items issued to customers for inspection  and approval.
- **Deposits 
 from customers** - You can receive deposits from customers on sales  orders and thereby keep track of such orders.
- **Tracking 
 lead-time** - Creating a sales order and then issuing items against  it helps to track the lead-time between the sales order date and delivery  date.
- **Closing 
 opportunities** - When you convert a sales quote to an order, the  opportunity connected to the sales quote is automatically marked as closed  by the system.
