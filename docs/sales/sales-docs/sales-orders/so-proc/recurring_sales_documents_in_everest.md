# Recurring Sales Documents


Currently, you can create recurring documents in **Everest** for sales orders with non-inventoried items.


**<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="Verdana">The steps in creating 
 a recurring sales order are enumerated below:</font>**

- Create a sales  order for the required customer.



{:.note}
Only non-inventoried items can be added to recurring  sales orders. If a sales document also contains inventoried items, the  recurrence is applicable only to the non-inventoried items.

- Define the  recurrence schedule.

When the details are saved, **Everest** creates as many sales orders as are required by the recurrence  pattern defined.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you are creating a sales order for monthly maintenance for a year, **Everest** creates 12 sales orders. Tasks  (using the Contact Manager function) are also created automatically with  reminders to convert these sales orders into invoices on the scheduled  dates.


**Processing Recurring Sales Orders**


Sales orders are converted to sales invoices on the scheduled date by  selecting the relevant option. The 'contact manager'  function reminds you on the due date to convert the sales order to an  invoice.


{:.note}
Information contained in recurring sales orders such  as the item quantity, price and billing information can be modified at  any time.
