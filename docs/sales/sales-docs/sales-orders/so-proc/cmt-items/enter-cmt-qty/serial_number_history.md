# Serial Number History


When a serial number is attached to the sales order or sales invoice,  an entry is made in the **Serial Number 
 History** browser. It provides details of the stock areas and the  documents to which a serial number was assigned.


You can view this browser by selecting **Options 
 &gt; Serial Number History** from the **Sales 
 Order/Sales Invoice** profile or browser.
