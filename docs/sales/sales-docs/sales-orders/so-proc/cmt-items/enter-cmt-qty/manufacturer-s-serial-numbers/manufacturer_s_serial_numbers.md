# Manufacturer's Serial Numbers


The manufacturer's serial number is the number assigned by the manufacturer  to the product. You may want to assign manufacturer's serial numbers to  auto-serialized items to track the items that you ship. Most manufacturers  assign serial numbers that are prefixed with the part/item number and  suffixed with the model number.
