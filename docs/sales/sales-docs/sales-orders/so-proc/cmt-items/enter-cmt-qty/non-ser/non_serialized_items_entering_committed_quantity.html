<p>You can attach inventory contained in only ‘stock’ type of stock areas  to a sales order/invoice for positive quantities.</p>

<p class="steps">To enter the committed quantity for a non-serialized,  inventoried item, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Sales Order/Sales Invoice</strong> profile, click  on the required item in the item grid.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve Serial # &gt; 
 Show/Attach area wise stock</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/cmt-items/enter-cmt-qty/non-ser/the_attach_quantity_profile.html"><strong>Attach quantity for &lt;item name&gt;</strong> dialog  box</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Attach Quantity</strong>  dialog box can also be displayed by double-clicking in the <strong>Committed</strong>  column. The profile is displayed if the option ‘Use Default Stock area  to assign quantity for non-serialized items in sales documents’ is not  selected in <strong>Location</strong> profile.  All ‘Stock’ type of stock areas will be listed. For negative quantities,  this profile lists all ‘Out’ type of stock areas.</p>

<p>Adding to Items Committed</p>

<p>Additional items may be committed by entering the new quantity committed.  The additional quantity will be assigned to the stock area to which other  items have been committed.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  you now want to commit 20 items of an item out of which 10 were previously  committed, enter 20 in the <strong>Attached</strong>  column of the <strong>Attach Quantity</strong> dialog  box.</p>
