<h1 id="service-items">Service Items</h1>

<p>You can keep track of items that are received for service or repairs.  To do this, change the item type to ‘service’.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  you receive a music system for service, create a service order (alias  for sales order) and change the item type to service.</p>

<p class="steps">To track items received for service and bill  for services rendered, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Invoicing</strong> &gt;  <strong>Other</strong> <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Order</strong>  &gt; <strong>Service</strong> <strong>Order</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Service Orders</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Service Orders</strong> browser, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong>  &gt; <strong>In</strong> <strong>New</strong><strong>Window</strong>. You will see the <strong>Sales Order</strong> profile.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hint">If you have not created the document alias ‘Service  Order’, you  can create a sales order directly by selecting <strong>Invoicing</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales Orders</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Retrieve the  item code into the document.</li>
  <li>Change the  item type to service by clicking the <strong>Type</strong> column for the line item and pressing the <strong>Spacebar</strong> key.</li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/cmt-items-to-co/attach-cmt-qty/attaching_committed_quantities_on_credit_order.html">Attach/Commit  the items</a> returned for repair or service.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The serial number must be attached from the ‘Out’ type  of stock areas for items received from customers for service. These items  continue to be in the ownership of customers; hence, they are not added  back to your stock.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you have  completed the order, bill the customer by converting the order to an invoice.  You can charge the customer for the service either by entering a price  in the item’s price column or adding another line item for service charges.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also generate serial numbers for service items that need to  be tracked from the <strong>Sales Order</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve 
 Serial # &gt; Generate Serial #</strong>).</p>
