<h1 id="blind-shipment">Blind Shipment</h1>

<p>Blind ship is the process of shipping goods to your customer’s customer  without providing details of the person actually shipping the goods (i.e.,  you).</p>

<p>Details of the actual vendor are not printed on the packing slips (in  the blind ship format), sent with the goods.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> A  customer (A) who buys goods from you is also a retail vendor to customer  (B). If (A) does not have sufficient stocks to fulfill the sales orders  of (B), (A) can request you to deliver the goods as a blind shipment.  You will ship the goods to (B) with either the address or logo of (A)  printed on the packing slips. When (B) receives the goods, this packing  slip is acknowledged. You can raise a normal sales invoice on (A) and  attach the acknowledged copy of the packing slip as proof of delivery.</p>

<p>For a blind shipment, you have to create a normal sales invoice.</p>

<p>However, the ship to address in the sales invoice is the address of  the customer’s customer (B in the above example) and the billing address  is of the customer on whose behalf you are selling the goods (A in the  above example).</p>

<p>The packing slip (in blind ship format) should display the address and  the logo taken from the profile of the customer (path: <strong>Invoicing 
 &gt; Customers &gt; Options &gt; In New Window &gt; Addresses/Logo</strong>  tab) on whose behalf you are sending the goods (A in the above example).  To do this, select the customer on whose behalf you are sending the goods  in the <strong>Customer</strong> field of the sales  document.</p>

<p>For the packing slip to appear in the blind ship format, select the  <strong>Blind Ship Format</strong> check box in  the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/print/document_printing_preferences_dialog_box.html"><strong>Document Printing Preferences</strong> dialog  box</a> (path: Sales Document profile &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Print &gt; Order/Invoice</strong>).</p>
