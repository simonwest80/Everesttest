<p class="steps">To select items for drop shipment, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Generate PO - Drop Ship Items</strong> browser,  select the items for which the drop ship purchase order must be created.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">By default, all the items in the sales order document  that are marked for drop shipment and for which no purchase order is created  are selected in this browser. To create a purchase order for items not  marked for drop shipment, select the check box next to the item.</p>

<p>You can change the following in the <strong>Generate 
 PO - Drop Ship Items</strong> browser:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vendor</li>
  <li>Quantity Ordered</li>
  <li>Price</li>
</ul>

<p>Change the Vendor</p>

<p>You can change the vendor by selecting <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit Line Items</strong> in the <strong>Generate 
 PO - Drop Ship Items</strong> browser, and selecting any other vendor in  the <em>**</em> <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/misc/the_profile_line_item_s_profile_drop_ship.html"><strong>Profile - Line Item(s)</strong> window</a>.</p>

<p>The items selected for the drop ship order are grouped according to  the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/managing-items/item-profile-details/other-items-information/purchase/default_vendor.html">default vendor</a>  assigned to the item in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p>If the item has not been assigned a default vendor you are prompted  of the same.</p>

<p>If more than one item has been selected and one of the items has not  been assigned a default vendor you are prompted that the vendor is not  defined for the particular item<strong>. I</strong>n  such an instance, a drop- ship order is not created for the item.</p>

<p>Modify the Quantity Ordered</p>

<p>You can change the quantity of the items ordered on drop shipment. Click  in the <strong>Qty Needed</strong> column in the  <strong>Generate PO - Drop Ship Items</strong> browser  and enter the quantity. Quantity ordered on drop shipment cannot be more  than the quantity on the sales order. If it is, <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you with a message.</p>

<p>Modify the Cost</p>

<p>You can modify the cost of the items ordered on drop shipment. Click  in the <strong>Cost</strong> column in the <strong>Generate PO - Drop Ship Items</strong> browser  and enter the revised cost.</p>
