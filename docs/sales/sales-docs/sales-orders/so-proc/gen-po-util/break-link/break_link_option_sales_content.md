# Break Link 


Once the drop ship purchase order or a linked purchase order is created,  the **Break Link** option is enabled.  The **Break Link** option (path: **Sales** **Order**  profile > **Options** > **Generate Purchase Orders** > **Break Link**) allows you to break the  link for the line item between the sales process and the purchase process  during the drop ship process or while creating linked purchase orders.
