# Mark Open


**Use the **Mark 
 Open** option to re-open a closed order.**


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You mark an order as complete  when the customer no longer needs shipment of an item. At a later stage,  if the customer wants the item, you can mark the order as open.


The status of a closed sales order may  be changed to open by increasing the quantity ordered or adding new items  on the order, though it is not mandatory.


If you try to save a closed sales order  after adding a new item or increasing the ordered quantity, **Everest**  asks you whether you want to increase the quantity or add new item. If  you click **YES**, the order is saved  and the status changes to "Backorder" if there are partially  shipped quantities or to "Open" if the quantity shipped is zero.  If you click **NO**, the status remains  open and changes are not saved.


If you try to re-open a closed order without  adding new line items or increasing the ordered quantity, you will not  get any message.


{:.note}
If you save an order after modification/addition of  inline notes or extended notes, the order status remains closed. You need  to select the **Mark Open** option  to re-open the order.


{:.steps}
To mark an order open, you must do the following:

- Open the closed  sales order.



{:.hint}
To view closed orders, select **Options 
 &gt; Shipped Sales Orders** from the **Sales 
 Orders** browser.

- Add the item  to be ordered if the item does not exist on the order.
- If the item  to be ordered exists on the sales order, increase the quantity ordered.



**When items are added to the sales order  and the document is saved, the status of the order changes to 'Open'.**


**Back End Processes - Mark a Sales Order Open**


**When an order is marked open, its status  changes to **Open**. The order is  displayed in the **Sales Orders**  browser.**
