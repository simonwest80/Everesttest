<h1 id="detached-quantities---stock-areas-assigned">Detached Quantities - Stock Areas Assigned</h1>

<p>Detached quantities are moved to the default stock area that is specified  in the <strong>Workstation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>  or the stock transfer settings specified for the logged in location.</p>

<p>Items detached from a sales order are assigned to <strong>Stock</strong>  type of stock areas. This is because such stock continues to remain in  your ownership.</p>

<p>The stock area to which detached quantities are assigned is determined  based on the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a default  stock area for unassigned items on a sales order is specified in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> of the user detaching  the quantities (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab), the quantities are assigned to this stock area.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If no default  stock areas are defined in <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong>, the items are assigned to the stock area defined for  unassigned items on sales orders in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile of the logged in location/sub-location (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/ <strong>Sub-Location</strong>  &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Stock</strong> <strong>Transfer</strong>  &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Document</strong>  tab).</li>
