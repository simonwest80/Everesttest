<p>Credit card payments from customers can be processed from <strong>Everest</strong>  or processed outside <strong>Everest</strong>.  If you do not want to use <strong>Everest</strong>  to process certain credit card payments, set up your credit card payment  methods so that the <strong>Use Payment Processor</strong>  check box is not selected in the <strong>Credit 
 Card Processing</strong> tab (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Method</strong> profile <strong>&gt; Options</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong> &gt;  <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Credit 
 Card Processing</strong> tab).</p>

<p>Credit card payments that you accept from customers may be processed  using any of the following payment services that <strong>Everest</strong>  supports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ICVerify</li>
  <li>Payflow  Pro</li>
  <li>WorldPay</li>
</ul>

<p>A credit card payment is automatically processed when you select the  <strong>Use</strong> <strong>Payment 
 Processor</strong> check box in the <strong>Credit 
 Card Processing</strong> tab.</p>

<p>Payment currencies supported</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> currently supports all  currencies supported by the processor. You can specify the currencies  supported by the processor in the <strong>Processors</strong>  profile.</p>
