# Back End Processes - Prior Authorization


The following back-end processes occur when prior authorization for  a credit card payment is obtained:

- When a response  is received from the processing network, the authorization details no  longer appear in the **Online Credit Card 
 Processing** browser.
- The backend  processes for approved payments are the same as the processes when payment  is made through cash, check or any other method.
