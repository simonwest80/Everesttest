<p>The following back-end processes occur for credit card payments that  are received using the <strong>Pre-Authorize</strong> option:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When an authorization  is obtained, its details are stored.</li>
  <li>The funds may  be captured for this authorization after delivery of items or services  by processing the authorization using the <strong>Batch Payment 
 Processing</strong> option (path: <strong>Accounting 
 &gt; Account Receivable &gt; Batch Payment Processing</strong>). If you  select the <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Processing</strong>  check box in the <strong>Receipt</strong> dialog  box, you may capture funds later in batches.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana"> </font></li>
