# Refunds to Customers


You may need to refund the deposit paid on a sales order/sales invoice  if the order is not fulfilled or towards rebates or discounts.


{:.steps}
To refund a payment to a customer, do the  following:

- From the **Sales Order/Invoice** profile, select  **Options &gt; Payment &gt; Refund**.  You will see the [**Refund**  dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/refunds-on-so/the_refund_dialog_box.html).



The **Refund** dialog box is similar  to the **Payment** dialog box.
