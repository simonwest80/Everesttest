<p>When a refund is made against a sales invoice,  the back end processes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The customer’s  unposted amount  as seen in the <strong>Customer</strong> profile  increases by the amount of refund. The amount receivable from the customer  increases. When the payment journal for the payment is posted, the unposted  amount reduces and the posted amount increases with the amount receivable  to the customer staying the same.</li>
  <li>The amount  paid on the sales invoice decreases and the balance of the sales invoice  increases by the refund amount. If the amount on the sales invoice was  paid in full, its status changes to ‘Open’ after a refund is made.</li>
</ul>
