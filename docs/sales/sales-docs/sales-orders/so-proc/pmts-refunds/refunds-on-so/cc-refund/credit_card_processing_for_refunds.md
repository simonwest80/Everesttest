# Credit Card Processing for Refunds


Refunds may have to be made against a credit card payment that is authorized  and captured. A credit card payment is automatically processed when the  payment method for the credit card has the **Use****Payment Processor** check box selected  in the **Credit Card Processing**  tab (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt;****Credit Card Processing** tab).


When a refund is made, the charge to the credit card is reversed and  amounts are transferred from your merchant account back to the credit  card holder's issuing bank.

- From the **Sales Order/Invoice** profile, select  **Options &gt; Payment &gt; Refund**.  You will see the [**Refund**  dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/refunds-on-so/the_refund_dialog_box.html).
