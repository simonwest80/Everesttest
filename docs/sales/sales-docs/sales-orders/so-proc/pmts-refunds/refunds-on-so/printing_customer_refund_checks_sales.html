<p>When you make a refund on a sales order/invoice or a payment on a credit  order/memo, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts you  to confirm whether you want to print the check.</p>

<p class="note">This prompt is displayed only if the payment method  used is of type “Check” used for payments, and the check number  is NOT entered in the <strong>Payment</strong>  dialog box.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Yes</strong> to display the <strong>Check Printing</strong> dialog box.</p>

<p>The <strong>Print Checks</strong> option in the  <strong>Receipts Journal</strong> enables you to  print customer refund checks. If an error occurs during printing, clear  the ‘Check Printed’ column in the <strong>Printed 
 Checks</strong> browser that is displayed after the printing process.</p>
