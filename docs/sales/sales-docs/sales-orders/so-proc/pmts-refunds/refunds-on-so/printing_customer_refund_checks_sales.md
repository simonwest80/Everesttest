# Printing Customer Refund Checks


When you make a refund on a sales order/invoice or a payment on a credit  order/memo, **Everest** prompts you  to confirm whether you want to print the check.


{:.note}
This prompt is displayed only if the payment method  used is of type "Check" used for payments, and the check number  is NOT entered in the **Payment**  dialog box.


Select **Yes** to display the **Check Printing** dialog box.


The **Print Checks** option in the  **Receipts Journal** enables you to  print customer refund checks. If an error occurs during printing, clear  the 'Check Printed' column in the **Printed 
 Checks** browser that is displayed after the printing process.
