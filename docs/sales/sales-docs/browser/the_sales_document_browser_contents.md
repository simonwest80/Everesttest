# The Sales Document Browser


Sales Document browsers list all the documents of the selected sales  document type.


{:.steps}
To view the sales quote/order/invoice browser,  do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Invoicing** > **Sales Quote**/**Order**/**Invoice**. You will see the relevant document  browser.



{:.steps}
To view documents with a specific alias,  do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Invoicing** > **Other** **Documents**.  You will see a submenu that lists the sales documents.
- From the submenu,  select the required document type. You will see another submenu that lists  the aliases for the document.
- Select the  alias to view its document browser.



{:.note}
The **Other Documents** option displays sales quotes, sales orders and sales invoices along  with their system-generated document aliases. Selecting any of these options  brings up a browser of sales quotes, orders or invoices that does not  have a user-defined document alias.

 Documents** option.
