# Retrieve a Sales Quote


Once a sales quote has been converted to a sales order, the sales quote  can no longer be viewed in the **Sales 
 Quotes** browser.


To retrieve a sales quote, the sales order must be canceled. The sales  order then reverts to the sales quote and can once again be viewed from  the **Sales Quotes** browser.
