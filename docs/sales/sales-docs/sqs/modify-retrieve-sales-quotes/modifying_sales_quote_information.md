# Modify a Sales Quote 


You can modify all the information on a quote that has been saved, until  it is converted to an order.


**The **Sales 
 Quote** profile can be modified from any one of the following locations:**

- The **Sales 
 Quotes** browser - Highlight the record and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In Current Window/In New Window**.
- The **Sales 
 Quote** profile - Specify the document number of the required quote  in the **Document #** field.



**After the sales quote is converted to a  sales order, it ceases to exist as a sales quote in the system and cannot  be retrieved or printed.**
