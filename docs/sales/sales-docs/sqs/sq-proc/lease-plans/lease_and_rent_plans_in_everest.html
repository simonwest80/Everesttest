<p>A lease is a contract, granting use of item(s)  for a specified period in exchange for a specified sum of money. In <strong>Everest</strong>, the lease plan merely enables  you to view the amount of installments that the customer should pay. Receipts  or invoices for the amounts due are not automatically generated.</p>

<p>Having defined lease plans, you can create lease quotes or rental quotes  (path: Sales Document profile &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Lease</strong>).</p>

<p>Creating lease quotes enable you to inform your customer about the lease  installments that must be paid.</p>
