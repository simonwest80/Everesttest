# Lease and Rental Plans - Comparison


Lease and rental plans are compared in this section.

- **Everest** does not distinguish between lease and rental plans. Both are created  from the same **Lease Plan** profile.
- Rental plans  are used when you want to rent out your product to a customer but do not  want to transfer the ownership. Lease plans are used when you want to  lease out the product to the customer and also transfer the ownership.
- The main difference  between the lease plan and rental plan is that in case of a lease, the  leasing company would buy your product and lease it to the customer. In  case of rent, you rent the product to the customer.
