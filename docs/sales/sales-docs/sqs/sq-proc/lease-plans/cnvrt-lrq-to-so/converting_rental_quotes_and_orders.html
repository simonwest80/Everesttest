<p>When a sales quote with a rental plan attached is converted to an order  and then to an invoice, the details of the plan attached are copied to  the sales order or invoice.</p>

<p class="steps">The following steps are involved in renting  an item:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create the  rental quote.</li>
  <li>Convert the  rental quote to a sales order.</li>
  <li>Select a stock  area that represents ‘Items Out on Rent’ in the <strong>Assign 
 inventory from &gt; Sales Order</strong> field of your <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box <strong>** (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab).</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You  have to create a stock area that represents ‘Items out on Rent’  in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/options/miscellaneous-set-up/stock-areas/stock-areas/stock_area_profile_general_tab.html"><strong>Stock Areas</strong> profile</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attach the  items rented to the order.  The  rented items will be transferred to the selected stock area.</li>
  <li>For collecting  the amount of rent, create a new sales invoice.</li>
  <li>If the ownership  of the items is transferred to the customer at the end of the rental period,  convert the sales order created in the second step to an invoice.</li>
  <li>If the items  are returned to you and the rental agreement is terminated, detach the  items from the sales order created in the second step and close the order.</li>
</ul>
