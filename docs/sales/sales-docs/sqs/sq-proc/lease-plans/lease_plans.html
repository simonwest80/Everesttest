<p>A lease plan is a scheme offered by a leasing and finance company where  the buyer instead of purchasing a product, decides to take it on lease  by making periodic payments to the lessor. At the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to convert the lease into a sale or terminate  it.</p>

<p>The entities in a lease plan are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The 
 Lessee</strong> - The lessee is the customer who is taking a product on  lease. The customer instead of purchasing a product, leases it for a specified  period by paying periodic rentals. At the end of the lease period, depending  on the lease plan, the lessee may become the owner of the product.</li>
  <li><strong>The 
 Lessor</strong> - The lessor is the leasing company that finances the lease.  The lessor buys the product from the merchant and leases it to the lessee.</li>
  <li><strong>The 
 Merchant</strong> - The merchant sells the product to the leasing company  but ships it to the lessee.</li>
</ul>
