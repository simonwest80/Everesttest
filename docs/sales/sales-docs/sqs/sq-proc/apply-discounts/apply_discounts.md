# Apply Discounts


Discounts are calculated based on the discount schemes set up for items  in **Everest**.


The **Apply Discounts** option must  be used in the following situations:

- When the option  **Automatically apply item discounts applicable 
 to a customer when retrieving the item on a document** is not selected  in the **Documents** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document payments** tab).
- When modifications  made to the discounts are calculated and applied. Selecting the **Apply Discounts** option re-calculates  discounts available to the customer on all the items and overwrites the  modifications made.



{:.steps}
To apply the discounts, do the following:

- From the **Sales Quote/Sales Order/Sales Invoice**  profile, select **Options &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Apply Discounts**.



The discounts defined are applied. They can be viewed in the **Discount 
 Value** and **Discount %** columns  of the Item Details Grid.
