<p>The costs of only commissionable  items (inventoried and non-inventoried) are listed in the <strong>Pricing 
 Analysis</strong> browser when the user is not in extended mode. If the  user has logged into extended mode (path: <strong>Workstation 
 Settings &gt; Company Settings</strong> tab <strong>&gt;</strong>  check the <strong>Enable Extended Mode</strong>  option), then costs of all items are listed in the <strong>Pricing 
 Analysis</strong> browser, except for costs of kit type of items and non-inventoried  items without an expense and liability account. The last cost, average  cost, and actual cost of such an item are displayed as zero in the Pricing  Analysis browser. Costs of non-inventoried commissionable  items are listed only if the item has an expense and liability account  defined in <strong>Posting 
 Group</strong> profile.</p>

<p class="note">If you are in extended mode, the <strong>Pricing 
 Analysis</strong> browser displays the real cost and not the factored cost  of the items. The Factored cost is displayed only when you are NOT in  extended mode.</p>
