# Convert an Existing Sales Quote to a Sales Order


**You can convert a sales quote to an order  by selecting **Options &gt; Process &gt; 
 Reserve** in the sales quote. All the details of the quote are displayed  in the new **Sales Order** profile.  The **Ordered** column displays the  quantity quoted by default. You may make any changes required to the order  quantity and to any other information (including customer information)  in the order and save the order.**


**You can no longer access the sales quote  from the **Sales Quotes** browser.  However, it appears as a reference number in the **Document 
 Status** section of the **Sales Order** profile.**
