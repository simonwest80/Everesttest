# Pick Tickets


Pick tickets are required to inform the inventory and stores personnel  about orders that have to be picked and packed on any day.


The **Pick Ticket** function ensures  timely and accurate delivery of products to customers by integrating warehouse  and distribution functions with sales order processing.


The **Pull Sheet** **Wizard**  in **Everest** simplifies the picking  process. This wizard allows you to take the following decisions:

- How you want  the pick tickets to be generated.
- Whether priority  is required for back orders and sales orders.
- The stock bins  from which items can be pulled.
- The order of  picking.
- The method  for allocating quantities of non-serialized items tracked for lots.



The wizard also provides you with an advanced filter for determining  the sales orders for which you want to create pick tickets.


If you indicate that certain items are critical to the shipment, the  **Pull Sheet** **Wizard**  considers these as well.
