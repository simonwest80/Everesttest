# Record Colors in the Pick Ticket Browser


The records in the **Pick Ticket** browser  are sometimes colored blue, green and brick red. **Everest**  automatically displays these colors to indicate different statuses. These  are detailed below:


| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_blue_color_record_pk_tkt.gif) | This color indicates that back orders are not allowed for the selected  customer. For example, you CANNOT partly ship the items to the customer.<br/><br/><br/>![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) [Allow Back Order  Creation]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/docs-profile/contents/tab-details/details/other/allow_back_order_creation.html)<br/><br/><br/>By default, such sales orders are not selected in the **Pick <br/> Ticket Browser**.<br/><br/><br/>You can however, enter the picked quantity in the **Quantity <br/> to be Picked** column and commit them from the **Pull <br/> Sheet** browser. |
| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_dark_green_pk_tkt_brwsr.gif) | Indicates that the items marked for creating drop-ship purchase orders  are unchecked in the browser.<br/><br/><br/>![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) You can identify that these items have been marked for  generating drop-ship purchase order since the check box in the **Dropship**  column (line items grid) in the respective sales order is selected. |
| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_dark_blue_pk_tkt_brwsr.gif) | Indicates that the items marked for creating purchase order with links  are unchecked in the browser.<br/><br/><br/>![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) You can identify that these items have been marked for  generating purchase order with links since the **PO <br/> #** column (line items grid) in the respective sales order displays  the purchase order number for the line item. |
| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_back_order_color_pk_tkt.gif) | This color indicates that the items cannot be fully picked. For example,  some items may be on back order. |
| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_green_color_record_pk_tkt.gif) | This color indicates that critical and dependent items on the sales  order cannot be partially shipped.<br/><br/><br/>![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) [Critical  Items]({{site.mi_chm}}/item-profile-details/other-items-information/sales/critical_items_item_profile_contents.html)<br/><br/><br/>You can, however, enter the picked quantity for both critical and non-critical  items in the **Quantity to be Picked** column  and commit them from the **Pull Sheet** window. |
| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/pick_ticket_browser_bright_green_manually_commit_sal.gif) | This color indicates manually committed line items. These items are  selected or deselected depending upon the selected option in the **Line Items** section of the Pull Sheet  Wizard. |
