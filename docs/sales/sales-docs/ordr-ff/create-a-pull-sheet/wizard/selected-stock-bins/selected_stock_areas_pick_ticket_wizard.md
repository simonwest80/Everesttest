# Pull Sheet Wizard - Selected Stock Bins


This section allows you to define the order in which the stock should  be picked from the stock bins.


The pull sheet is created listing the stock bins in the sequence defined  here. Defining the sequence helps the picker move logically from one area  to another without wasting time in moving across warehouses when picking  items.


{:.steps}
To change the sequence in which items should  be picked, do the following:

- Highlight the  required stock bin.
- Click the **Up** arrow ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_up_arrow_icon.gif) and **Down** arrow ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_down_arrow2.gif) to change the priority of the stock bins.



The stock bin details, namely, location, parent stock area and bin position  are automatically updated from the **Stock 
 Bins** profile (path: **Inventory** > **Stock Areas &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**).


| ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) | [Stock  Bins Profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/miscellaneous-set-up/stock-areas/stock-bins/the_stock_bin_profile.html) |



Click **Next**. You will see the  **Quantity 
 Allocation** section of the **Pull 
 Sheet Wizard**.
