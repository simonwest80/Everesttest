<p>Use this section to determine whether manually committed line items  should be included on the Pull Sheet. Regardless of your selection, the  <strong>Pick Ticket</strong> browser which is used  to display a preview of the pull sheet will always display the manually  committed line items. This option allows you to control whether the committed  items will appear on the pull sheet and pick ticket reports.</p>

<p><strong>Manually Committed Line Items</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the <strong>Exclude from pull sheet and invoice</strong>  option if committed line items should NOT appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items will NOT be selected on the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> preview, and therefore, will not appear on the pull sheet.   Manually  committed items will still be invoiced if they are part of a sales order  that is converted using the Pull Sheet.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Include in the pull sheet</strong> option if  committed items should appear on the Pull sheet. The manually committed  line items will be selected (checked) on the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> preview, and therefore, will appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items are indicated in bright green on the <strong>Pull Sheet</strong> browser for easy reference.  This lets you know that inventory is already committed to the item. This  option is selected by default when a new filter is created.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If a line item has inventory committed from  multiple stock bins, each bin will be shown on separate lines in the Pull  Sheet and Pick Ticket report.</p>
