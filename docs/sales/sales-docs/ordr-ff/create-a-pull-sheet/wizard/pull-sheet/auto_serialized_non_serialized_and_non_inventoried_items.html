<h1 id="auto-serialized-and-non-serialized-items">Auto-serialized and Non-Serialized Items</h1>

<p>The quantity picked for auto-serialized and non-serialized items is  entered directly in the <strong>Quantity Picked</strong> column.</p>

<p>You can also scan the serial numbers for auto-serialized items into  the system using your bar code scanner or scan using the <strong>Commit 
 Inventory</strong> option.</p>

<p>Non-inventoried items cannot be picked since <strong>Everest</strong>  does not maintain stock of such items.</p>

<p>Only the bins that have been selected on <strong>Stock 
 Bin Selection</strong> page will appear. You have to pick the quantity that  is equal to or less than the available quantity in stock bin. You cannot  change the bin once some quantity has already been committed.</p>
