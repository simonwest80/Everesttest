# Serialized Items


Serial numbers of the item to be picked may be retrieved in any of the  following ways:

- [One  by one]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/one_by_one_entering_serialized_items_pull_sheet_browser.html)
- [In  a range]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/range_entering_serialized_items_pull_sheet_browser.html)



The serial numbers can also be scanned into the system using your bar  code scanner or scan / enter the serial number using the **Commit 
 Inventory** option. You have to select the serial # from the bin  that has been selected on **Stock Bin Selection**  page of the wizard.
