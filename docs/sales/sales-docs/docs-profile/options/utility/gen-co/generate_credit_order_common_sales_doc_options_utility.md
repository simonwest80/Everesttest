# Generate Credit Order


If a customer wishes to return an item, you can create a credit order  directly from a saved **Sales Invoice**  profile by using the **Generate Credit 
 Order** option (path: **Options &gt; 
 Utility &gt; Generate Credit Order**). Â All  the details present in the **Sales Invoice**  profile are automatically copied into the **Credit 
 Order** profile saving the time of re-entering data.

You can access the **Generate 
 Credit Order** option only from a **Sales 
 Invoice** profile.


{:.steps}
To generate a credit order directly from  a Sales Invoice profile, do the following:

- From the **Sales Invoice** profile, select **Options &gt; Utility &gt; Generate Credit Order**.  You will see the **** [**Generation of Credit Order** **from 
 Sales Invoice** browser]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/gen-co/generation_of_credit_order_browser_sales.html) listing the items in the sales invoice  document for which no credit order has been created, for the sales transaction.
- From the **Generation of Credit Order** browser,  choose the line items for which you want to create a credit order by selecting  the check box beside the item, and select **Options 
 &gt; Create CO**.



{:.note}
By default all the items are selected.


You will be informed that a credit order has been created. You will  also be asked whether you want to open the credit order document. Click  **Yes** to view the **Credit 
 Order** profile. Click **No**  to return to the **Generation of Credit 
 Order from Sales Invoice** browser.


By default, a credit quote is created automatically when you create  a credit order from a sales invoice document. You can view the credit  quote details from the document status section of the credit order document.
