# Compute Freight using Everest Freight Estimator


{:.steps}
To include freight on a sales or sales return  document, do the following:

- From the document  profile select **Options &gt; Utility &gt; 
 Everest Freight Estimator**. You will see [**Everest Freight Estimator** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/freight-est/everest-freight-estimator/the_everest_freight_estimator_dialog_box.html).



{:.note}
Freight is computed and automatically displayed in this  dialog box if a destination zone is defined for origin and destination  zip codes/addresses, and a freight rate is set up for the combination  of destination zone and delivery method (as selected on the document profile).

- Click **Update Document** to apply the freight  to the document.



{:.note}
The freight is added as a new line item to  the document. The item code specified in the **Default 
 item used for shipping charges** option (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Items**) is used to  account for the shipping charges.
