<h1 id="freight-estimation">Freight Estimation</h1>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> allows you to compute  freight using the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/freight-est/everest-freight-estimator/everest_freight_estimator.html"><strong>Everest</strong>  Freight Estimator.</a> <em>**</em></p>

<p>Freight is computed on an item only if you select the <strong>Include 
 in freight calculation</strong> option in the <strong>Item</strong>  profile (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt;  <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window &gt; Sales</strong> tab).</p>

<p class="note">You may include freight in a sales invoice even after  saving it. However, you cannot modify a sales invoice whose journal has  been posted.</p>

<p>You can use an external utility to compute shipping charges on your  sales documents. When you open one such document and if you select the  <strong>Prompt</strong> option as a preference  in the <strong>Prompt method for adding shipping 
 charges calculated by an external program</strong> field (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts 
 &gt; Sales Documents &gt; Sales Documents 2</strong> tab), <strong>Everest</strong>  prompts you to confirm if the freight amount must be updated. If you select  <strong>Automatic</strong> in the <strong>Prompt 
 method</strong> <strong>** **for adding 
 shipping charges calculated by an external program</strong> field, freight  amount is automatically updated on the document when the sales order/invoice <strong>** is **</strong> opened<strong>.</strong></p>
