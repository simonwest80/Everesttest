# Third Party Catalog - Default Catalog


Using the **Default Catalog** option,  you can view items that belong to the default third party catalog. This  option is useful when:

- You want to  compare prices of items that exist in your database with items in the  default third party catalog.
- You do not  have stock of an item, but you want to verify if the item is available  in a third party catalog.



A third party catalog can be set as a default by choosing a record from  the [**Third 
 Party Catalogs** browser]({{site.mi_chm}}/third-party-speciality-catalogs/third_parties_browser.html) and selecting **Options 
 &gt; Set as Default Catalog**.


{:.steps}
To view the default third party catalog,  do the following:

- From the **Sales Document** profile, select **Options &gt; Third Party Catalog &gt; Default 
 Catalog**. You will see the **Items**  browser listing all the items contained in the third party catalog.



{:.note}
If you have not set a default third party catalog, you  will see the [**Third 
 Party Catalogs** browser]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/third_party_catalogs_browser_sales.html).

- If you want  to add an item to the sales document, select the item and click **OK**.
