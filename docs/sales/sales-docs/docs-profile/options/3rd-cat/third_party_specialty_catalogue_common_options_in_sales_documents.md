Third-party databases such as vendor catalogs can be imported and browsed  for quick reference.

The sales department could also browse the catalog to see if an item  can be specially ordered for a customer. If a competitor's catalog is  imported, the sales department can check for the competitor's selling  prices and make a better offer to the customer.


The **Third-Party Catalog** option  (path: Sales Document profile > **Options 
 &gt; Third-Party Catalog**) allows you to sell items present on a  third-party catalog or import the item into stock and sell it to the customer.  Third-party catalog information that can be accessed from within a document  is listed below:
