<p>Drop shipments refer to the direct shipment of items from your vendors  to your customers. This method is useful for firms that do not stock inventories  of the products they sell. A purchase order is placed with vendors for  the products ordered by customers; the vendor directly supplies the items  to the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> provides you with a  utility to create drop ship orders from sales orders (path: <strong>Sales 
 Order</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options &gt; 
 Generate Purchase Orders &gt; Generate Drop Ship PO</strong>).</p>
