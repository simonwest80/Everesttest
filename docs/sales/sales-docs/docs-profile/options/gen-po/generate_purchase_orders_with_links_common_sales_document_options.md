# Generate Purchase Orders with Links


You may run out of stock while selling goods to your customer. In such  a case you can directly create purchase orders from a sales order. A purchase  order is placed with vendors for the items ordered by customers; the vendor  directly supplies the items to your customer. The purchase order is linked  to the corresponding sales order.


**Everest** provides you with a  utility to create purchase orders with links. This option is available  only on sales orders (path: **Sales Order** profile > **Options &gt; Generate 
 Purchase Orders &gt; Generate PO with Links**).
