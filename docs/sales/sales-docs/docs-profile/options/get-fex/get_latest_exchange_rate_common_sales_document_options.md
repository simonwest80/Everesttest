# Get Latest Exchange Rate


The **Get Latest Exchange Rate** option  (path: Sales Document profile > **Options 
 &gt; Get Latest Exchange Rate**) allows you to retrieve the latest  exchange rate on a sales document, as on the [login  date]({{site.wwe_chm}}/misc/login_date_management_synopsis.html). You can edit the exchange rate. The Exchange Rate option is  enabled only for foreign currency customers.


The exchange rate is retrieved from the **Buy 
 Rate/Sell Rate** fields in the [**Exchange Rates** profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/multicurrency/exchange-rates/set-up-exchange-rates/exchange_rates_profile.html) (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency 
 &gt; Exchange Rates &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**).


{:.note}
The rate displayed in the **Exchange 
 Rate** field (whether buy rate or sell rate), in turn, depends on  the option selected in the **Rate for sales 
 documents** field in the [**Accounting** dialog box]({{site.acc_chm}}/misc/exchange_rate_defaults_multicurrency.html) (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency &gt; Exchange Rates** tab).
