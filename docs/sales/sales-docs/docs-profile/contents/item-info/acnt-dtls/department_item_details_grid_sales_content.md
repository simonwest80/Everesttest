 or sub-location to allocate revenues and expenses for the item.</font>


**Change a Location/Sub-Location**


You can change the location/sub-location by selecting a different one  from the **Loc/Sub-Loc** field. Once  you change the location/sub-location, you will be prompted with a message  asking you whether you wish to change all the line item sub-locations  with the location/sub-location.

- Click **Yes** to replace the **Loc/Sub-Loc** column with the location/sub-location selected in the **Loc/Sub-Loc**  field.
- Click **No** to retain the original location/sub-location.



{:.note}
If you click **No**,  the location/sub-location displayed in the **Loc/Sub-Loc** column of the Item Details Grid does not change. The revenues and  expenses associated with the line item are allocated to the location/sub-location  specified in the **Loc/Sub-Loc** column  of the Item Details Grid.


To retain the line item location/sub-location, you should  have security rights assigned to you.
