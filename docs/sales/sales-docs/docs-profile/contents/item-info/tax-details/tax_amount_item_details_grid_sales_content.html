<p>Tax is computed on the item’s net sale  value (selling price less discount). It is the total of the tax amounts  calculated on each tax component of the tax code. The tax amount has a  decimal accuracy of six.</p>

<p class="note">A tax code consists of a set of individual tax components  that are applied together.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> A local  tax component and a state tax component might be combined into a tax code.</p>

<p>For a foreign currency document, the tax amount in the document currency  mode is expressed in terms of the foreign currency.</p>
