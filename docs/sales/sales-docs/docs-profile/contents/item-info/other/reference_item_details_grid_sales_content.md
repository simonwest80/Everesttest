# PO #/PR #


The **PO 
 #** column displays the number of the purchase order in the following  scenarios:

- When you create  a drop-ship purchase order.
- When you create  a linked purchase order from an existing sales order.



On receiving items on the purchase order, if you process the order to  a purchase receipt or invoice and the referenced sales order to an invoice  simultaneously, the purchase receipt/invoice number is displayed on the  **Sales Invoice** profile. If you  process the sales order to an invoice subsequently, the purchase order  number is displayed on the **Sales Invoice** profile.
