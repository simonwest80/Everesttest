 &gt; Manufacturers &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**),  the manufacturer's code is displayed in the **Manufacturer**  column. You can set up manufacturers in the **Manufacturer** profile (path: **Inventory &gt; 
 Manufacturers &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**). You cannot  edit this column.
