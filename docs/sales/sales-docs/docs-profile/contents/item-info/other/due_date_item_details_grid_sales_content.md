# Due Date


Enter the delivery date on which you expect a particular line item to  reach the customer, in this column. If this field is left blank, the line  item takes the delivery date specified for the document in the **Delivery****Date** field in the sales document.


If you enter a delivery date for the line item, and subsequently change  the date specified in the **Delivery****Date** field of a sales document  and save the document, a message is displayed stating that some line items  have delivery dates that are different from the document's delivery date.  The existing delivery dates of these line items will be retained.
