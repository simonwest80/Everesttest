# Pending Batch Payments 


If a batch payment is pending for a document, you will see the ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/batched_payments_pending.gif) icon displayed on the document status bar. Click the icon  to view the **Batch Payment Process**  browser.


{:.note}
The indicator is displayed on order and final documents  for any pending batch payment. It is, however, not displayed on closed  orders as **Everest** does not allow  you to make payments on such orders.
