# Credit Card Authorization


Authorizations obtained for credit card payments are indicated in the  **Credit card authorization** section  ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/batched_payments_pending.gif) of the status bar on sales document (sales order and  sales invoice) profiles. This section is visible only when you receive  payment through a credit card and have authorized it.


Authorization for a credit card payment is obtained by selecting the  **Pre-Authorization** option in the  **Card Verification** dialog box.

Click in this section to view the **Batch 
 Payment Process** browser. The [**Batch Payment Process** browser]({{site.acc_chm}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_browsers.html) allows  you to process the payment so that the funds are transferred to your account  from the customer's account by the financial institution with whom you  have an agreement.
