<p>You may want to charge your customer an additional amount/percentage  over the actual freight charges. This amount is treated as a profit while  shipping goods. It is not shown separately and is included in the freight  charge. This is called freight padding.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Freight Padding Applied</strong>  option to include the freight padding amount as part of the freight expenses.  If you have specified the freight padding amount/percentage in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/delivery_method_profile_rate_tab.html"><strong>Carrier</strong> profile</a> or in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/other-defaults/the_other_defaults_dialog_box.html"><strong>Other Defaults</strong> dialog box</a>, this  checkbox is selected by default.</p>
