# Shipment Tracking 


If you are not using any freight estimation software, enter  the tracking number provided to you by the carrier, in this field. This  field is relevant only for sales/credit orders and invoices/credit memos.  The shipment tracking number helps you track the shipment status of the  items ordered. The system automatically copies information entered in  this field to the **Shipment Tracking**  tab in sales documents.


If your shipping software is integrated with **Everest**,  press **Ctrl** + **Click**  the shipment tracking number link in sales orders/sales invoices to access  the shipping carrier's website, such as StarShip or WorldShip, where you  can obtain the delivery status.
