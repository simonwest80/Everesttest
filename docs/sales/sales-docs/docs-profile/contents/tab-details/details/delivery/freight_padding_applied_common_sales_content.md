# Freight Padding Applied


You may want to charge your customer an additional amount/percentage  over the actual freight charges. This amount is treated as a profit while  shipping goods. It is not shown separately and is included in the freight  charge. This is called freight padding.


Select the **Freight Padding Applied**  option to include the freight padding amount as part of the freight expenses.  If you have specified the freight padding amount/percentage in the [**Carrier** profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/misc/delivery_method_profile_rate_tab.html) or in the [**Other Defaults** dialog box]({{site.bp_chm}}/other-defaults/the_other_defaults_dialog_box.html), this  checkbox is selected by default.
