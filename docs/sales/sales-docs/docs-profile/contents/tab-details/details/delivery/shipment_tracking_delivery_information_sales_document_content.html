<p>If you are not using any freight estimation software, enter  the tracking number provided to you by the carrier, in this field. This  field is relevant only for sales/credit orders and invoices/credit memos.  The shipment tracking number helps you track the shipment status of the  items ordered. The system automatically copies information entered in  this field to the <strong>Shipment Tracking</strong>  tab in sales documents.</p>

<p>If your shipping software is integrated with <strong>Everest</strong>,  press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Click</strong>  the shipment tracking number link in sales orders/sales invoices to access  the shipping carrier’s website, such as StarShip or WorldShip, where you  can obtain the delivery status.</p>
