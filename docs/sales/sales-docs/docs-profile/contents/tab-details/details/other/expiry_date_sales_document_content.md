# Expiry Date


**The **Expiry 
 Date** field displays the date on which a sales quote or sales order  will become invalid. This field also helps in filtering expired sales  quotes, so that they can be purged using the **Purge**  utility.**


<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">In case of sales orders, 
 the expiry 
 date will be the date before which the order must be accepted or it may 
 even indicate the shipment schedule. </font>


{:.note}
An expired sales quote or order can still be converted  to an order or invoice. You can edit the expiration date field only in  a sales/credit quote.
