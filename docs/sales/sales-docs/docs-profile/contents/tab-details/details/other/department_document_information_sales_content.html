<h1 id="locsub-loc">Loc/Sub-Loc</h1>

<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field in a sales  document displays the location or the sub-location to which the document  belongs. When a quote, order or invoice is created the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field displays the location/sub-location assigned to the customer  in the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field (<strong>Customer</strong> profile <strong>&gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab). If required, you can select a different  location or sub-location.</p>

<p>When you select a customer code for the document and if the location/sub-location  assigned to the customer is different from that in the document, the system  informs you of the same and asks you whether you would like to change  the location/sub-location.</p>

<p class="note">When you assign a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of the sales documents by sub-location and print reports  for your management information purposes.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You  can generate a report of all the sales quotes raised from the Retail Department  to review the sales for the department.</p>

<p>Processed Documents</p>

<p>When a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to an  invoice, the location/sub-location specified in the original quote or  order is displayed in the converted order or invoice. You can change the  location/sub-location for a sales document before you post the sales journal.</p>

<p>Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers</p>

<p>The document’s location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Location/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected,  the address and logo of the sub-location’s location is used.</p>

<p class="note">You can set a preference by selecting the option <strong>Allow user to open only those invoicing documents 
 which belong to his/her default location/sub-location</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow
