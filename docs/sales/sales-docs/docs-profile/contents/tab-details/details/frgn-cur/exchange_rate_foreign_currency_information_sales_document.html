<h1 id="exchange-rate">Exchange Rate</h1>

<p>The <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field displays  the exchange rate for a foreign currency when a new foreign currency sales  document is created. The exchange rate displayed is the exchange rate  against your base currency.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> determines whether the  Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on the setting in the <strong>Rate for Sales Documents</strong> field (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency &gt; Exchange Rates</strong>).  Exchange rates can be entered with up to six decimals.</p>

<p>If the exchange rate for the document is different from the current  rate, then you can change the rate.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  a sale from a foreign customer is covered by a fixed rate contract (where  you contract to buy the foreign exchange at a specified rate) the exchange  rate for the document will be the exchange rate defined in the contract.</p>

<p class="note">When you convert a quote to an order or an order to  an invoice, the exchange rate displayed is the rate as per the quote/order.  If the rate has changed as on the invoice date, you must change the rate.</p>

<p>If there is a time lag between the creation of an intermediate document  and the final document, the exchange rate could fluctuate. <strong>Everest</strong>  allows you to take care of such situations by setting a preference in  the <strong>Exchange rate used when converting 
 quotes and orders</strong> field in the <strong>Documents</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Others &gt; Others 2</strong> tab). The option selected in the <strong>Exchange rate used when converting quotes and 
 orders</strong> field takes effect when you convert a sales quote to a sales  order or a sales order to a sales invoice.</p>

<p>The options available in this field are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Prompt 
 user with the exchange rate available as on date logged in</strong> - If  you select this option, <strong>Everest</strong> prompts  you with the latest exchange rate available on the login date (for the  document currency). Click <strong>Yes</strong>  to replace the exchange rate on the document with the latest exchange  rate. Click <strong>No</strong> to retain the existing  exchange rate on the document.</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 the exchange rate on the document being converted</strong> - If you select  this option, the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong> field  defaults to the exchange rate available on the document being processed.</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 the exchange rate available as on date logged in</strong> - If you select  this field, the <strong>Exchange Rate</strong>  field defaults to the latest exchange rate available on the login date.</li>
</ul>
