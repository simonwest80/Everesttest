<p>Foreign currency documents are sales documents that are created for a foreign currency customer (a customer whom you invoice in a currency other than your base currency).</p>

<p>In a foreign currency document:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The currency of the document is the same as the customer’s currency.</li>
  <li>The current exchange rate for the currency is displayed (this can be edited for the document).</li>
  <li>The document can be viewed in either the document’s currency or the base currency.</li>
  <li>The document amounts can be entered in either the base currency or the document currency. When switching to the other currency, then the amounts are translated using the exchange rate defined in the document.</li>
</ul>
