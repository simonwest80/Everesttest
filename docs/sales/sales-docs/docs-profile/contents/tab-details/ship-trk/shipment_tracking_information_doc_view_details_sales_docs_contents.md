Select this option (path: sales order profile **&gt; 
 Options &gt; Shipment Tracking Information**) to view the **Shipment 
 Tracking Information** browser.


This browser allows you to enter the tracking number for  the shipment. The tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system  using a bar code scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered  with different delivery methods for each shipment. Your online customers  can view the tracking number entered in this browser.


The shipment date defaults to the login date and the delivery  method defaults to the document's delivery method. You can change these  as required.


Use this browser when you ship items using multiple delivery  methods. If you ship the items using only one delivery method, you can  enter the shipment tracking number in the **Shipment 
 Tracking** field of the **Sales****Order** or **Sales 
 Invoice** profile.


If you have created a drop ship purchase order from a sales  order, the delivery method, the delivery date and the shipment tracking  number as entered in the drop ship purchase order, will be displayed in  this tab.
