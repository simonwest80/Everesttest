<h1 id="analysis-by-last-cost">Analysis by Last Cost</h1>

<p>When the analysis is by last cost, the current mark-up percentage and  the current margin is calculated using the selling price for the item  on the document and the last cost for the item.</p>

<p class="note">If the option <strong>Factor 
 Cost (enable cost inflation)</strong> is selected in the <strong>Other</strong><strong>Flow Control</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary</strong>  tab), the costs are inflated by the factor percentage for the item. However,  if the user has logged into extended mode, the costs displayed will not  include cost inflation.</p>

<p>The last cost is computed per sales measure of the item.</p>
