# Left Panel


The left panel of the **Customer Tracking 
 Pipeline** browser displays by default the **Customer 
 Tracking Pipeline**. This **** is  a diagrammatic representation of the customers who are tracked with the  tracking choices in the tracking group. Each ring in the pipeline represents  a tracking choice.


Click a section in the **Customer Tracking 
 Pipeline** to view the detailed breakup of the sales documents created  for customers who are tagged with the selected tracking choice. The sales  documents are listed in the [**Customer Document Details** section]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/customer_document_details_section_cust_tracking_pipeline.html).


{:.note}
The custom tracking group selected must be set up to  **disallow** multiple selections.  If multiple selections are allowed, the data in the report will be skewed  as the customer's data will be included in each of the selections.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The  tracking group 'How did you hear about us?' has 3 selections â€“ Web, Newspapers  and Televisions and it allows multiple selections. If customer ABC Inc  is tagged with all three, then the value of sales of ABC Inc  will be included in the total for each selection.
