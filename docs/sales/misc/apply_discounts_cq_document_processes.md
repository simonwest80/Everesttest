# Apply Discounts


Discounts are calculated based on the discount schemes that have been  set up for items in **Everest**.


The apply discounts option must be used in the following situations:

- When the option  **Automatically apply item discounts applicable 
 to a customer when retrieving the item on a document** is not selected  in the **Documents** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document Payments** tab). In this case, discounts are calculated and applied if the  **Apply Discounts** option is selected.
- When modifications  are made to the discounts applied. If you select the **Apply 
 Discounts** option, **Everest**  re-calculates discounts available to the customer on all the items and  overwrites the modifications made.



{:.steps}
To apply discounts, do the following:

- From the **Credit Quote/Credit Order/Credit Memo** profile,  select **Options &gt; Customer** > **Apply Discounts**.



The discounts defined for the customer are applied to the item. You  can view these discounts in the **Discount 
 Value** and **Discount %** columns  of the Item Details Grid.
