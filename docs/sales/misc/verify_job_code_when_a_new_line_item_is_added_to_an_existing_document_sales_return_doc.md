# Verify Job Code When a New Line Item is Added to an Existing Document


When a new item is added to an existing sales return document to which  a job code has already been assigned, you will be prompted with a message  that states that a job code has been used in the document. You will be  asked whether you wish to apply the existing job code to the line item.  Click **Yes** if you want to assign  the existing job code to the line item or **No**  to return to the document.
