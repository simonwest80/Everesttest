<p><strong>Currency</strong></p>

<p>You can choose the currency the sales document has to appear in, while  sending the document by e-mail  to the customer. It has the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Print 
 in Base Currency</strong> - Select this option if you want the document  that you send by e-mail,  to be in the base currency, irrespective of the currency defined for the  customer. The <strong>Currency</strong> field defaults  to this option.</li>
  <li><strong>Print 
 in Document Currency</strong> - Select this option if you want the document  that you send by e-mail,  to be in the currency defined for the customer selected in the document.</li>
  <li><strong>Print 
 in both Base and Document Currency</strong> - Select this option if you  want the document that you send by e-mail,  to be in the currency defined for the customer selected in the document.  However, the document and the tax totals are displayed additionally in  the base currency at the bottom right hand side of the document.</li>
</ul>

<dl>

  <dd>Select this check box if you want to display the  break up of the total tax into the amounts for each tax component, in  the sales document.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Print tax component details</strong></dt>

 &gt; Tax Components &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</dd>
  <dd>If there are one or two tax components on the document,  they will be displayed separately in the right hand corner at the bottom,  along with the other document total details. If there are more than two  tax components on the document, the first tax component will be displayed  separately while the remaining tax components will be grouped and displayed  under the heading <strong>Others</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>If you do not select the <strong>Print</strong><strong>Tax</strong> <strong>Component</strong><strong>Details</strong> check box, the break up  of the tax components on the document will not be displayed. The total  tax amount will be displayed against the heading <strong>Total 
 Tax</strong>.</dd>
