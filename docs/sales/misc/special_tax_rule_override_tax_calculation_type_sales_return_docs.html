<h1 id="special-tax-rule-override">Special Tax Rule Override</h1>

<p>If you have defined a special tax rule for the jurisdiction specified  in the sales return document, select the <strong>Special 
 tax rule override</strong> option to apply the tax code specified in the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> profile (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes 
 &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>).</p>

<p class="note">The <strong>Document Override</strong> check box in the <strong>Rules</strong>  tab of the <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> profile  has to be selected.</p>

<p>If the option selected in the <strong>Tax Calculation 
 Type</strong> field was previously set to <strong>Manual</strong><strong>override</strong> or <strong>Automatic</strong>,  and you have selected <strong>Special tax rule 
 override</strong>, the tax code as defined in the <strong>Special 
 Tax Rules</strong> profile is applied.</p>

<p>If no special tax rule has been specified for the jurisdiction, you  will be prompted with a message that says that you cannot override tax  and no record with an override option has been found in the <strong>Special 
 Tax Rules</strong> profile. Click <strong>OK</strong>  to return to the sales return document.</p>

<p>When a new item is added to the document, the tax code defined in the  <strong>Special Tax Rules</strong> profile (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>)  is also applied to the new items.</p>

<p class="note">When you manually change the tax code, the <strong>Tax 
 Calculation Type</strong> field displays the <strong>Manual 
 override</strong> option.</p>
