The refund is marked for batch  processing and is transferred to <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_browsers.html"><strong>Batch Payment Process</strong> browser</a>. These  refunds can be processed at a later stage.</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> Refunds  are made through credit card on orders placed with your company. Using  this option, you can process all of them at the end of the day in a batch  instead of processing them one by one.</dd>

 Printing</strong> dialog box</a>.</dd>
