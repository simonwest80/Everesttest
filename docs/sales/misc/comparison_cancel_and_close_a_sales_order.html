<p>This section provides a comparison between canceling and closing a sales/credit  order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Orders that  cannot be canceled can be marked as closed. An order cannot be canceled  when it has a payment history or when it is a backorder.</li>
  <li>When an order  is canceled, the entire order is annulled and it reverts back to a sales/credit  quote. Closing an order merely marks the order as closed and these orders  can be viewed in the <strong>Shipped Sales/Credit 
 Orders</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
