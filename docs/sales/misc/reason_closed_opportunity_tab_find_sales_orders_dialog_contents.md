# Reason Closed


This field allows you to search for sales orders based on the reason  it was closed. The reason is defined in the sales opportunity associated  with the order.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you close an opportunity for the reason that the opportunity is converted  to an order, you can use this in the search parameter.


{:.note}
For sales orders created directly (without creating  a sales opportunity first), the reason closed is not assigned by default  in the **Sales Opportunity** profile.  Unless you enter the reason closed on the **Sales 
 Opportunity** profile, the orders will not appear in the search result.


You can select  multiple reasons for closure in this field.
