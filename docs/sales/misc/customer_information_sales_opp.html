  <dt><strong>Customer Code</strong></dt>
  <dd>The <strong>Customer Code</strong> identifies the customer for whom the opportunity is created. You  can create several opportunities for each customer. The customer can be  an existing customer or a prospective one. If you are creating the opportunity  for a prospective customer, you must first create a customer account.</dd>

  <dd>When you access the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunity</strong> profile from within a sales quote, order or invoice,  this field displays the customer code for that document.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Sales Rep</strong></dt>
  <dd>This field <em>**</em> identifies  the Sales Representative responsible for the opportunity. The sales representative  assigned to the opportunity can be different from the default sales representative  of the customer.</dd>
  <dd>When a sales quote, order or invoice is created  directly, this field displays the sales representative for that document.  However, if the sales opportunity is converted to a sales quote by another  sales representative, the representative who created the sales opportunity  is displayed by default in the <strong>Sales 
 Rep</strong> field. You can change the sales representative for the document.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">Sales commission is calculated on the basis of sales  invoices and not sales opportunities. The sales representative specified  in the sales invoice becomes eligible for the sales commission.</p>
