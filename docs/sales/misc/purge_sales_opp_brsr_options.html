<p>This option allows you to purge opportunities provided you have the  required security right to do so. <strong>Everest</strong>  asks you to confirm your selection.</p>

<p>You can purge multiple documents at once.</p>

<p>Back-end processes</p>

<p>The following back-end processes occur when you purge an opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The purged opportunities  are not displayed in the sales funnel.</li>
  <li>They cease to be  system documents and cannot be retrieved for any purpose.</li>
  <li>The sequence numbers  of such documents cannot be reused.</li>
  <li>The history of  purged opportunities is no longer maintained in the database. It gets  purged from the various browsers that would have recorded the history  of the purged opportunities; for instance, Event History, Tasks History,  Appointment History, and Sales Opportunity History.</li>
  <li>The purged opportunities  are disassociated from any tracking choices they are tagged to.</li>
</ul>
