<p>The zip or postal code of the  document’s location/sub-location is displayed by default. You can change  the zip code from where the shipment originated if required.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If you  create the document in one location but your warehouse is located elsewhere,  you can change the zip/ postal code of the Ship From Address.</p>

<p>The zip or postal code is picked up from the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: File &gt; Setup &gt;  Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New  Window).</p>

<p>This field is displayed only if you select the <strong>Zip/Postal
