# Purchase Order Status Browser


The **Purchase Order Status** browser displays the following:

- Document #
- Vendor
- Item
- Order Quantity
- Cost



Highlight the required document and select **Open Document** from the right-click menu to view the **Purchase Order** profile.


The **PO #** column in the Item Details Grid of the sales order is NOT automatically updated with the purchase order number as it is NOT a drop ship or linked purchase order.
