# Source of Opportunity


This field allows you to search for sales orders using the source of  opportunity defined in the **Sales****Opportunity** profile associated  with the order.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you select 'Magazine Advertisement',  the search result will display all sales orders with the opportunity source  - Magazine Advertisement.


{:.note}
For sales orders created directly (without creating  a sales opportunity first), the source of opportunity is not assigned  by default in the **Sales Opportunity** profile.  Unless you enter the source of opportunity, the orders will NOT appear  in the search result.


You can select multiple sources.
