# When the Sales Order Document is Open 


If the sales order document is open in another window or by another  user and you save the purchase receipt or invoice, you will see a message  stating that the sales order is locked. You will also have the option  of saving the purchase receipt/invoice without assigning the items to  the sales order.

- Click **Yes** to create the purchase receipt/invoice  without assigning the items to the sales order.
- Click **No** to cancel the purchase receipt/invoice.



You have to close the original **Sales 
 Order** profile before you process the purchase receipt/invoice.


When a drop ship purchase order is automatically created out of a sales  order, the delivery date on the **Sales 
 Order** profile is updated with the delivery date of the purchase  order.
