title: Printing Company Information
---


The **Company Information** field  allows you to select the address and logo that have to be printed. The  options are detailed below:


| Option | Select the option: |
| Logo Bitmap | To print both the company's logo and address on the  document. |
| Text Only | To print the company's name and address as text. |
| None | If you are using pre-printed stationery. The company's  name and address are not printed. |



{:.note}
The address and logo printed is the address/logo of  the location of the document's department (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/ Department &gt; Options**  > Edit > **In 
 New Window** > **Image** tab).  If the address/logo has not been assigned to the documents department,  then the address/logo of the default department specified in the **Default Location** field (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab) is used.
