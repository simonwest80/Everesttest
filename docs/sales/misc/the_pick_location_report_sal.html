<h1 id="the-pick-location-report">The Pick Location Report</h1>

<p>The <strong>Pick Location</strong>  report displays the stock bin location where inventory should picked.   This report  is an alterative to using Pull Sheets and Pick Tickets.  It  is most effective for companies for they do not need help in identifying  the orders that need to be shipped.</p>

<p>Select the <strong>Print Pick Location</strong>  option for the document highlighted in the Sales Orders Browser to Print  the Pick Location Report. The <strong>Print Preferences</strong>  dialog box is displayed wherein you can specify the number of copies of  the report that you require.</p>

<p>On the <strong>Pick Location</strong>  report, for drop ship items, the <strong>Stock 
 Bin</strong> column displays “<strong>DS</strong>”  for drop ship. An <strong>asterisk</strong> (*****) next to the stock bin, for example  *CCSA, indicates that the line item is fully committed.</p>
