<p>If the sales order document has been opened in another window or by  another user and you save the purchase receipt/invoice, you will see a  message stating that the sales order is locked. You will also have the  option of saving the purchase receipt/invoice without assigning the items  to the sales order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create the purchase receipt/invoice  without assigning the items to the Sales order.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>No</strong> to cancel the purchase receipt/invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to close the original <strong>Sales
