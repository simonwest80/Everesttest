---


Select the delivery method through whom the items are to be shipped.  The delivery method defined in the Ship  Via field of the document profile is displayed by default. The  rate shop is set for each shipping agent and includes the transportation,  insurance, residential and COD charges. The carrier has to be identified  in the **Delivery Method** profile  of the delivery method for the document. If you change the delivery method  in this field, and update the document with the freight charges, the **Ship Via** field in the document profile  also reflects the changes made.
