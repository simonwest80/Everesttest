The current rate of exchange between the bank currency and the base currency defined in the **Exchange Rate** profile (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Multi - Currency &gt; 
Exchange Rates** > **Options** > **New** > **In New Window**) is displayed. You can change this rate if required. When you change the rate, the **Amount** field of the bank currency section also correspondingly changes.
