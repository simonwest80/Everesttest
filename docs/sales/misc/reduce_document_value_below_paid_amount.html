<h1 id="reduce-document-value-below-paid-amount">Reduce Document Value Below Paid Amount</h1>

<p>If you reduce the value of a sales order or invoice after payment of  the full amount, say by reducing the price or changing the tax code, <strong>Everest</strong> informs you that the document  is overpaid and provides you three options to proceed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Refund 
 the Overpayment</strong> - Difference between the amount received and the  reduced document value is referred to as ‘overpayment’. Select this option  to return the excess amount received to the customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply 
 Overpayment as Customer Deposit</strong> – Select this option to retain  the overpayment as a deposit that you can apply to any other sales document.  A manual sales order is created to account for this deposit.</li>
  <li><strong>Save 
 the Document with a Negative Balance</strong> - If you decide to save the  document with a negative balance, the amount remains overpaid and can  be applied to another sales order or invoice created for the same customer.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you select <strong>Refund the Overpayment</strong>  or <strong>Apply Overpayment as Customer Deposit</strong>  options, the <strong>Refund Payment to Customers</strong>  dialog box is displayed. The <strong>Amount</strong>  field is disabled, which implies that only the exact amount overpaid can  be refunded or applied as customer deposit. You can use any payment method  to make the refund.</p>

<p>Multicurrency  Documents</p>

<p>In case of multicurrency  documents, enter the amount to be refunded or applied as customer deposit.</p>

<p>If the amount refunded or applied as a deposit is less than the overpayment,  <strong>Everest</strong> informs you of the same  and does not allow you to proceed.</p>

<p>For multicurrency  documents, the following changes are additionally effected:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Refund 
 the Overpayment</strong> - The difference between the exchange rate at the  time of receipt and refund is treated as the exchange gain or loss for  the transaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply 
 Overpayment as Customer Deposit</strong> – The manual sales order uses the  exchange rate at which the amount is originally received.</li>
</ul>
