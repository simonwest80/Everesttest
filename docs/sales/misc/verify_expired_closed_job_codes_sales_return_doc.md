# Verify Expired/Closed Job Codes


When a job code is assigned to a line item in a sales return document, **Everest** verifies if the job code has a status that is **Closed** and/or **Expired**. If the job code has a status that is closed and/or expired, you will be prompted with a message that says that the job code is closed and/or expired. You will also be asked if you still wish to use the job code. Click **Yes** to use the job code. You need appropriate security rights to assign a job code that is closed and/or expired, to a line item. Click **No** if you do not wish to assign the job code to the line item in the sales return document.
