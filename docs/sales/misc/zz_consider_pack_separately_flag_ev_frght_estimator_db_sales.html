<p>If this option is checked, each unit of sales measure of the line item  will be packed separately from the other sales unit of the same line item.</p>

<p class="example">Eggs are sold in dozens only. If 10 quantities of eggs are sold on a  sales order, it implies that 10 dozen eggs are sold.</p>
