If you have specified a special price for the freight charged on documents,  **Everest** calculates and displays  the amount in this field. You can specify special pricing for freight  charged on documents in the **Special Pricing**  dialog box by specifying **Freight**  in the **Discount** **Type**  field (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Discounts &gt; Special Pricing &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New
