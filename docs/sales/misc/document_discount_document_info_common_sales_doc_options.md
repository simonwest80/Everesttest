# Document Discount


The **Document Discount** option  (path: **Sales Document** profile **&gt; Options &gt; Document &gt; Document Discount**)  brings up the **Document Discount** dialog  box. The document discount allows you to apply a global discount on all  items in the document.


**Discount**
: Use this option to specify a discount percentage  to be applied to all line items in the document.


**Exclude already reduced items**
: If you select this check box, the discount specified  in the **Discount** field is not applicable  to:

- An item that  already has a discount specified.
- A line item  whose price is less than the price specified in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Items** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Sales** tab).



![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) If  the price of a line item is less than the price specified in the **Item** profile, global discount is still  applied even if this check box is selected. It is excluded only if the  price is changed manually.
