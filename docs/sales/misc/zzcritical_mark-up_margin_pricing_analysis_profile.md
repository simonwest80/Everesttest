title: Critical Mark-up/Margin
---


Critical margin/markup is set up to ensure that the gross margins cover  at least operational costs. Enter the absolute minimal (critical) mark-up  or margin for a sale in this field. This setting can be bypassed if the  user has appropriate security rights. Typically, a sales manager can be  given rights to change this value.


{:.note}
The **Critical mark-up/margin**  must be less than the **Minimum mark-up/margin**.
