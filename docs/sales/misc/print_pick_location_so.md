# Print Pick Location


Select this option to print the **Pick 
 Location** report for the document highlighted in the **Sales 
 Orders** browser. The **Print 
 Preferences** dialog box is displayed wherein you can specify  the number of copies of the report that you require.


Once you have printed or previewed the report, you are asked if you  wish to mark the items on the sales order as printed in the **Pick 
 Location** report.


If some of the items are previously printed, you are reminded of the  same and asked if you require duplicate copies.


On the **Pick Location** report,  for drop ship items, the **Stock Bin**  column displays “**DS**” for drop  ship. An **asterisk** (*****)  next to the stock bin, for example \*CCSA, indicates that the line item  is fully committed.
