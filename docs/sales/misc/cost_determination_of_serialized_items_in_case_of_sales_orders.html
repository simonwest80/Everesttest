<p>For serialized items, <strong>Everest</strong>  calculates the <strong>Actual/Average Cost</strong>  in the <strong>Pricing Analysis</strong> browser  based on the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When items  are fully committed in the sales order, <strong>Everest</strong>  calculates the <strong>Actual/Average cost</strong>  based on the average of the actual cost of serial numbers committed.</li>
  <li>If items are  partially committed, the <strong>Actual/Average 
 cost</strong> is equal to the (Sum of actual cost of serial numbers)+(current  average cost of the item X quantity not committed)/total quantity on order.</li>
  <li>If no items  are committed, the <strong>Actual/Average cost</strong>  displayed is the current average cost of the item.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the analysis is by <strong>Average Cost 
 (previous document save)</strong>, then the <strong>Actual/Average</strong><strong>Cost</strong> is determined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When items  are fully committed, the <strong>Actual/Average 
 Cost</strong> is the average of the actual cost of serial numbers committed.</li>
  <li>When the items  are partially committed, it is equal to the (Sum of actual cost of serial  numbers)+( last saved average cost of the item X quantity not committed)/total  quantity on order.</li>
  <li>If no items  are committed, it is the last saved average cost of the item.</li>
</ul>
