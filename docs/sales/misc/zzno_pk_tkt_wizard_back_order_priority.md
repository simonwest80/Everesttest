If you select **No**, sales orders  display in the order specified in the **Sales 
 Order Priority** section. **No** is  selected by default.


{:.note}
The sort order of the **Pick 
 Ticket** browser cannot be modified from the browser. It is therefore  important that you decide the required sort order in the Priority section  of the Pull Sheet Wizard.
