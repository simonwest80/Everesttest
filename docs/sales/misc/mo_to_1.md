**MO/TO**


MO is the abbreviation for Mail Order and TO for Telephone Order. Transactions  where card details are provided by the cardholder over the phone or by  mail are called MO/TO transactions. MO/TO transactions are also known  as card-not-present transactions. In such transactions, authorization  has to be obtained first. The funds are normally captured only after the  items have been shipped to the cardholder. Visa and MasterCard  in the United States allow capture of funds on MOTO  transactions only after delivery.
