# Item Transfer for Sales Orders


The **Item Transfer** menu option  on the sales order allows you to transfer items to another stock area  of the same type. The items must meet the following requirements to be  eligible for the transfer:

- The items must  be inventoried.
- The items must  be committed on the sales order.



This process differs slightly from item transfers on other sales documents  in that the items do not need to be serialized.


When you select the **Options &gt; Item 
 &gt; Item Transfer** menu option from the sales order, the system  displays the **Item 
 Transfer for all Items** browser, where you can select the items  to transfer.


The **Item Transfer** menu option  from within the sales order automatically creates a stock transfer document  for that particular transfer. The system also updates the inventory history  as well as the serial number history for all serialized items that are  transferred.
