**Voice Authorizations**


Sometimes processing networks decline transactions with a referral message indicating that the merchant must call the cardholder's issuing bank to complete the transaction. The payment information is then submitted over the phone. If the transaction is approved, the merchant is provided with an authorization code for the transaction. This process is called voice authorization.
