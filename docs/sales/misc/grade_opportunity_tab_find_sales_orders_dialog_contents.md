# Grade


This field allows you to search for sales orders using the grade defined  in the sales opportunity associated with the order.


{:.note}
For sales orders created directly (without creating  a sales opportunity first), no sales grade is assigned by default in the  **Sales Opportunity** profile. Unless  you enter the grade in the **Sales Opportunity**  profile, the orders will not appear in the search result.


You can select multiple grades.
