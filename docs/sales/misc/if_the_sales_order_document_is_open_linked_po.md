# When Sales Order Document is Open


If the sales order document has been opened in another window or by  another user and you save the purchase receipt/invoice, you will see a  message stating that the sales order is locked. You will also have the  option of saving the purchase receipt/invoice without assigning the items  to the sales order.

- Click **Yes** to create the purchase receipt/invoice  without assigning the items to the Sales order.
- Click **No** to cancel the purchase receipt/invoice.



You have to close the original **Sales 
 Order** profile before you process the purchase receipt/invoice.
