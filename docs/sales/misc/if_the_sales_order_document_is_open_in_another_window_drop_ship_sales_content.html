<p>If the sales order document is open in another window or by another  user and you save the purchase receipt or invoice, you will see a message  stating that the sales order is locked. You will also have the option  of saving the purchase receipt/invoice without assigning the items to  the sales order.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to create the purchase receipt/invoice  without assigning the items to the sales order.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>No</strong> to cancel the purchase receipt/invoice.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have to close the original <strong>Sales 
 Order</strong> profile before you process the purchase receipt/invoice.</p>

<p>When a drop ship purchase order is automatically created out of a sales  order, the delivery date on the <strong>Sales 
 Order</strong> profile is updated with the delivery date of the purchase  order.</p>
