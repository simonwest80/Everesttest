# Purge a Sales Opportunity


This option allows you to purge opportunities provided you have the  required security right to do so. **Everest**  asks you to confirm your selection.


You can purge multiple documents at once.


Back-end processes


The following back-end processes occur when you purge an opportunity:

- The purged opportunities  are not displayed in the sales funnel.
- They cease to be  system documents and cannot be retrieved for any purpose.
- The sequence numbers  of such documents cannot be reused.
- The history of  purged opportunities is no longer maintained in the database. It gets  purged from the various browsers that would have recorded the history  of the purged opportunities; for instance, Event History, Tasks History,  Appointment History, and Sales Opportunity History.
- The purged opportunities  are disassociated from any tracking choices they are tagged to.
