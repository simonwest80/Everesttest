<h1 id="reason-closed">Reason Closed</h1>

<p>This field allows you to search for sales orders based on the reason  it was closed. The reason is defined in the sales opportunity associated  with the order.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  you close an opportunity for the reason that the opportunity is converted  to an order, you can use this in the search parameter.</p>

<p class="note">For sales orders created directly (without creating  a sales opportunity first), the reason closed is not assigned by default  in the <strong>Sales Opportunity</strong> profile.  Unless you enter the reason closed on the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunity</strong> profile, the orders will not appear in the search result.</p>

<p>You can select  multiple reasons for closure in this field.</p>
