title: Closed Pull Sheet
---


Select this option to view a closed pull sheet.


A 'Closed' pull sheet is one on which all the ordered items have been  committed. Pull sheets can also be marked as 'closed' manually. A closed  pull sheet can merely be printed or processed to an invoice.


The drop-down button beside this field allows you to specify the pull  sheet number. It is mandatory to specify the pull sheet number if you  select the **Closed Pull Sheet** option.


{:.note}
Items  CANNOT be committed on a closed pull sheet. You can print pick tickets  for pull sheets that have already been created by selecting the **Closed Pull Sheet** option.


If another user has opened an exiting pull sheet, it  is locked so that other users cannot modify it at the same time. When  you select the **Open Pull Sheet** or  **Closed Pull Sheet** option in such  a case, **Everest** informs you that  the pull sheet has been locked by another user and can be opened only  for viewing. Click **Yes** to view  the pull sheet.
