</dl>

<ul>
  <li>: 1590  dated 1st June 2007</li>
  <li>: 1100  dated 16th May 2007</li>
  <li>: 1025  dated 15th May 2007</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The sort order of the <strong>Pick 
 Ticket</strong> browser cannot be modified from the browser. It is therefore  important that you decide the required sort order in this section.</p>
