<p>Select this option to scan items by Model No., Item Code,  Item Alias or Serial Number from the <strong>Commit 
 Inventory</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Commit Inventory</strong> from the  <strong>Sales Orders</strong> browser or profile).  You can set the sequence of the order by which <strong>Everest</strong>  will retrieve the item by setting flow control preferences (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Items</strong>  &gt; <strong>Item Details</strong> tab).</p>

<p>All inventoried, serialized and auto-serialized items can  be scanned. Every correct entry increases the quantity in the Committed  column of the sales order by the quantity in the <strong>Qty</strong>  field of the <strong>Commit Inventory</strong>  dialog box. The <strong>Qty</strong> field defaults  to 1, but with the appropriate security right, you can change the quantity  for regular items. Serial numbers always scan as 1 unit and the quantity  cannot be changed.</p>

<p>To prevent mistakes, this screen flashes a red signal and  sounds a beep for an invalid entry. An invalid scan message is indicated  both visually and audibly for the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Item does not exist.</li>
  <li>Quantity exceeds  order quantity.</li>
  <li>Item is not in  document list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click the <strong>History</strong> button to  view the history of all scan attempts/actions.</p>
