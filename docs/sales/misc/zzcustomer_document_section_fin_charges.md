title: Customer Document Section
---


When you highlight a customer in the **Finance 
 Charges** section, all documents belonging to the customer on which  finance charges are levied are displayed in the **Customer 
 Document** section. The check boxes in the document grid are enabled  only if you select a customer in the **Finance 
 Charges** section.


All the documents, belonging to the customer, that are due for payment  are automatically selected. You can deselect  documents as required.


The columns in this section display the number of the sales document,  the date of its creation and the date when the payment was due by the  customer. The actual total of the document, the amount paid and the balance  due are also displayed.


{:.note}
The account that is affected when finance charges are  accrued is specified in the **Finance Charge**  field of the **Accounting** dialog  box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Revenue Accounts** tab).
