title: Batch Processing
---


This option allows you to process credit card refunds in batches. When  the check box is selected, the authorization of the transactions and capturing  of funds takes place later. The refund is marked for batch processing  and is transferred to **Batch Credit Card 
 Process** browser. These refunds can be processed at a later stage.


Refunds are made through credit card on orders placed with your company.  Using this option, you can process all of them at the end of the day in  a batch instead of processing them one by one.
