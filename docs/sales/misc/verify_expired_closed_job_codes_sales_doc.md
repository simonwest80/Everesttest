# Verify Expired/Closed Job Codes


When you assign a job code to a line item in a sales document, **Everest** verifies if the job code has  a status that is **Closed** and/or  **Expired**. If the job code has a  status that is closed and/or expired, you are prompted with a message  and asked if you still wish to use the job code.


You need appropriate security rights to assign a job code that is closed  and/or expired, to a line item.
