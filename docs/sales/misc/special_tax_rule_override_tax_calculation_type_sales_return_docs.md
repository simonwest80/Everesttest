# Special Tax Rule Override


If you have defined a special tax rule for the jurisdiction specified  in the sales return document, select the **Special 
 tax rule override** option to apply the tax code specified in the **Special Tax Rules** profile (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes 
 &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**).


{:.note}
The **Document Override** check box in the **Rules**  tab of the **Special Tax Rules** profile  has to be selected.


If the option selected in the **Tax Calculation 
 Type** field was previously set to **Manual****override** or **Automatic**,  and you have selected **Special tax rule 
 override**, the tax code as defined in the **Special 
 Tax Rules** profile is applied.


If no special tax rule has been specified for the jurisdiction, you  will be prompted with a message that says that you cannot override tax  and no record with an override option has been found in the **Special 
 Tax Rules** profile. Click **OK**  to return to the sales return document.


When a new item is added to the document, the tax code defined in the  **Special Tax Rules** profile (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; 
 Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**)  is also applied to the new items.


{:.note}
When you manually change the tax code, the **Tax 
 Calculation Type** field displays the **Manual 
 override** option.
