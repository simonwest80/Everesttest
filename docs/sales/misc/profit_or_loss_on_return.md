# Profit or Loss on Returns


Profit or loss on return is calculated automatically only for inventoried  items.


**Serialized items**


The profit or loss on return of a serialized/auto-serialized item is  calculated using the following formula:


(Item Price in Credit Memo - Discount in Credit Memo) \* Quantity Returned  - (Actual Price of items returned \* Quantity Returned)


If the return value exceeds the actual price of items returned, then  it is a profit on return; otherwise it is a loss.


**Non-serialized items**


The profit or loss on the return of a non-serialized item is calculated  using the following formula:


(Item Price – Discount)\*Quantity Returned – (Price at the time of return\*  Quantity of items returned)


If the return value exceeds the average cost of items returned, then  it is a profit on return; otherwise it is a loss.
