The current rate of exchange between the bank currency and the base  currency defined in the **Exchange Rate**  profile (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Multi** - **Currency**  > **Exchange** **Rates**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New** **Window**)  is displayed. You can change this rate if required. When you change the  rate, the **Amount** fields of the  bank currency section also correspondingly changes.
