<p>Every time an item is correctly scanned or entered in the  <strong>Scan or type product details</strong> field,  the quantity in the <strong>Qty</strong> field  increases by 1.</p>

<p>The <strong>Qty</strong> field defaults  to 1 for each entry, but with the appropriate security right, you can  change the quantity for regular items. Serial numbers always scan as 1  unit and the quantity cannot be changed.</p>

<p>When committed, the quantity in the <strong>Qty</strong>  field of the <strong>Commit Inventory</strong>  dialog box increases the quantity in the Committed column of the sales  order for the line item.</p>
