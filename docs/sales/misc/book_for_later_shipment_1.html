    <p><strong>Book for Later Shipment</strong></p>

<p>Where there is a time gap between the delivery of goods or services and the time of order, (for e.g., in mail order shipments) then funds can be blocked from the cardholder’s account.  Such blocking of funds is called ‘booking for later payment’. When the goods and services are delivered, another request is sent to capture the funds. Booking for later shipment is similar to authorization.</p>
