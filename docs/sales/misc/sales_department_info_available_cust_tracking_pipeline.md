# Sales Department


The sales department would ideally like to plan their sales effort and  assess the sales team based on the **Customer 
 Tracking Pipeline**.

- The geographical  distribution of opportunities or sales can be ascertained by selecting  the tracking group set up for geographical regions. The **Tracking 
 Group** can be selected in the **Upper 
 right panel** of the **Customer Tracking 
 Pipeline** browser. This data enables the sales planning effort region  wise.
- You can also  assess the performance of the sales team in different geographical locations.
