# Comparison - Cancel and Close a Sales/Credit Order


This section provides a comparison between canceling and closing a sales/credit  order.

- Orders that  cannot be canceled can be marked as closed. An order cannot be canceled  when it has a payment history or when it is a backorder.
- When an order  is canceled, the entire order is annulled and it reverts back to a sales/credit  quote. Closing an order merely marks the order as closed and these orders  can be viewed in the **Shipped Sales/Credit 
 Orders** browser.
