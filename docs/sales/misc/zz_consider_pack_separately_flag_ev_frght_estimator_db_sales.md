title: Consider Pack Separately Flag
---


If this option is checked, each unit of sales measure of the line item  will be packed separately from the other sales unit of the same line item.


{:.example}
Eggs are sold in dozens only. If 10 quantities of eggs are sold on a  sales order, it implies that 10 dozen eggs are sold.

- If this option  is **not** selected, all 10 dozen  will be packed together in one package.
- If this option  is selected, it would mean that each dozen is packed separately, resulting  in 10 packages containing 1 dozen eggs in each package.
