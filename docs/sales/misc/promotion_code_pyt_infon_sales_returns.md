# Promotion Code


Promotions or promotional campaigns are methods by which you can increase  your sales. You can offer discounts or free gifts on certain items for  a certain period to attract more customers.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You can  offer 10% discount to customers who buy goods from Dec 15th to Jan 15th,  and also track expenses and revenues associated with the promotion.


Promotion codes are used in sales return documents to keep track of  revenues that occur because of promotion campaigns. You may also want  to track the source of a sale based on promotion codes for the following  reasons:

- To compute  the profits of printing a promotion campaign catalog.
- To gauge the  effectiveness of advertising and campaigns based on source of sales.



A promotion code is defined in the **Promotion 
 Profile** (path: **Inventory &gt; 
 Discounts &gt; Promotions** > **Options**  > **Edit** **&gt; 
 In New Window**).

Promotion codes can be associated with a special pricing that has been  defined in the **Special Pricing Details** section of the **Special Pricing**  dialog box. You can associate a promotion code to a special pricing by  selecting the **Promotion Code Required** check box and specifying a promotion code in the **Promotion**  field of the **Special Pricing** dialog  box (path: **Inventory &gt; Discounts &gt; 
 Special Pricing &gt;** **Special Pricing** browser > **Options &gt; New 
 &gt; In New Window**).

The **Promotion Code** field in  the sales return document allows you to specify the promotion code that  is to be applied to the document. If you have specified a special price  for the promotion code in the **Special 
 Pricing** dialog box, and you select the promotion code in the **Promotion Code** field, **Everest**  will prompt you with a message asking you whether you want to:

- **Keep 
 the current prices** - If you select this option, the price of the  item will not change. You are Â allowed  to retain pricing on the document if you have adequate security rights.
- **Update 
 prices based on the new promotion** - If you select this option,  the price is recalculated based on the price specified in the **Special 
 Pricing** dialog box. The updated price for the particular item is  then populated in the **Item** **Price** column of the sales return document.
