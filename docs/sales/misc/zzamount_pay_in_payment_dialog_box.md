The amount in customer's or document currency displayed in the **Amount** field of the **Document Currency** section is automatically displayed in this field. When you change the payment currency, the exchange rate defined in **Exchange Rate** profile is used to arrive at this amount.


This amount can be edited as required. When you edit this amount, the **Amount** fields of the bank currency, base currency and document currency sections get updated automatically, using the existing exchange rates.
