# Authorization


An authorization is a request to charge a cardholder. When a charge  is authorized, the cardholder's available limit reduces, but the funds  are not actually captured. The card is not billed until a request is made  by the merchant to capture the transaction.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Your  customer, who has a credit limit of $10,000, places an order for goods  worth $4000. The available limit reduces to $6000 although the customer  is not required to pay the $4000 until you send a request with the authorization  code for capturing the funds. The funds are then transferred to your account  and the customer's account is debited.
