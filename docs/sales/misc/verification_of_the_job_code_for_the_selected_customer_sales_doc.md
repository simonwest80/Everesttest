# Verification of the Job Code for the Selected Customer


If a job code is associated to a customer and you retrieve that customer  in a sales document, you are informed that one or more open job codes  exist for the customer. You are further asked if you would like to use  the job code for the document.


The customer code attached to the job code may NOT match the customer  code defined in the billing address of a sales document. You are prompted  with a message that says that the selected job code is not assigned to  the customer. You are asked if you still wish to use the job code.


You need appropriate security rights to assign a job code that is not  assigned to a customer, to a line item.
