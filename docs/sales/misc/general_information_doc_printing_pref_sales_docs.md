| Sales Document (Dot Matrix) | This format is suitable if you print your documents  on a dot matrix printer. |
| Sales Document Double Line | In this format, an item is printed in two lines with  the item's extended description appearing in the second line. The first  line displays the item's code, model, and brand. |
| Sales Document (WOIC) | In this format, the item's code is displayed in the  first line with only the item's description appearing in the second line. |


**Print using quick report**

 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location** > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window**).
