# Reason Closed Choice


This field allows you to search for documents based on the reason for  closing the opportunity associated with the document.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you close an opportunity because it is converted to a sales quote, you  can use this in the search parameter.


{:.note}
If you create sales documents directly, a reason closed  choice is not assigned to the sales opportunity.


Unless  you input this information, invoices, orders and quotes do not appear  in the search result.
