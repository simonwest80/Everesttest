# Priority


You can set priorities for your sales opportunities. You can select  the sales documents that have an opportunity with a set priority, in this  tab.


{:.note}
If you create sales documents directly, a priority is not assigned,  by default, to the sales opportunity. Unless you input the priority, invoices,  orders and quotes do not appear in the search result.
