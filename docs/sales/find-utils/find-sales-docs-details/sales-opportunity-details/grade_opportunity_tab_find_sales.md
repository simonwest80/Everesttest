# Grade


You can specify the sales grade to search for invoicing documents.


{:.note}
If you create sales documents directly (without a sales  opportunity), a sales grade is not assigned by default to the opportunity.


Unless you input the grade, invoices, orders and quotes  will not appear in the search result.
