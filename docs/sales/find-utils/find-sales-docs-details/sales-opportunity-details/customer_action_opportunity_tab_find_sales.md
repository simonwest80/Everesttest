# Customer Action Choice


This field allows you to search for documents based on the customer's  action towards the opportunity associated with the document.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the customer action choice associated with an opportunity is **Demonstration 
 for Add-on Products**, you can use this in the search parameter.

If you create sales documents directly, a customer action  choice is not assigned to the sales opportunity.


Unless you input this information, invoices, orders  and quotes do not appear in the search result.
