# Find Documents


The **Find** feature for invoicing  documents facilitates your search for sales documents based on specific  search parameters.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  your customer insists that there has been a duplication of invoice, you  can search all the invoices against that customer to verify facts.


The search for documents yields the document browser with all the fields.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  want to use the filter option to generate a list of the top customers  for the day, week, month, or year for your sales representatives. To do  this, create a **Find Document Filter**  for each sales person in the following manner:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing** >  **Find Documents**. You will see the  **Find Sales Documents** dialog box.
- Select the  sales representatives' names in the **Sales 
 Representative** field.
- Select **Sales Invoices** and **Credit 
 Memos** in the **Document Type**  field.
- In the **Document Date** field, select **This 
 Month**, **Today** or **This 
 Week** as required.
- Enter an appropriate  name for the filter in the **Filter Name**  field. You can save the filter for later use, instead of re-creating it.
- Select **All** in the **Number 
 of Records to Retrieve** field.
- Click **Find** to run the filter. You will see  the **Sales Documents** browser listing  the filtered records.



In the respective sales documents browser, you can further filter the  records by using the **My Documents**  or **All Documents** option from the  **View** menu.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You may  specify This Year in the **Document Date**  field. If you use that selection in conjunction with the **My 
 Documents** option, **Everest**  culls out only those documents that are assigned to you during the current  year.


If you want to search  for documents based on a specific amount


(**Amounts**  tab > **Amount**) for a specific  year (**Quick Find** > **Document 
 Date**), and combine it with the **All 
 Documents** option, all the documents that satisfy the amount condition  for that year are filtered.
