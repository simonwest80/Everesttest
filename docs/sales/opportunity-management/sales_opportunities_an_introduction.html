<p>Prospective customers and the value of sales expected are tracked in  <strong>Everest</strong> using the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunity</strong> feature. Creating sales opportunities (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong> &gt; <strong>Sales</strong><strong>Opportunities</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>  &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong>) helps you track the stage in which each opportunity  is, its probable value and expected date of closure.</p>

<p>Effective sales management requires that the leads that are converted  into opportunities are evaluated and tracked.</p>

<p>Tracking sales opportunities helps you do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Estimate the  cash value of future inflows.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the  cash benefits and effectiveness of different sales and marketing channels  such as the Web, newspapers and magazines.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the  effectiveness of sales personnel.</li>
  <li>Manage customer  contacts.</li>
  <li>Analyze the  percentage of opportunities converted to orders, deals lost and the reasons  thereof.</li>
</ul>
