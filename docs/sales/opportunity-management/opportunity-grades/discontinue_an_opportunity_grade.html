<p>When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue an opportunity grade, do the  following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup</strong> <strong>&gt; Grade</strong>. You will see the <strong>Opportunity</strong><strong>Grade</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Opportunity</strong> <strong>Grade</strong>  browser, highlight the opportunity grade that has to be discontinued.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Discontinue</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The record that was selected is  no longer visible in the <strong>Opportunity</strong><strong>Grade</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>
