# Discontinue a Sales Stage


When you discontinue a record, it becomes temporarily unavailable for  selection. The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a sales stage, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup** **&gt; 
 Sales Stage**. You will see the **Sales 
 Stage Tracking Setup** browser.
- From the **Sales Stage Tracking Setup** browser,  highlight the sales stage record that has to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  You will see the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK**. The record that was selected is  no longer visible in the **Sales Stage 
 Tracking Setup** browser.
