<p>The <strong>Custom Fields</strong> tab allows  you to define additional information for any record as per your requirement.  Custom fields can be defined as character strings, or date, logical, memo  or numeric fields. This <em>**</em> tab is  displayed only when you save the profile.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  the opportunity requires any special handling, for instance the customer  is in a different location and the product has to be packed to cater to  transport hazards. You can create a ‘character’ type custom field, called  ‘Special packing for long distance customers’.</p>

<p>You can create a ‘character’ type custom  field to track the contract type in the case of service opportunities  such as yearly, monthly or quarterly.</p>
