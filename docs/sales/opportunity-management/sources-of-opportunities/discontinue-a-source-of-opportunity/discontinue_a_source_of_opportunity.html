<p>When you discontinue a record it becomes temporarily unavailable for  selection. The record is not deleted from the database, it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.</p>

<p class="steps">To discontinue a source of opportunity, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt;</strong> <strong>Source</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Source of Opportunity</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Source of Opportunity</strong> browser, highlight  the source of opportunity that has to be discontinued.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Discontinue</strong>. You will see  the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The record that was selected is  no longer visible in the <strong>Source of Opportunity</strong>  browser.</li>
