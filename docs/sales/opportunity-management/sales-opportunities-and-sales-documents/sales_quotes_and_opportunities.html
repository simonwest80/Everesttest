<p>A sales opportunity is similar to a sales quote - both indicate probable  sales.</p>

<p>Differences between a Sales Quote and a Sales Opportunity</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sales Quote</td>
      <td>Sales Opportunity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>It generally contains item details.</td>
      <td>It specifies the probable value of sale.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>It is created only when the customer asks for price  quotations.</td>
      <td>It is created at the initial stages of the sales process  with the customer, such as the initial customer call.</td>
    </tr>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> treats sales opportunities  on par with sales quotes. When an opportunity is converted to a quote,  you can view and edit information pertaining to opportunities from the  <strong>Sales Quote</strong> profile.</p>

<p>You can therefore do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a sales  opportunity as just an opportunity.</li>
  <li>Create a sales  quote and enter additional information in the <strong>Sales 
 Opportunity</strong> profile such as its stage, grade or close dates.</li>
  <li>Convert a sales  opportunity to a sales quote.</li>
</ul>
