# Sales Quotes and Opportunities


A sales opportunity is similar to a sales quote - both indicate probable  sales.


Differences between a Sales Quote and a Sales Opportunity


| Sales Quote | Sales Opportunity |
| It generally contains item details. | It specifies the probable value of sale. |
| It is created only when the customer asks for price  quotations. | It is created at the initial stages of the sales process  with the customer, such as the initial customer call. |

- Create a sales  opportunity as just an opportunity.

 Opportunity** profile such as its stage, grade or close dates.
