# Sales Opportunity Details from Sales Document Profiles


You can enter sales opportunity details such as source, grade, stage  and reasons for closure directly in a sales quote, order and invoice without  creating a sales opportunity first. Select **Options 
 &gt; Edit Opportunity** from the document profile to view the **Sales Opportunity** profile.


Maintaining sales opportunity details for sales quotes, orders or invoices  that are created directly is important for the following reasons:

- You can track  the stage in which the sales quote is.
- You can measure  the effectiveness of the various means of advertisement by keeping track  of the source of the sale.
- You can track  the reasons for clinching the order.
