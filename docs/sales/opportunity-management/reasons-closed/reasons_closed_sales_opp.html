<p>Keeping track of the reason due to which an opportunity is closed enables  you to track the reasons for success or failure in converting potential  sales. You can define:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reason-closed-group/create_a_reason_closed_group_profile.html">Reason  Closed Groups</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reason-closed-selection/create_a_reason_closed_selection_profile.html">Reason  Closed Choice</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">A sales opportunity may be closed because the customer  finds the product too expensive. You can then create a reason closed group  called ‘Financial’ and the corresponding selection for the group can be  called ‘Beyond customer’s current budget’.</p>
