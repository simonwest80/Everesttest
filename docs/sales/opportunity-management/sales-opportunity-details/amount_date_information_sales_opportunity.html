<dl>
  <dt><strong>Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>The value of the sales opportunity:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Is the gross  sales value that is expected from the sale.</li>
  <li>Is not the  margin or profit expected on the sale.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Must be entered  in the base currency. If the customer’s currency differs from the base  currency:</p>
  </li>
  <li>The value is  automatically computed when you enter the sales value in foreign currency  in the <strong>Forex 
 value</strong> field of the <strong>Documents</strong> tab  in this profile.</li>
  <li>When you enter  the value in base currency in this field, the <strong>Forex 
 value</strong> field is automatically updated with the value on foreign  currency.</li>
</ul>

<p>: Where the sales quote, order or invoice is directly  created, this field displays the value in base currency for that document.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Probability</strong></dt>
  <dd>The probability that an opportunity in this stage  would be converted to a sale is entered as a percentage in this field.  Entering this data helps in statistical estimation of future cash inflows.</dd>
  <dd>This is a numeric field. By default, this field  displays the probability percentage for the selected stage as entered  in the <strong>Sales Stage</strong> profile (path:  <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Sales Stage &gt;</strong> <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong>). You can change  the probability percentage if required.</dd>
  <dd>If you change the stage of the sales opportunity,  <strong>Everest</strong> asks you to confirm whether  the probability must be replaced with the probability defined for the  new stage.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Probable Value</strong></dt>
  <dd>The probable value is calculated by multiplying  the probability of converting the opportunity to a sale with the value.</dd>
  <dd>Probable Value = Probability x Value</dd>
  <dd><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If the estimated value of the sales opportunity is $10000  and the probability is 50% at stage 4, the probable value will be 10000*50%  = $5000.</dd>
  <dd>The probable value  helps to estimate the value of probable sales.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Estimated Close Date</strong></dt>
  <dd>This date helps to evaluate the value of your sales  and future cash inflows.</dd>
