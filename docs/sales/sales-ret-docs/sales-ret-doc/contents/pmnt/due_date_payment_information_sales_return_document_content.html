<p>If you select the <strong>Override</strong> box,  you can enter a due date in this <em>**</em> field.  If this box is not checked, then the due date for payment of a document  is computed based on the payment term selected for the sales return document.  The due date is calculated from the date of the memo. The due date cannot  be earlier than the document date.</p>

<p>Once the <strong>Override</strong> check box  is selected, the <strong>Terms</strong> field is  disabled.</p>

<p class="note">The <strong>Override</strong>  check box is not relevant for a credit quote or a credit order as the  items have not been returned and refunds are not due (due dates are relevant  only when payments are due).</p>
