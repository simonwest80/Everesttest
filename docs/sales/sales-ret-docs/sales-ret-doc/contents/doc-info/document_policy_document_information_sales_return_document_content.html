<p>Document policies are custom messages/notes/information/conditions attached  to the system documents (and their alias) that print along with the document  (usually printed at the bottom of the document).</p>

<p>The policy that is applicable to the document is displayed in the document  policy section of the status bar. This policy can be edited from the sales  return documents.</p>

<p>The document policy applicable to a document is determined using the  following rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If the customer has  a specific document policy for that document type, then the document policy  for the customer is selected.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If  a document policy for credit quotes is associated in the <strong>Customer</strong>’s  profile, that policy is displayed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>If the customer does  not have a policy associated with that document type, then the policy  associated with the document alias is displayed.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If both the customer  and the document alias do not have a policy associated, then the company’s  default policy for that document type is used (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Documents &gt; Purchase 
 Policy</strong> tab<strong>/Sales Policy</strong> tab).**</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When a credit quote is converted to a credit order, or when a credit  order is converted to a credit memo, the document policy applicable to  the order or memo is determined and applied to the converted document.</p>
