<p>The date displayed in a sales return document is the date of creation  of the document. If a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted  to a memo, the date displayed on the order or the memo will be the login  date on which the document was converted.</p>

<p>In a credit memo document, the document date determines the accounting  period in which the accounting entries for sales return must be created.</p>

<p>You cannot change the date on the document once it has been saved.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/note.gif" alt="" /> The document date displayed  by default is the login  date. To create documents with different dates, you must login  with a different date.</p>

<p>The document date is used to compute the due date for the document,  if the payment terms are <strong>On Account</strong> for  the payment term of type <strong>Specified days 
 from invoice</strong>. (The transaction is a credit transaction and settlement  is required in the due date only).</p>
