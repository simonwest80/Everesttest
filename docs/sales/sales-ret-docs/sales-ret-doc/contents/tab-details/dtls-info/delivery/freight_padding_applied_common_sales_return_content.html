<p>You may want to charge your customer an additional amount/percentage  over the actual freight charges. This amount is treated as a profit while  shipping goods. This amount is not shown separately and is included in  the freight charge. This is called freight padding.</p>

<p>The <strong>Freight Padding Applied</strong>  option indicates whether you want to include the freight padding amount  as part of the freight expenses while shipping goods to the customer.  If you have specified the freight padding amount/percentage in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/delivery_method_profile_rate_tab.html"><strong>Carrier</strong> profile</a> or in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/business-processes-in-everest/other-defaults/the_other_defaults_dialog_box.html"><strong>Other Defaults</strong> dialog box</a>, this  checkbox is selected by default. You can select or deselect  this option as required.</p>
