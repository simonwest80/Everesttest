<p>The <strong>FOB</strong> (Free on Board) field  identifies the physical location where the title in the items passes to  the buyers and the party is responsible for payment of freight.</p>

<p>The commonly used terms to indicate passage of the title and payables  are:</p>

<p><strong>FOB</strong> <strong>Origin</strong>  - Indicates that the buyer assumes title to the goods the moment the carrier  signs the bill of lading. The buyer is responsible for paying shipment  charges.</p>

<p><strong>FOB</strong> <strong>Destination</strong>  - Indicates that the seller retains title of the goods until the goods  are delivered to the buyer. The seller is responsible for payment of freight.</p>

<p>Some of the common variations of FOB are listed below:</p>
