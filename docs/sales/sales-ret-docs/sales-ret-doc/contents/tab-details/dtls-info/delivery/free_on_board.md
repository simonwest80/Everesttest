# Free On Board


The **FOB** (Free on Board) field  identifies the physical location where the title in the items passes to  the buyers and the party is responsible for payment of freight.


The commonly used terms to indicate passage of the title and payables  are:


**FOB** **Origin**  - Indicates that the buyer assumes title to the goods the moment the carrier  signs the bill of lading. The buyer is responsible for paying shipment  charges.

| FOB Origin Freight Prepaid | Seller pays and bears the freight charges. |
| FOB Origin Freight Prepaid and Add | Seller pays and then invoices the buyer for freight  charges. |
