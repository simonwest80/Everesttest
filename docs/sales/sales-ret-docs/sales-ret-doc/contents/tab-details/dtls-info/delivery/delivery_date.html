<h1 id="delivery-date">Delivery Date</h1>

<p>The <strong>Delivery</strong> <strong>Date</strong>  field in a credit quote or a credit order allows you to specify the date  of expected delivery of the shipment from the customer. When a new document  is created, by default the <strong>Delivery Date</strong>  field displays the current system date. This field helps plan management  of inventories or schedule repair jobs.</p>

<p>The delivery date on a credit memo identifies the date on which the  items were actually returned, as there could be a time lag between the  date on which the items were returned and the date on which the credit  memo was created.</p>

<p>When a new credit quote, credit order or credit memo document is created,  the <strong>Delivery Date</strong> field defaults  to the login  date. When you convert a credit quote to a credit order or a credit order  to a credit memo, the following will occur:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The converted  credit order displays the login  date, if the delivery date on the credit quote is blank.</li>
  <li>The converted  credit order displays the date on the credit quote, if a delivery date  has been specified in the credit quote.</li>
</ul>
