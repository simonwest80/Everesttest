<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field identifies  the location or the sub-location to which the document belongs. When a  new quote, order or memo is created, the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field displays the login  location/sub-location. If required you can assign a different location  or sub-location to the document.</p>

<p>When you assign a location/sub-location  to the document, you can keep track of the credit documents by sub-location  and print reports for management information purposes.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You can generate a report  of all credit quotes raised from the retail department to review the returns  received in that department and inquire into the causes.</p>

<p>When a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to a  memo, the location/sub-location specified in the original quote or order  is displayed in the converted order or memo. You can change the location/sub-location  for a sales return document before you post the journal for the credit  memo.</p>

<p>The document’s location/sub-location detail is required to print the  addresses and logo on the document. Location/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected,  the address and logo of the sub-location’s location is used.</p>

<p class="note">You can set a preference by selecting <strong>Allow 
 user to open only those invoicing documents which belong to his/her default 
 location/sub-location</strong> (path: <strong>File</strong>  &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>  &gt; <strong>Flow Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Documents</strong>  &gt; <strong>Miscellaneous</strong> &gt; <strong>Others &gt; Others 2</strong> tab) to ensure  that users are allowed to open only those documents that belong to the  user’s location/sub-location.</p>
