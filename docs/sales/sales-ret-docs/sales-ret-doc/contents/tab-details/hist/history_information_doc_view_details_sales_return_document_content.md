# Transaction History Information


The **History** tab in a sales return  document displays the entire history of a transaction beginning from the  inception (credit quote), to the payment on the final document. The **Shipment Tracking** tab in a sales invoice  document allows you to enter the tracking number for the shipment. The  tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system using a bar code  scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered with different  delivery methods for each shipment.

This tab is displayed only when you save the sales return  document.


The **History** tab displays the  following information:

- Details of  credit quote creation such as date and time of creation, amount of document  and the user who created the quote.
- Details of  credit order creation, such as date and time of creation, amount of document  and the user who created the order. The profit made on all the items on  the document is displayed if items are committed on the order.
- Details of  credit memo creation such as date and time of creation, amount of document,  user who created the memo, and the profit made on all the items on the  document.
- Details of  payments or deposits received and refunded on the document such as the  payment type and reference number. Details of payments that are applied  to the document are also displayed.
- If payment  is received or refunded through a credit card, the card number, address  verification details, batch processing details and the authorization responses  are also displayed. Credit card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).
- Details of  modifications made to documents such as changes in the customer contact  and shipping addresses, change in the document alias, payment terms, delivery  method, location/sub-location and jurisdiction.
