<p>The <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> column displays  the location or sub-location assigned to the document. You can select  another location or sub-location, if you want to allocate revenues and  expenses for the item to another location or sub-location.</p>

<p><strong>Change a Location/Sub-Location</strong></p>

<p>You can change the location/sub-location by selecting a different one  from the <strong>Loc/Sub-Loc</strong> field. Once  you change the location/sub-location, you will be prompted with a message  asking you whether you wish to change all the line item sub-locations  with the location/sub-location.</p>
