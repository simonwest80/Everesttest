<p>The <strong>Cost</strong> column in the Item  Details Grid displays the cost of the item. This column displays the average  cost or the last cost, depending on the preferences set in the <strong>Default 
 value for the user defined cost column in a document</strong> option of  the <strong>Other</strong> <strong>Flow</strong><strong>Control</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong>  &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Flow</strong><strong>Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Other</strong><strong>Flow</strong> <strong>Control</strong> &gt; <strong>Item</strong> <strong>Cost</strong>/<strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Summary</strong> tab).</p>

<p>If the display cost in the <strong>Other</strong><strong>Flow</strong> <strong>Control</strong>  dialog box is set to <strong>None</strong> then  the cost displayed will be zero.</p>

<p>If the item is factored, the factored last or average cost is displayed.  Factored costs are displayed only if the item’s cost is factored and if  the option <strong>Factor cost (enable cost inflation)</strong>  is selected in the <strong>Other</strong> <strong>Flow Control</strong> dialog box (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow 
 Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary</strong> tab).</p>

<p>For non-inventoried items with cost calculated as a percent of selling  price, cost displayed is displayed as a percent of the return price.</p>

<p>If required, the cost displayed in the sales return document can be  modified.</p>

<p>The cost displayed or entered in this column will be used to calculate  sales commissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If sales commission  is calculated on profits and</li>
  <li>The type of  cost used for commission calculation is user-defined cost (defined in  the <strong>Type of cost used for commission 
 calculation</strong> option of the <strong>Other</strong><strong>Flow Control</strong> dialog box. Path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary</strong>  tab).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, accounting entries for the Cost of Goods sold are generated  for the actual cost (in case of serialized items) or the average cost  (in case of non-serialized or non-inventoried items).</p>

<p class="note">When non-serialized or non-inventoried items are returned,  cost at which the return is accounted is the current average cost and  not the average cost at the time of sale.</p>
