<p>A timer can be invoked in the <strong>Description/Notes</strong>  window to record the number of minutes and seconds for a service type  item.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> In  case of service calls that you record by the hour, you can select an item  that represents the service cost. When you begin to speak to the customer’s  customer service, you can activate the timer and on conclusion of the  call stop the timer and thereby record the total time spent on the call.</strong></p>
