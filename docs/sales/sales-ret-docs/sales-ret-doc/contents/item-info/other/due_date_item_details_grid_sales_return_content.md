# Due Date


The **Due** **Date**  field allows you to enter the delivery date on which you expect to receive  a particular line item from the customer. If this field is left blank,  it means that the line item takes the delivery date specified for the  document in the **Delivery** **Date** field in the sales return document.


You can enter a delivery date for the line item. If you have entered  a delivery date for the line item, and you subsequently change the date  specified in the **Delivery** **Date** field of a sales return document  and save the document, a message will be displayed stating that some line  items have delivery dates that are different from document's delivery  date. The existing delivery dates of these line items will be retained.


{:.note}
This message will be displayed only if the **Due****Date** column for the line item  is populated.
