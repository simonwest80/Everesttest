<p>The tax code of the item returned is determined based on the jurisdiction  for the sales return document. The jurisdiction is based on the return  address and the delivery method. This tax code may differ from the tax  code that was applied at the time of sale.</p>

<p>This is a mandatory field.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If you  want to manually override the taxes, you can change the tax code for the  item.</p>

<p>To ensure that the correct sales tax accounts are correctly debited  for the return, select the tax code that was applied when the item was  sold.</p>
