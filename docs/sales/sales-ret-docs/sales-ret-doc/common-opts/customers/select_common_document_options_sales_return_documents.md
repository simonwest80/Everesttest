# Select


Use the **Select** option (path: **Sales** **Return** **Document** > **Option** > **Customer** > **Select**) to display the **Customers** browser when you create a new document. You can select the customer of your choice from the browser that is displayed. On a quote/order, use this option if you want to change the customer for whom the document is created. You cannot change the customer once a credit memo is saved.
