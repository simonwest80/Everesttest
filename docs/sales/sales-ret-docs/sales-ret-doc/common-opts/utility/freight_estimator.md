# Freight Estimation


**Everest** allows you to compute  freight using the [Everest Freight  Estimator]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/freight-est/everest-freight-estimator/everest_freight_estimator.html) if you select the **Include 
 in Freight Calculation** option in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window** > **Sales**  tab).


{:.note}
Freight may be included in a credit memo even after  it has been created and saved. However, a credit memo whose journal has  been posted cannot be modified.
