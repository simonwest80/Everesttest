# Correcting Errors in Credit Memos


The following types of errors may occur in a credit memo:

- **Customer 
 information** - When attaching items to a credit memo, if the serialized  items are not sold to the customer, you are informed of the same. In the  case of non-serialized and non-inventoried items, if the credit memo is  created for a wrong customer (but the items are correct), you must create  a manual sales journal debiting the wrong customer and also crediting  the correct customer.
- **Return 
 value** - If you enter the return value incorrectly, you must either  debit or credit the customer by creating a manual sales journal for the  difference.
- **Item 
 quantity** - If the item quantity actually returned was less than  what was entered on the credit memo, create an Inventory Adjustment document  to write off the quantity not received. Debit the customer through a manual  sales journal for the difference in value.
- **Allocation 
 to the wrong cost center or location/sub-location**- In case an expense  or income account is allocated to the wrong cost center or location/sub-location,  create a general journal entry debiting and crediting the relevant account  and selecting the cost centers to and from which the amount has to be  re-allocated.
