<p>The amount of the credit memo that can be applied as a deposit on a  sales order or as a payment against a sales invoice is displayed in this  tab.</p>

<p>In a Credit Memo, this tab also shows deposits available on credit orders.  The credit memo can be applied to a sales invoice/sales order or the deposit  on credit order can be applied towards the credit memo.</p>

<p>If you apply one document to another, a transaction is automatically  created in a receipt journal (for the amount applied). The <strong>Payment 
 Type</strong> field in the receipt journal defaults to the payment method  selected in the <strong>Default payment method 
 for applied payments</strong> field of the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/setting-up-a-company/misc/workstation_settings_stock_areas_others.html"><strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box</a><font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000"> </font>(path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; General &gt; 
 Others</strong> tab). If a payment method is not defined in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box, the payment method selected in the <strong>Default 
 payment method for applied payments</strong> field in the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/accounting/accounting-flow-control-and-defaults/accounting-defaults/accounting_miscellaneous.html"><strong>Accounting</strong> dialog box</a> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous</strong> tab) will be used.</p>

<p>The <strong>Apply Deposits/Refunds</strong> tab  consist of two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Documents Available</strong> - All sales invoices where payments are pending  and all credit orders where an advance is paid to the customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Documents Applied</strong> - The documents that are applied to the current  document are displayed in this section.</li>
</ul>

<p class="steps">To apply a document, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the <strong>General</strong> tab of the <strong>Refund</strong> dialog box, enter 0 in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Apply Deposits/Refunds</strong> tab of the <strong>Refund</strong> dialog box, highlight the required  document in the <strong>Advance Documents Available</strong>  section.</li>
  <li>Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/sales_include_button.gif" alt="" /> icon to move the document to the <strong>Advance 
 Documents Applied</strong> section.</li>
  <li>After moving  a document, to the <strong>Advance Documents 
 Applied</strong> section, you can change the amount to be applied in the  <strong>Amount</strong> column.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="note">
