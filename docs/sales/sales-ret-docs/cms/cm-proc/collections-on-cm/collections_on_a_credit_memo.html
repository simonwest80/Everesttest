<p>You may initially refund a customer for items that are returned. Later,  your customer may decide to take another item in exchange for the returned  item. In this case, you would receive either a full or partial collection  on a credit memo from the customer.</p>

<p>Collections from customers on a credit memo can be made by cash, check  or by credit card. A credit card payment is processed when you select  the <strong>Use Payment Processor</strong> option  in the <strong>Credit Card Processing</strong>  tab (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong>  &gt; <strong>In New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Credit Card Processing</strong> tab).</p>

<p class="steps">To receive collection on a credit memo, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Memo</strong> profile, select <strong>Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Collect</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/sales/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/collections/dlg/the_collection_dialog_box.html"><strong>Collection</strong> dialog box</a>.</li>
  <li>Enter the amount  to be collected in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">The <strong>Collect</strong> option  is enabled only when the you have made a refund on the credit memo.</p>
