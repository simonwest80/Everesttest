# Back End Processes - Creating a Credit Memo from an Order


The following back-end processes occur when a credit order is converted  to a credit memo:

- If the 'credited'  quantity is less than the 'requested' quantity, the credit order is assigned  the status of 'Backorder'.

- If the 'requested'  quantity is returned, the credit order is assigned the status 'Closed'.  To view closed credit orders, select **Options 
 &gt; Received Credit Orders** from the **Credit 
 Orders** browser.
- When the 'committed'  quantity is received, the stock status of the item displays the following  changes:


- **Stock 
 Status of the item** â€“ The quantity 'On Credit' for the item reduces  by the quantity received. The total and available quantity of the item  increases.
- **Stock 
 Status in the committed stock area** - If the committed quantity  is returned, the available out, free out and on credit stock of the item  reduces by the quantity returned.
- **Stock 
 Status in the assigned stock area** - The total stock and the free  stock increases by the quantity returned.
