<p><strong>You can convert the quote to a credit order  by using the **Reserve</strong> option. Once  the order has been converted, the credit quote ceases to exist as a system  document and generates a credit order with <strong>Open</strong>  status. The credit quote can no longer be accessed from the <strong>Credit 
 Quotes</strong> browser; however, it appears as a reference number in the  credit order created. The document number for the new credit order is  automatically generated by the system.**</p>

<p class="steps">To convert a credit quote into a credit order,  do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Invoicing &gt; Credit 
 Quote</strong>. You will see the <strong>Credit 
 Quotes</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Quotes</strong> browser, highlight the  quote that has to be converted to a credit order.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Credit Quote</strong> profile.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Credit Quote</strong> profile, select <strong>Process 
 &gt; Reserve</strong>. The credit quote is converted to a credit order.</li>
</ul>
