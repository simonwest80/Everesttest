# Back End Processes - Converting a Credit Quote to a Credit Order


When a credit quote is converted to a credit order, the following back-end  processes occur:

- The credit  quote gets converted to an open credit order. The credit quote is no longer  visible in the **Credit Quotes** browser.
- The sequence  number of the credit order is generated by the system.

- The quantity  'on credit' for each line item increases by the quantity requested in  the credit order.
