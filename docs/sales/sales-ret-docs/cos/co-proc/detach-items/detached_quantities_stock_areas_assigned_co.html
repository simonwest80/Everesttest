<h1 id="detached-quantities---stock-areas-assigned">Detached Quantities - Stock Areas Assigned</h1>

<p>Detached quantities are moved to the default stock area that is specified  in the <strong>Workstation</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>  or the stock transfer preferences specified for the login  location.</p>

<p>Stock areas to which items detached from a credit order are assigned,  are <strong>Out</strong> type of stock areas. This  is because you still do not own the stock returned to you.</p>

<p>The stock area to which detached quantities are assigned is determined  by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a default  stock area for unassigned items on credit orders is specified in the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog box (path:  <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab), the  quantities are assigned to this stock area.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock area is defined in <strong>Workstation</strong><strong>Settings</strong>, the items are assigned  to the stock area defined for unassigned items on credit orders in the  logged in location or sub-location (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; 
 New &gt; Location &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Sales Document</strong> tab). If no stock area is defined for logged in location or sub-location,  the stock area defined for the default location is used.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If no default  stock areas for unassigned items on credit orders are defined in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> or in stock transfer  preferences of the login  location as above, the default stock area defined for <strong>Sales 
 Invoices</strong> in the <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> (path: <strong>File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales</strong> tab)  is used.</li>
  <li>If no default  stock area for unassigned credit orders is defined in the <strong>Workstation 
 Settings</strong> dialog box or the logged in location and no default stock  area for <strong>Sales invoices</strong> is defined  in <strong>Workstation Settings</strong> dialog  box, the items are assigned to the stock area defined for sales invoices  in the logged in location or sub-location (path: <strong>File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong> &gt;  <strong>Stock</strong> <strong>Transfer</strong>  &gt; <strong>Sales</strong> <strong>Document</strong>  tab). If no stock area is defined for the logged in location or sub-location,  the stock area defined for the default location is used.</li>
