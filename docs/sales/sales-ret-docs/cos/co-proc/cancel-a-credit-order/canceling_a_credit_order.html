<h1 id="cancel-a-credit-order">Cancel a Credit Order</h1>

<p><strong>If you do not wish to continue the sales  return process with your customer, you can cancel the credit order using  the **Cancel Order</strong> option from the  <strong>Credit Orders</strong> profile (path: <strong>Credit Order</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Options 
 &gt; Process &gt; Cancel Order</strong>).**</p>

<p><strong>The following credit orders cannot be canceled:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A credit order  that is a backorder.</li>
  <li>A credit order  that has items committed.</li>
  <li>A closed credit  order.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you cancel the credit order, it gets  converted to a credit quote irrespective of whether the credit order was  created directly or by converting a credit quote. The credit quote becomes  available again as a system document.</strong></p>
