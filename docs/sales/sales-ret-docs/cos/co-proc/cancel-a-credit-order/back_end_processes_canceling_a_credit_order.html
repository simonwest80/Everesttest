<p><strong>The following back-end processes occur  when a credit order is canceled:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The credit  order is converted to a credit quote.</li>
  <li>If the canceled  credit order was converted from a quote, it gets converted to a credit  quote with the same number as the original quote.</li>
  <li>If the canceled  credit order was created directly, it gets converted to a credit quote  with the next number assigned to it in the sequence of credit quotes.</li>
  <li>The sequence  number of the canceled credit order is not available for further use in  other credit orders.</li>
  <li>The quantity  ‘on credit’ for the item reduces in the item stock status.</li>
</ul>
