<h1 id="the-collection-dialog-box---prior-payments">The Collection Dialog Box - Prior Payments</h1>

<p>This tab is displayed when you collect payment from a foreign currency  customer on a credit order. If you refund advance payments to the customer  (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you  to indicate the amount that must be received as a collection.</p>

<p>This tab comprises two sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Documents Available</strong> - This panel displays all available advance  payments made (i.e., advance payments not applied on a credit memo) on  the current credit order.</li>
  <li><strong>Advance 
 Documents Applied</strong> - All advances that you apply to the current  document are displayed in this panel. Use the &gt; and » buttons  to move the available payments to this column. You can change the amount  being applied by editing the <strong>Amount</strong>  column.</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the <strong>Amount</strong>  field (path: <strong>Collection</strong> dialog  box &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab).</p>

<p>When you collect a deposit, a transaction is automatically created in  a receipt journal.</p>
