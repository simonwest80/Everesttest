# The Collection Dialog Box - Prior Payments


This tab is displayed when you collect payment from a foreign currency  customer on a credit order. If you refund advance payments to the customer  (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you  to indicate the amount that must be received as a collection.


This tab comprises two sections:

- **Advance 
 Documents Available** - This panel displays all available advance  payments made (i.e., advance payments not applied on a credit memo) on  the current credit order.
- **Advance 
 Documents Applied** - All advances that you apply to the current  document are displayed in this panel. Use the > and >> buttons  to move the available payments to this column. You can change the amount  being applied by editing the **Amount**  column.



The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the **Amount**  field (path: **Collection** dialog  box > **General** tab).


When you collect a deposit, a transaction is automatically created in  a receipt journal.
