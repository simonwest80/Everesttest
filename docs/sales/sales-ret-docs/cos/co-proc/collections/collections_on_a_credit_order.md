# Collections on a Credit Order


You may initially refund a customer for items that are returned. Later,  your customer may decide to take another item in exchange for the returned  item. In this case, you would receive either a full or partial collection  on a credit order/memo from the customer.


Collections from customers on a credit order/memo can be made by cash,  check or credit card. A credit card payment is processed when you select  the **Use Payment Processor** option  in the **Credit Card Processing**  tab (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Credit Card Processing** tab).


{:.steps}
To receive collection using a credit card,  do the following:

- From the **Credit Order/Credit Memo** profile, select  **Options &gt; Payment &gt; Collect**.  You will see the [**Collection**  dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/collections/dlg/the_collection_dialog_box.html).
- Select the  appropriate credit card payment method in the **Payment 
 Method** field.
- Enter the amount  to be collected in the **Amount**  field.
- Click **OK**. You will see the [**Card Verification** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/cc-pmts/cc-verify-dlg/the_card_verification_dialog_box.html).



{:.note}
The **Collect** option  is enabled only when you have made the refund on the credit order/memo.
