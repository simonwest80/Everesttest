<h1 id="processing-a-credit-memo">Processing a Credit Memo</h1>

<p><strong>A credit order can be processed to a credit  memo by using the **Process &gt; Memo</strong>  option. When you select this option, the details of the order are copied  to a <strong>Credit Memo</strong> profile. When  the credit memo is saved, the <strong>Credited</strong> column of the credit order is updated with the quantity returned.  When you convert the credit order to a credit memo, the quantity in the  ‘committed’ column appears in the ‘credited’ column by default.**</p>

<p><strong>Every time a shipment is received against  a credit order, a credit memo can be created.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Partial Returns of Inventoried Items</strong></p>

<p><strong>If items against a credit order are returned  in various stages, multiple credit memos can be created for the same credit  order.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/sales/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If five computers are expected  to be returned, but only three are returned, a credit memo can be created  for the three items returned initially. Later when the rest of the computers  are returned, another credit memo can be created.</p>

<p><strong>When partial returns are made against a  credit order, the credit order gets converted to a backorder. The status  of the credit order changes to **Backorder</strong> on the document and in the <strong>Credit 
 Orders</strong> browser. This status remains until the remaining items are  received. When all the items are received, the credit order status becomes  <strong>Closed</strong>.**</p>
