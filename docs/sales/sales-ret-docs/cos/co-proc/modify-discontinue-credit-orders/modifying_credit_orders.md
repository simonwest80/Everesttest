# Modify a Credit Order


The **Credit 
 Order** profile can be modified from any one of the following locations:

- The **Credit 
 Orders** browser - Highlight the record and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.
- The **Credit 
 Orders** profile - Specify the document number of the required order  in the **Document #** field.



You can modify all information (including Customer information) except  the document number and expiry date. If refunds or collections are made  on the credit order, you cannot select another customer because a payment  history exists for that document.
