# Generate Serial Numbers


You can generate serial numbers (path: **Credit 
 Order** profile > **Options** > **Attach/Retrieve Serial #** > **Generate Serial #**) for items that you  want to bring into your stock from credit orders and credit memos. The  serial numbers generated are attached to the credit order/memo. You can  also generate serial numbers for negative quantities in sales invoices.


This feature has the following uses:

- If you have received returns from customers for  items that were sold before you migrated to **Everest**,  you can use the **Generate Serial #**  option to track these items.
- You can use this option  to account for services provided or to keep track of the return of serialized  items that you have not sold. You can then assign the manufacturer's serial  numbers, if any, and bring the items back into stock.



![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You are an authorized  service center of a computer vendor. Customers come into your center to  service items that they have bought in any other store or to return defectives.  You then return this item to the computer vendor. In such a case, generating  new serial numbers helps you keep track of such items.


If you select this option from the **Credit 
 Order** profile, the serial numbers are transferred to an 'Out' type  of stock area.

If you select this option from the **Credit 
 Memo** profile, the serial numbers are transferred to a 'Stock' type  of stock area.
