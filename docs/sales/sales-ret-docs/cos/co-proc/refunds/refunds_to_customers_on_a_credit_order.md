# Refunds to Customers on a Credit Order


Refunds to customers from a credit order can be made by cash, check,  or a credit card. A credit card payment is processed only when you select  the **Use Payment Processor** option  in the **Credit Card Processing**  tab (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options** > **New**  > **In New Window** > **Credit Card Processing** tab).


{:.steps}
To make refunds on a credit order, do the  following:

- From the **Credit Order** profile, select **Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Refund**. You will see the [**Refund** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/refunds/dlg/refund_dialog_box_general_co.html).
- Select the  appropriate credit card payment method in the **Payment 
 Method** field.
- Enter the amount  to be refunded in the **Amount** field.
- Click **OK**. You will see the [**Card Verification** dialog box.]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/refunds-on-so/cc-refund/the_card_verification_dialog_box_refund.html) ****



{:.note}
The **Refund** option  is enabled only when the total amount on the credit order is NOT refunded  to the customer. On a new credit order, the option is available when the  credit order is saved.
