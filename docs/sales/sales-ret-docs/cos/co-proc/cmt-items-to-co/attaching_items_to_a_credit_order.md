# Attach Items to a Credit Order


You may commit inventoried items to a credit order in the following  cases:

- When you identify  the items expected back from the customer and assign them to a separate  area.
- When you physically  receive the items but the customer continues to retain ownership of the  items.



You cannot commit items on orders belonging to discontinued customers.


**The **Committed**  column in the **Credit Order** profile  displays the quantity of the committed item. These Â items  are recorded in an **Out** type of  stock area.**

**The quantity 'committed' on a credit order  cannot exceed the quantity 'requested'. However, if the 'committed' quantity  exceeds the 'requested' quantity, **Everest**  informs you of the same. You are prompted to confirm that you want to  proceed. If you choose to continue, the 'requested' quantity gets updated  to equal the 'committed' quantity. This is applicable to all items: serialized,  non-serialized and auto-serialized.**
