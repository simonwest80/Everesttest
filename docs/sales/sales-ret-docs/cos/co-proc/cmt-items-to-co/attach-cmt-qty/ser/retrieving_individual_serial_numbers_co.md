# Retrieving Individual Serial Numbers


Serialized inventory contained only in an 'out' type of stock areas  can be attached to a credit order/memo.


{:.steps}
To retrieve individual serial numbers into  a credit order/memo, do the following:

- From the **Credit Order/Credit Memo** profile, select  **Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve Serial # 
 &gt; Serial #**. You will see the **Retrieve Serial Numbers**  dialog box.
- Specify the  serial number of the item in the **Serial 
 #** field and click **Apply**.



The serial number is attached to the line item. You will be prompted  with a message that the item does not exist on the document when you attach  a serial number of an item that is not present on the sales order or invoice.  Click **Yes** to attach the item to  the document.


{:.note}
This prompt is received only if the **Prompt 
 when trying to retrieve and serialize an item that is not already present 
 on a document** option (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Others &gt; Others 2** tab) is selected.


**Everest** allows you to select  serial numbers from stock areas for the logged in location only, if you  select the **Allow Users to access only 
 those stock areas in the logged in location** check box (path: **File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow 
 Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General** tab).


The serial numbers can also be scanned into the system using your bar  code scanner.
