# Retrieving a Range of Serial Numbers


Serialized inventory contained only in an 'out' type of stock area can  be attached to a credit order/memo.


{:.steps}
To retrieve a range of serial numbers into  a credit order/memo, do the following:

- From the **Credit Order/Credit Memo** profile, select  **Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve Serial # 
 &gt; Serial # Range**. You will see the **Retrieve 
 Serial Numbers** dialog box.
- Specify the  starting and ending serial numbers to be attached to the credit order/credit  memo Â in  the **Serial # From** and **Serial 
 # To** fields and click **Apply**.



The serial numbers are attached to the line item. You are prompted with  a message that the item does not exist on the document when you attach  a serial number of an item that is not present on the credit order or  memo. Click **Yes** to attach the  item to the document.


{:.note}
This prompt is received if the **Prompt 
 when trying to retrieve and serialize an item that is not already present 
 on a document** option (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Others &gt; Others 2** tab) is selected.


You can select serial numbers from stock areas for the logged in location  if you select the **Allow Users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in location** check box (path:  **File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General** tab).


The serial numbers can also be scanned into the system using your bar  code scanner.


Select the [**History**]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/cmt-items-to-co/attach-cmt-qty/ser/retrieving_individual_serial_numbers_co.html#history_retrieve_attach_serial_nos_sales_return) ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_history_button.gif) button to  view details of the serial numbers attached to the item. These details  are displayed in the lower half of the **Retrieve 
 Serial Numbers** dialog box.


{:.note}
Once you select **Close**,  the **Retrieve Serial Numbers** dialog  box closes and you cannot access this information again.
