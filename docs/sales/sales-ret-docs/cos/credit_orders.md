# Credit Orders


A credit order (path: **Invoicing**  > **Credit** **Orders**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window**) is the second  step in the sales return cycle and follows the initial complaint made  by a customer. A credit order is created after you agree to accept the  returns and issue a Return Merchandize  Authorization (RMA).


Creating a credit order has the following uses:

- It serves as  an authorization to receive returned items and credit the customer.
- It maintains  the history of credit orders and follows up on returns.
- It accepts  returned items from customers for exchange or repair.
- It refunds  customers.
- It manages  tasks through the contact manager feature.
