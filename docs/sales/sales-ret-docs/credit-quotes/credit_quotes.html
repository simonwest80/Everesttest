<p>The credit quote (path: <strong>Invoicing</strong>  &gt; <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Quotes</strong><strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window</strong>) is the first document in the sales  return process. It is created when the customer requests a ‘Return Merchandise  Authorization’  for defective or unsatisfactory items. The tentative quantity of the items  proposed to be returned or the value of services for which the customer  wants a reduction is entered in a credit quote.</p>

<p>Although it is not mandatory to create a credit quote before placing  a credit order, it is preferable for returns that have an associated Return  Merchandize  Authorization from the customer. You can keep track of the customer’s  RMAs through the credit quotes.</p>

<p class="note">A credit quote is an intermediate or pending document  in <strong>Everest</strong> and no accounting entries  are generated at this stage.</p>
