# Back End Processes - Creating a Credit Quote


When a credit quote is created, the following back-end processes occur:

- The sequence  number defined in the logged in location or sub-location is assigned to  the credit quote.
- If a sequence  number is not defined for the location, the sequence number for the default  location is used.
