# Credit Quotes


The credit quote (path: **Invoicing**  > **Credit** **Quotes****&gt;** **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**) is the first document in the sales  return process. It is created when the customer requests a 'Return Merchandise  Authorization'  for defective or unsatisfactory items. The tentative quantity of the items  proposed to be returned or the value of services for which the customer  wants a reduction is entered in a credit quote.


Although it is not mandatory to create a credit quote before placing  a credit order, it is preferable for returns that have an associated Return  Merchandize  Authorization from the customer. You can keep track of the customer's  RMAs through the credit quotes.


{:.note}
A credit quote is an intermediate or pending document  in **Everest** and no accounting entries  are generated at this stage.
