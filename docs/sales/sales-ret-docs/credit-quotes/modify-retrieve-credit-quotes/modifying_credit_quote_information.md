# Modify a Credit Quote


**Once you save the quote, all information  can be modified till it gets converted to an order.**


**The **Credit 
 Quote** profile can be modified from any one of the following locations:**

- The **Credit 
 Quotes** browser - Highlight the record and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In Current Window/Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.
- The **Credit 
 Quote** profile - Specify the document number of the required quote  in the **Document #** field.



**After the credit quote is converted to  a credit order, it ceases to exist as a credit quote in the system and  cannot be retrieved or printed.**
