# Convert to Credit Order


**You can convert the quote to a credit order  by using the **Reserve** option (path:  Sales Return Document > **Options &gt; 
 Process**).**


**When this option is selected, all details  of the quote are displayed in the new **Credit 
 Order** profile. By default, the **Requested**  column displays the quantity quoted. You may make any changes required  to the requested quantity and to any other information (including customer  information). The document number for the new credit order is automatically  generated by the system.**


**A credit quote that has been converted  to a credit order can no longer be accessed through the **Credit 
 Quotes** browser. However, it appears as a reference number in the  **Document Status** section of the  **Credit Order** profile.**
