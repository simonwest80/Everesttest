# Customer Level


Customer levels are categories to which customers are assigned, to entitle  them to special prices or discounts. **Everest**  allows you to create any number of customer levels.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  may define level 1 as most valued (and thus qualifying for maximum discounts)  and level 9 as the least valued.


You must then set up item selling prices and discounts for each level.


You can set the default customer level for new customers in the **Customer Level** field of the **Customers**  tab (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Accounting** > **Location/Sub-Location**  > **Customers**). When you create  a new customer, the default customer level specified will be displayed.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  You  can modify the customer level for specific customers anytime from the  **Customer** profile, if you want  to override the defaults.
