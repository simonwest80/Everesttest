<p>Your <strong>Everest</strong> online store uses the same database as all your other operations. Customers can modify address information by logging into your online store. Since any modifications made by the customer will update your database, you can restrict the customer’s access to such modifications. To prevent online frauds and unauthorized use of a customer’s account where items are billed to a customer but shipped elsewhere, you can restrict shipments only to the customer’s billing address.</p>
