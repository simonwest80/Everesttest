# Shipping Address


The customer's shipping addresses are the various addresses to which  you ship the customer's orders. You can define:

- Multiple shipping  addresses for the customer.
- A default shipping  address, to which you normally ship the customer's orders
- A different  shipping address when creating a sales document for the customer.
- The billing  address as the shipping address.



Sales taxes and freight are calculated based on the customer's shipping  address.
