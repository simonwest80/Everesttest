# Billing Address


The address to which the customer's invoice is sent is the billing address  of the customer. The billing address is specified in the **Customer** profile **- General** tab.


{:.note}
**If the customer’s billing address is used  when creating final documents (such as sales invoices or credit memos),  you can modify the billing address by using the ‘**Modify 
 Address**’  option in the **Customer** profile.**


**When you modify a customer’s billing address,  **Everest** allows you to:**

- Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the customer.
- Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.


A customer can have only one billing address but may have any number  of shipping and contact addresses. The customer can log into your **Everest** online store using the customer  code, or the e-mail ID specified in the billing or contact address.
