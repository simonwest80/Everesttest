# Document Policy


Document policies are the company's policies applicable to sales made  to a particular customer or sales returns from a customer.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  The  company's policy for sales orders may be ‘Prices on sales orders are valid  or a period of two weeks from the date of the order’.  But for customer ABC Inc.,  the policy could be that ‘The prices are valid for four weeks’.


This tab allows you to specify a different policy for each sales document  type. This is the default policy applicable for the relevant sales document  for the customer. You can edit the policy or attach a different policy  for individual documents.
