# Salesperson


The salesperson is the user who is responsible for sales to a particular  customer and to whom sales commission accrues. When you create a customer,  this field displays the name of the logged in user, by default.


The salesperson assigned to a customer will be automatically used in  sales documents if you select the **Customerâ€™s 
 Sales Person** option in the **Sales 
 person selected automatically at the time of creating a new invoicing 
 document** field (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Documents** > **Prompts**  tab **&gt; Sales Document** tab).


You can select a different salesperson for individual documents, if  you have adequate security rights.
