# Allow Back Order Creation


This option allows you to indicate if partial shipments are allowed  on sales orders. If you select this check box, the **Allow 
 Back Order** check box on the **Sales 
 Order** profile is selected, by default. You can change this option  at the document level.


If you do not select the **Allow Back 
 Order Creation** check box, the entire order has to be converted  to an invoice. If you try to make a partial shipment, the sales invoice  is NOT saved. **Everest** prompts  you that partial shipment of items is not allowed.


This option is applicable only when you convert a sales order into a  sales invoice.
