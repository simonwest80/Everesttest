<p>This option allows you to indicate if partial shipments are allowed  on sales orders. If you select this check box, the <strong>Allow 
 Back Order</strong> check box on the <strong>Sales 
 Order</strong> profile is selected, by default. You can change this option  at the document level.</p>

<p>If you do not select the <strong>Allow Back 
 Order Creation</strong> check box, the entire order has to be converted  to an invoice. If you try to make a partial shipment, the sales invoice  is NOT saved. <strong>Everest</strong> prompts  you that partial shipment of items is not allowed.</p>

<p>This option is applicable only when you convert a sales order into a  sales invoice.</p>
