# Delivery Method


This field denotes the preferred delivery method for shipments to the  customer. When you create a Â customer,  this field defaults to the delivery method specified in the **Customers** dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Customers**).


You can modify the delivery method for specific customers from the **Customer** profile, if you want to override  the defaults.


When you create a sales document, this delivery method is displayed,  by default, in the **Ship Via** field.  You can select a different delivery method for individual sales documents.  Shipment charges for sales are calculated based on the selected delivery  method.
