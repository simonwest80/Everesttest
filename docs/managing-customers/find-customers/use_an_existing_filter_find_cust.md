# Use an Existing Filter


{:.steps}
To select a filter (for customers) that is  already created, do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Invoicing** > **Find Customers**. You will see the [**Find 
 Customers** dialog box]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/find-customers/find-customers-dialog-box/customer_filter_dialog_box.html).
- From the **Find Customers** dialog box, click the  drop-down button beside the **Filter Name**  field to view a list of recently used filters.
- Select the  required filter and click **OK**.  The relevant tabs in the **Find Customers** dialog box are automatically populated with the parameters specified  for that filter.
- Alternatively,  click the drop-down button beside the field, and select **Browser**  from the right-click menu to display the **Select 
 Filter** browser. This browser displays the list of filters and the  filter IDs  created in **Everest**. You can select  only one filter at a time from this browser. You cannot modify or discontinue  filters from the browser.
- Click the **Find** button to view the list of customers  who match the search criteria.

You can define as many filters as necessary using the **Find 
 Customers** function. The parameters can be selected individually  or in combination with other parameters.
