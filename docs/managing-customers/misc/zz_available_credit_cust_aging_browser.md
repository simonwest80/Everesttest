The available credit for the customer is calculated by deducting the  net outstanding from the customer’s credit limit. Both posted and unposted  amounts are considered for calculating available credit.


**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  A  sales invoice’s outstanding amount is reduced from the available credit  limit even if the document has not been posted.**
