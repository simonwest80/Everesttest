# Credit Cards Browser


The **Credit Cards** browser displays  a list of credit cards set up for the selected customer. The credit card  number is displayed in an encrypted format. Credit card numbers are masked  using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).


This browser has options that are common to all browsers in **Everest**.
