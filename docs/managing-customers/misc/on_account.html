<p>On account purchases <strong>** refer to  credit sales where the customer is allowed a credit period for making  the payments. When you select the **Allow 
 On Account Purchases</strong> option, you can specify the credit period  allowed to the customer by selecting an appropriate payment term in the  <strong>Terms</strong> field.</p>

<p>This check box is disabled for the default POS customer since Everest  does not allow you to make credit sales to this customer.</p>
