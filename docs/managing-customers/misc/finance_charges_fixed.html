<h1 id="finance-charges---fixed">Finance Charges - Fixed</h1>

<p>A fixed amount is charged, irrespective of the value of the sales invoice,  if the amount is overdue for more than the specified number of days and  exceeds the minimum balance.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  Customer  ABC Inc. has  the following unpaid documents:</p>

<p><strong>Invoice #100 for $15000 due on December  15, 2000; amount paid $10000</strong></p>

<p><strong>Invoice #120 for $10000 due on December  31, 2000; amount paid $4000</strong></p>

<p><strong>Invoice #150 for $5000 due on January  15, 2001</strong></p>

<p><strong>The date when finance charges are calculated  is January 25, 2001.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A fixed amount of $100 is chargeable on  overdues exceeding  $15000, if the due date has lapsed by 15 days or more.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The documents to be considered for finance  charges are:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Invoice #100 - overdue by 41 days</strong></p>

<p><strong>Invoice #120 - overdue by 25 days</strong></p>

<p><strong>The total amount overdue on both these  documents is $11000 (6000+5000). As this amount is within the minimum  balance of $15000, no finance charges are chargeable on January 25, 2001.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Finance charges of $100 will become payable  on January 31, 2001 if amounts are not paid until that date.</strong></p>
