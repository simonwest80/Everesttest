# Finance Charges - Fixed


A fixed amount is charged, irrespective of the value of the sales invoice,  if the amount is overdue for more than the specified number of days and  exceeds the minimum balance.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â Customer  ABC Inc. has  the following unpaid documents:


**Invoice #100 for $15000 due on December  15, 2000; amount paid $10000**


**Invoice #120 for $10000 due on December  31, 2000; amount paid $4000**


**Invoice #150 for $5000 due on January  15, 2001**


**The date when finance charges are calculated  is January 25, 2001.**


**A fixed amount of $100 is chargeable on  overdues exceeding  $15000, if the due date has lapsed by 15 days or more.**


**The documents to be considered for finance  charges are:**


**Invoice #100 - overdue by 41 days**


**Invoice #120 - overdue by 25 days**


**The total amount overdue on both these  documents is $11000 (6000+5000). As this amount is within the minimum  balance of $15000, no finance charges are chargeable on January 25, 2001.**


**Finance charges of $100 will become payable  on January 31, 2001 if amounts are not paid until that date.**
