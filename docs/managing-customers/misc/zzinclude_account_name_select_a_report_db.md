Select this check box to print the customerâ€™s name as specified in the  **Account Name** field of the **Customer** profile on the shipping label.


Shipping labels use the address format specified in the **Country**  profile (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Country &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Country** profile **&gt; Format Address** tab). Check this  box only if the address format in the **Country**  profile does not include the $Account Name$  tag.
