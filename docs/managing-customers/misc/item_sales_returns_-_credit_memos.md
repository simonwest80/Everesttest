# Item Sales/Returns - Credit Memos


Use the **Item Sales/Returns** option  (path: **Customers** browser >  **Options** > **History 
 &gt; Item Sales/Returns &gt;Credit Memos**) to view the sales or  sales return documents created for the selected customer. When this option  is selected, the **Item Sales History**  browser for credit memos is displayed. By default, this browser is grouped  by the items contained in the document.


The items' sales/return history is useful to obtain the total quantities  of items ordered or purchased or returned by a customer.


The **Item Sales History** browser  displays all the items that have been included in credit memos and lists  all the credit memos in which the item is found. The details listed are  the document number, description, the item quantity, the price, document  date, amount of discount, tax code, asset and expense account.
