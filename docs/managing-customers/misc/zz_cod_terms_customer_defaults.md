title: COD Terms
---


Specify a default COD term to be used for any customer who is allowed  only COD terms (i.e. only the **Allow COD 
 Purchases** option is selected in the **Payment****Information** tab of the **Customer** profile). When you create a sales document for such customers,  the **Terms** field in the document  profile displays the payment term selected here by default.
