# On Account


On account purchases **** refer to  credit sales where the customer is allowed a credit period for making  the payments. When you select the **Allow 
 On Account Purchases** option, you can specify the credit period  allowed to the customer by selecting an appropriate payment term in the  **Terms** field.


This check box is disabled for the default POS customer since Everest  does not allow you to make credit sales to this customer.
