<p><strong>Pre-payments</strong> refer to full payments  made before the items are delivered.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  items are delivered to customers only after the credit card payment is  approved, check this box.</p>

<p>If the customer is allowed prepay terms, credit cards can be set up  for the customer that can be used to process payments.</p>

<p>Since the default POS customer is presumed to pay for items purchased  over the counter, the <strong>Allow Prepay Purchases</strong>  option is disabled.</p>
