# Items Sales/Returns - Credit Orders


Use the **Item Sales/Returns** option (path: **Customers** browser > **Options** > **History &gt; Item Sales/Returns &gt;Credit Orders**) to view the sales or sales return documents created for the selected customer. When this option is selected, the **Item Sales History** browser for credit orders is displayed. By default, this browser is grouped by the items contained in the document.


The items' sales/return history is useful to obtain the total quantities of items ordered or purchased or returned by a customer.


The **Item Sales History** browser displays all the items that have been included in credit orders and lists all the credit orders in which the item is found. The details listed are the document number, description, the item quantity, the price, document date, amount of discount, tax code, asset and expense account.
