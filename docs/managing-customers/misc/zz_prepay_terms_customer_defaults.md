title: Prepay Terms
---


Specify a default "prepay" term to be used for any customer  who is allowed only Prepay terms (i.e. only the **Allow 
 Prepay Purchases** option is selected in the **Payment****Information** tab of the Customer  profile). When you create a sales document for the customer, the **Terms** field in the document profile  displays the payment term selected here by default.
