<p>Specify an account selection methodology to be used for the  Customer profile. You can specify accounts without setting up posting  groups. If you prefer to use posting groups (groups of accounts), instead  of making individual account selections, that option is also available.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Accounts Based Upon Hierarchy</strong> – Select this option if you would  like the system to use customer control accounts at the location level  first (if defined) and then at the company level (accounting defaults).</li>
  <li><strong>Use 
 Posting Groups</strong> – Select this option if you would like to use Posting  Groups to define your accounts. If you select this option, you must enter  a “Customer Posting Group” in the <strong>Posting 
 Group</strong> field that appears when you make this selection.</li>
  <li><strong>Specify 
 Accounts</strong> – Select this option if you would like to specify the  customer control accounts to use for this Customer. Click the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/look_up_button_mc.gif" alt="" />  lookup  button to view the related accounts that can be defined. On the <strong>Accounts</strong> screen, select the <strong>Customer</strong><strong>Control Accounts</strong> that you would  like to define for this Customer. Click <strong>Apply</strong>  and then click <strong>OK</strong> to apply your  selections.</li>
