<p>This option displays the <strong>Multiple Receipt 
 Wizard</strong> that enables you to receive multiple payments from customers,  and make refunds, without having to make individual payments in the receipt  journal or from within documents.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/note.gif" alt="" />  From  the <strong>Customers</strong> browser, you can  select multiple customers, from whom you want to receive payments. You  do not need to specify <strong>Receipt Journal 
 Information</strong> and <strong>Document Criteria</strong> such as <strong>Payment Terms</strong> and  <strong>Document Aliases</strong> in the <strong>Multiple Receipts Wizard</strong>. These fields are automatically populated  with the selected customers information.</p>
