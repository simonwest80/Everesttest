<p>Customers include all entities to whom you sell or propose to sell your  products or services. You need to set up customers to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Track sales  opportunities for customers and customer prospects.</li>
  <li>Accept sales  orders.</li>
  <li>Accept customer  deposits.</li>
  <li>Bill a customer  for sales made.</li>
  <li>Manage tasks  and appointments for the customer or prospective customers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You have to set up a customer account for:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Each customer  account that has to be maintained.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you sell to two branches of the same company and want to track the details  of sale of each branch, you have to set up an account for each branch.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each currency  in which you invoice the same customer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you sell to two branches of ABC Inc.,  in France and in U.K.,  you must set up two accounts; one with currency as Euro  and the other as British Pound Sterling.</strong></p>

<p>However, two accounts are not required in  a situation where you always invoice the customer in a single currency  but receive payments in any currency.</p>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/managing-customers/img/example.gif" alt="" />  If  you always invoice ABC Inc.  in Euro, but  receive payments in either Euro  or British Pound Sterling, you do not require two accounts.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Each customer  prospect. To create sales opportunities for or track tasks associated  with the prospect.
    <ul>
      <li>Every vendor  that you sell to. If you sell to and buy from the same entity, you must  set up a separate customer and vendor account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>How you set up your customer database is critical to your sales function.  Besides billing and shipping information, the details specified in the  customer’s profile determine:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The price at  which you sell an item to a customer.
    <ul>
      <li>Discounts that  the customer is eligible for.</li>
      <li>Payment terms  allowed to the customer.</li>
      <li>Sales tax charged  on sales to the customer.</li>
      <li>Management  of the customer’s credit limit.</li>
      <li>The customer’s  access to your <strong>Everest</strong> online  store shop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
