<h1 id="database-update-disk-space-requirements">Database Update Disk Space Requirements</h1>

<p>Use the following formulas to determine the amount of disk space that  will be required for your database upgrade:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you select <strong>Yes, I wish to backup the data</strong> then  the amount of disk space required is 3.15 times the size of the database:</li>
</ul>

<p>(2 * Database Size) + (1 * Database Size) + (.15 * Database Size) =  3.15 * Database Size</p>

<p>This consists of:</p>

      <td>A copy of the database for the system to use in case the original database  update is not successful and additional space needed for processing –  This is approximately 2 times the database size. (The copy of the database  is removed after a successful update.)</td>

      <td>A backup copy of the database – This is your backup copy and it will  not be removed after a successful update. You can move this to another  drive to save space. This is approximately 1 times the database size.</td>

<p class="example">Example 1: Your original database is 1 GB and is located in the following  directory:</p>

<p>C:\Program Files\Icode\Everest\Data (example <strong>Everest</strong>  Database Server path)</p>

<p>You decide to back up the database to the same directory. You will need  approximately 3 GB in that directory to complete the update. You will  also need approximately 0.15 GB for a temporary MS SQL Server TempDB in  the directory where your MS SQL Server is installed.</p>

<p>2.00  GB – Used by the system during the database update</p>

<p><strong>+1.00 
 GB</strong> – A backup copy of the database made at your request</p>

<p><strong>**3.00 GB</strong>  – Approximate disk space required in the C:\Program Files\Icode\Everest\Data  directory (example Everest Database Server path)**</p>

<p><strong>**+</strong><strong>0.15 
 GB</strong> – Approximate disk space required in the directory where your  MS SQL Server is installed**</p>

<p><strong>**3.15 GB – Approximate 
 total of the disk space required for the update</strong>**</p>

<p class="example">Example 2: You determine that you do not have enough disk space on the  C: drive and you decide to place the backup copy of the database on the  D: drive. In this situation, you will need approximately 2 GB in the directory  on the C: drive and 1 GB in the directory on the D: drive. You will also  need approximately 0.15 GB for a temporary MS SQL Server TempDB in the  directory where your MS SQL Server is installed.</p>

<p><strong>**2.00 GB</strong>  – Used by the system during the database update – Approximate disk space  required in the C:\Program Files\Icode\Everest\Data directory (example  Everest Database Server path)**</p>

<p><strong>**1.00 GB</strong>  – A backup copy of the database made at your request (Approximate total  of the disk space required for database backup on the D: drive)**</p>

<p><strong>**+</strong><strong>0.15 
 GB</strong> – Approximate disk space required in the directory where your  MS SQL Server is installed**</p>

<p><strong>**3.15 GB – Approximate
