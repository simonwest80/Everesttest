# The Everest Contact Manager


The **Everest Contact Manager** tool  integrates **Contact Management** with  your business automation systems. Although there are several Contact Management  applications available; the advantages of using the **Everest 
 Contact Manager** are listed below:

1. The contact  and address information of customers and vendors need not be replicated.  You can use the **Everest** database  without having to track changes of addresses, telephone numbers and other  information in different databases, separately.
- Tasks and appointments  can be associated with relevant business information in the form of documents,  vendors and customers as it helps in easy retrieval of information.
