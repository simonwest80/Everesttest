# Modify an Appointment


You can modify appointment information from the **Calendar 
 View** profile.


{:.steps}
To modify an appointment, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Contact Manager**  > **Calendar View**. You will see  the **Calendar View** profile.
- From the **Calendar View** profile, highlight an  appointment to be modified from the **Scheduler**  and select **Edit &gt; In New Window**  from the right-click menu. You will see the **Appointment**  profile.
- From the **Appointment** profile, make the modifications  and select **Options &gt; Save**.



If you create an appointment for multiple users, the system creates  individual appointments for each user. Since the appointments created  become individual appointments, they must be modified individually.
