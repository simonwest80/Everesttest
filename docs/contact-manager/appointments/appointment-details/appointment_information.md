# Appointment Information


The **Appointment** tab allows you  to set appointment and reminders.


**Subject**
: Use this field to identify  the topic or content for the appointment.


**Display Appointments for**
: This field identifies the user code of the user  to whom the appointment is assigned. You can create an appointment for  more than one user at a time. But each time you create appointments for  multiple users, a separate appointment (with the same information) is  created for each user in the list.


**Start Date/Time**
: These fields denote the date and time of the appointment.
: The appointment created in any time zone can be  viewed in any other time zone. **Everest** automatically converts the time settings to the relative time zone.


![]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  your login time zone is **Eastern Time**  (GMT - 5) and you create an appointment for May 5, 2001 at 19 Hours (7  P.M.) and your user is in **Indian Standard 
 Time** (GMT +5.30), appointments for the user is displayed with reference  to **Indian Standard Time** (IST).  Thus the appointment created for May 5, 2001 (Eastern Time) would be displayed  as an appointment for May 6, 2001 at 5.30 A.M. for the user in IST.


**End Date/Time**
: This field **** displays  the date and time for the appointment to be completed.


**Set Reminder**
: This field allows you to display a reminder for  the appointment created.

If you have set a reminder for a user in your  local time, the reminder would be displayed for the users at the set date  and time respective to the users time zone.
