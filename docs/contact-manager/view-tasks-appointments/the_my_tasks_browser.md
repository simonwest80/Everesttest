# The My Tasks Browser


The My Tasks browser in Contact Manager displays tasks for a document/customer/vendor/work  order that have been defined for the current user.


{:.note}
Tasks with reminders set for the logged in  user have a ![]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/img/cm_alram.gif) icon beside them. If a task is marked as  **Complete and Followup**, the reminder  is carried forward to the new task.


The browser options are given below:

- [Options]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/misc/the_my_tasks_browser_options.html)
- [View]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/misc/the_my_tasks_view.html)
