# Assigned Users


The **Assigned Users** option allows  you to search for tasks/appointments assigned to a specific user. You  can enter partial values here, if you do not know the entire user code.  The search displays the list of users whose codes begin with the partial  value(s) specified.


{:.example}
If you know that the user code begins with  ‘3’, type 3 in this field. When you click the **Find** button, all users whose codes begin with ‘3’ are displayed in the  search result.


Click the drop-down button to view the history of prior search parameter  values.


{:.example}
If you had selected 1003 in your prior search,  **Everest** would have maintained  a history of that search. In your next search, the drop-down list for  the field **Assigned Users** displays  1003.


You can also select multiple users in this field; the word 'multiple'  is displayed in this field in a URL link format.


{:.steps}

- Click the browse  icon ![mi_browse_icon.gif]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/img/mi_browse_icon.gif) beside the **Assigned 
 Users** field. You will see the **Selection** dialog box.
