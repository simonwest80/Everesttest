# Subject


This option allows you to search for a task/appointment by the description  given in the **Item** profile. This  option is useful when you do not know the code of the task/appointment.


You can also search using partial values in the **Subject**  field if you do not know the entire subject. The search displays the list  of tasks whose subject begins with the partial value(s)  specified.


{:.example}
**You search for all tasks with Check Shipments  in the subject of the task. Type `Check' here and all the tasks whose  subject begins with this word are retrieved.**


Click the drop-down button to view the history of prior search parameter  values.
