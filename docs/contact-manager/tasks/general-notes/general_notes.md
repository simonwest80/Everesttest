# General Notes


You can enter notes that help users to record any relevant details and make it available for other users as well. A timer is automatically invoked to record the number of minutes and seconds for the duration of the call.

All general notes can be viewed or discontinued from the **Contact Manager** profile, **My Tasks** or **All Tasks** browser. General notes are added to the above browsers/profile and this icon ![]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) is displayed besides them.
