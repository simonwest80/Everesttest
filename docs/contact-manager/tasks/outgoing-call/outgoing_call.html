<p>You can record and track details of telephone calls to vendors and customers by using the Outgoing Call feature. A timer is automatically invoked to record the number of minutes and seconds for the duration of the call.</p>

<p>All outgoing calls can be viewed or discontinued from the <strong>Contact Manager</strong> profile, <strong>My Tasks</strong> or <strong>All Tasks</strong> browser. Outgoing calls are added to the above browsers/profile and this icon <img src="/versata-everest-docs/contact-manager/img/cm_outgoing_call_button.gif" alt="" /> is displayed besides them. Users can group by task to see the list of tasks, calls and notes. Also the user can group by date or sum on duration the total time spent on each type of call on a day.</p>
