# The Task Profile - Task


The **Task** tab allows you to define  a task and set reminders when necessary.


**Subject**
: Enter the topic or description for a task.


**Assign User(s)**
: Specify the user for whom you are creating a task.  You can create the task for multiple users by selecting them from the  drop-down list. A separate task (with the same task/description) is created  for each user in the list.


**Start Date/Time**
: Specify the start date and time for the task.
: A task created in any time zone, can be viewed in  any other time zone. **Contact Manager**  automatically converts the time settings to the relative time zone of  the user. By default, these fields display the time in the **Time 
 Zone** you have logged in, as specified in the **Default 
 Jurisdiction and Location/Sub-Location** dialog box.


{:.example}
If your login time zone is **Eastern 
 Standard Time** (GMT - 5), you create a task for May 5, 2001 at 11.00  a. a.m. and your user is in Los Angeles. The user will see the task as  if it was created on May 5, 2001 at 8:00 a. m with reference to **Pacific Standard Time** (GMT - 8).


{:.note}
Tasks and appointments can be created for  multiple users in any time zone.


**Due Date/Time**
: Specify the due date and time for task completion  .


**Status**
: Specify the status of the task. This field helps  you track a task’s progress. The following statuses are available for  selection:

- Not Started
- In Progress
- Completed
- Waiting on someone  else
- Deferred



**Priority**
: Set the importance level of the task as high, normal  or low.


**% Complete**
: Specify the percentage of the task that is finished.  You can use the up-down arrow keys to select the percentage.


{:.note}
Specifying a value here affects the **Status** field. When you specify 0% it  is displayed as **Not Started**; a  value between 1-99% displays it as **In 
 Progress**; and when you specify 100% it is displayed as **Completed**.


Tasks that are completed are displayed only  in the **Calendar View** window, accompanied  with a check mark.


**Set Reminder**
: Select this check box to specify the time and date  for the reminder to be displayed.


{:.note}
If you set a reminder for a user in your local  time, the reminder would be displayed at the date and time with respect  to the time zone of the user.
