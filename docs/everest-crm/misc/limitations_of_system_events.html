<ul>
  <li>Monitoring  business activities is limited to pre-defined events in <strong>Everest</strong></li>
  <li>Frequency of  monitoring events</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">Say, there are 10 events that are to be monitored. You set a frequency  for execution of the events on a weekly basis. This frequency is applicable  to all 10 events. You cannot set individual frequency for different events.</p>

<p>Further, out of the 10 events 2 are very critical events, which need  to be monitored on an hourly basis and the remaining 8 are non-critical  events, which can be monitored on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>In such a case, whatever frequency is set will hold good for both critical  and non-critical events.</p>

<p>However, in <a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-crm/crm-studio/advanced_crm.html">CRM  Studio</a>, it will be possible to set the frequency of the 2 very critical  events on hourly basis and for the remaining 8 events on a weekly basis.</p>
