# Create an Application


CRM Studio options are not available if your company is in the evaluation  mode.


For a registered company, you can create a CRM Studio Application. All  the queries and events are copied from the sample events to the new application.  It is advisable to create an application and copy the sample events into  it so as not to lose any data when the sample company is upgraded to its  newest version.


When you attempt to access any feature of the CRM Studio, you are informed  that an application is required for the company. You can opt to do one  of the following:


**Create a blank application**
: Select this option to create an application without  the sample events. This, however, does not affect the other activities  of CRM Studio.


**Create an application and copy sample events**
: Select this option to create an application with  all the sample events.
