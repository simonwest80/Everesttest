# Run Another Application


If you select the **Run Another Application**  option in the **Action** field of  the **Activity** profile, the user  specified in the **Notify User** field  (**Run Another Application Setup**  dialog box) is prompted whenever the event associated with the activity  occurs. Depending on the response from the user, the action is executed.  This is useful when you have to import details from some third party application  when an event is triggered. You can specify the application name in the  **External Application** field and  the user will be notified.


The **Run Another Application Setup**  dialog box is displayed when you click the edit action icon ![]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/img/crm_lookup_icon.gif) in the **Activity** profile.  Use this dialog box to specify an external application that should be  invoked when the action is executed.


{:.note}
You can also select **Edit 
 Action** option from the right-click menu in the **Process/Activities** browser, to bring up the dialog box.
