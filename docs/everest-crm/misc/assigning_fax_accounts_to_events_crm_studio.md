# Assigning Fax Accounts to Events


Similar to assigning e-mail accounts to events, you can assign fax accounts  to events if you want to send a fax upon triggering of an event. For each  event a fax account can be assigned or the same account can be assigned  for different events. When the event occurs, the fax is sent from the  account that you have specified.


{:.steps}
To assign fax accounts to events, do the  following:

- From the main  menu, select **CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect**. You will see the **Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect** dialog box.
- Under **Application Events** in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign the fax accounts.
- Select the  **Events** option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.
- Select the  event for which you wish to assign the fax account and double-click to  edit. You will see the **Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events** dialog box.
- Select the  **Fax** tab and specify the fax account.  You can specify a cover page or a template to be followed while sending  fax. You can also include text reports or text files as fax pages and  send.
