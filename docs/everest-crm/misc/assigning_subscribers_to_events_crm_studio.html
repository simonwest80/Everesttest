<p>You can add subscribers to events and link them in order to retrieve  subscriber information. Subscriber linking is the ability to have <strong>Everest</strong> retrieve subscriber information  (such as a person’s name, e-mail address, fax number, pager number, PIN,  etc.) from one or more external application databases.</p>

<p>Subscriber linking uses an established <strong>Everest</strong>  function – queries – to identify the subscribers you wish to link to.  Just as you would design a query to retrieve a specific set of database  records for an event, Subscriber Linking requires that you design a query  that identifies which records (within a database table) will be retrieved  and subsequently used as potential event subscribers.</p>

<p class="steps">To assign subscribers to events, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect</strong>. You will see the <strong>Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Under <strong>Application Events</strong> in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign subscribers.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Events</strong> option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the  event for which you wish to assign subscribers and double-click to edit.  You will see the <strong>Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Subscribers</strong> tab to add subscribers.</li>
</ul>
