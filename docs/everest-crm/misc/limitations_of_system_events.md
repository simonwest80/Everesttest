# Limitations of System Events

- Monitoring  business activities is limited to pre-defined events in **Everest**
- Frequency of  monitoring events



{:.example}
Say, there are 10 events that are to be monitored. You set a frequency  for execution of the events on a weekly basis. This frequency is applicable  to all 10 events. You cannot set individual frequency for different events.


Further, out of the 10 events 2 are very critical events, which need  to be monitored on an hourly basis and the remaining 8 are non-critical  events, which can be monitored on a weekly basis.


In such a case, whatever frequency is set will hold good for both critical  and non-critical events.


However, in [CRM  Studio]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/crm-studio/advanced_crm.html), it will be possible to set the frequency of the 2 very critical  events on hourly basis and for the remaining 8 events on a weekly basis.
