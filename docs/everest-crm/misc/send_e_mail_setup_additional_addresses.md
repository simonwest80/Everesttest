# Send E-mail Setup - Address Options


In the **To** tab, specify the recipients'  e-mail addresses to which you want to send mails. Use the **CC**  and **BCC**  tabs to send a copy or blind carbon copy to the recipient.


You can choose to send e-mails  to the e-mail IDs  specified in the Billing Address, Contact Address, Shipping or Return  Address or Sales representative, Purchase representative or User. If there  is no e-mail ID specified in the above addresses then e-mail will not  be sent.


You can also specify more e-mail IDs  by entering the same in the **Additional 
 Email Address** box below. Alternately, you can click the ![]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/img/crm_more_email_ids.gif) icon and select the recipients from the [Select  Email Ids]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/misc/select_e_mail_ids_dialog_box.html)  dialog box.
