<p>By scheduling events, you can manage when you want the activity to happen.  Event schedules determine how often an event is executed. For triggered  events, the schedule determines how often you wish to check to see if  the event has been triggered; for non-triggered events (e.g., periodic  reports), the schedule determines when (and how often) you wish to produce  and distribute the report data.</p>

<p>You create unlimited schedules and then associate one or more events  to each schedule. The benefit of associating multiple events to a single  schedule is that you can change the time and/or date of a schedule and  all the events that use it will be changed accordingly.</p>

<p class="steps">To schedule events, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect</strong>. You will see the <strong>Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Under <strong>Application Events</strong> in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign schedules.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Events</strong> option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the  event for which you wish to set a schedule and double-click to edit. You  will see the <strong>Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events</strong> dialog box.</li>
  <li>Select the  <strong>Schedule</strong> tab and specify appropriate  schedule for the event.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">You can either associate the event to a pre-existing  schedule, or you can create a new schedule.</p>
