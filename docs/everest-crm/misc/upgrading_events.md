# Upgrading Events


When you upgrade **Everest**, the  sample events installed previously are not automatically replaced by the  latest sample events available. You are prompted to upgrade them when  accessing any of the CRM Studio menu options.


{:.note}
You should verify the Release Notes for changes  related to the events used. If any of the events used has been mentioned  in the Product Release Notes, you should manually delete the respective  events in the 'Company' application and copy the events again from the  reference application (ASC).


{:.example}
You copy an event E1 from the reference pack  (ASC) and use  it in the application you created. During the next **Everest**  upgrade if event E1 is modified in the reference pack (ASC),  a mention will be made in the release notes. The user should verify this  and copy E1 again into his application from the upgraded reference pack.
