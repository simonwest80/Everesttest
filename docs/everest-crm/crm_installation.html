<p><strong>Everest CRM</strong>  is an add-on package to the <strong>Everest</strong>  suite of products. You have the option to buy the package either at the  time of purchasing <strong>Everest</strong>, or  at a later point of time.</p>

<p>For details, refer to <strong>Everest Advanced 
 Edition - CRM Studio</strong> Installation Guide.</p>

<ul class="note">
  <li>It is recommended  that you install <strong>CRM Studio Server</strong>  on a separate system (other than where <strong>Everest 
 Data Server</strong> is installed) to optimize performance.</li>
  <li>By default,  <strong>CRM Studio</strong> and the data files  install in the <strong>Everest</strong> directory.  They must be located on the same drive as <strong>Everest</strong>.   For example,  if you install <strong>Everest</strong> on the  C: drive, <strong>CRM Studio</strong> and the data  files must also be located on the C: drive. Similarly, if you install  <strong>Everest</strong> on the D: drive, <strong>CRM Studio</strong> and the data files must also  be located on the D: drive.</li>
  <li>When CRM Studio  server is installed on Windows 2000 server, the security for authenticated  users for <strong>Data</strong> directory (under  the CRM folder where <strong>Everest CRM Studio</strong>  is installed) should be manually edited and given full rights. Later this  can be revoked once an option is invoked under the CRM Studio menu in  the application.</li>
  <li>After installation  of <strong>CRM Studio Server</strong>, the user  should login to ASC company and invoke CRM - Architect. This will update  the ASC Company Application (for reference) with the latest sample events.  Later the user can access architect of his/her working company.</li>
  <li>There are two  sets of license keys used to activate <strong>CRM 
 Studio</strong>. The first one is entered during the installation of <strong>CRM Studio</strong> and the second one is entered  in the <strong>CRM Studio Architect</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>CRM 
 Studio</strong> activation codes are bound to the name of the server they  are installed on. If you need to re-install <strong>CRM 
 Studio</strong> on a different machine or rename it after the first 30 days,  a re-licensing charge will be incurred.</li>
</ul>
