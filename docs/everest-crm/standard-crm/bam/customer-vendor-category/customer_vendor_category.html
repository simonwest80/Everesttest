<p>Creating categories for customers and vendors eases business management  in CRM. You  can create groups for customers/vendors to identify or differentiate among  your various customers or vendors. This feature can be used in cases where  you have to mail to a group of customers or vendors depending on your  requirement.</p>

<p class="example">You might have regular customers whom you need to inform about the arrival  of new item in your shop. Instead of sending mails to each individual  you can create a category called “Regular”, include all the  regular customers under this category and send the mail to the group.</p>

<p>You may have foreign customers whom you want to inform about the increase  in shipping charges. You can create a category called “foreign”  so that you can easily identify and send the update.</p>

<p>Another scenario where you can create categories can be for distinguishing  retail vendors from wholesale vendors.</p>

<p class="steps">To create a customer/vendor category, do  the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>CRM 
 &gt; Business Activity Monitoring &gt; Setup &gt; Customer/Vendor Category</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Customer/Vendor Category</strong>  browser.</li>
  <li>From the browser,  select <strong>Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window</strong>.  You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-crm/standard-crm/bam/customer-vendor-category/the_customer_vendor_category_profile.html"><strong>Customer/Vendor Category</strong> profile</a>.</li>
</ul>
