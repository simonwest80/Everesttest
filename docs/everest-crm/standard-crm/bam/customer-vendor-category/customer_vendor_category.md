# Customer/Vendor Category


Creating categories for customers and vendors eases business management  in CRM. You  can create groups for customers/vendors to identify or differentiate among  your various customers or vendors. This feature can be used in cases where  you have to mail to a group of customers or vendors depending on your  requirement.


{:.example}
You might have regular customers whom you need to inform about the arrival  of new item in your shop. Instead of sending mails to each individual  you can create a category called "Regular", include all the  regular customers under this category and send the mail to the group.


You may have foreign customers whom you want to inform about the increase  in shipping charges. You can create a category called "foreign"  so that you can easily identify and send the update.


Another scenario where you can create categories can be for distinguishing  retail vendors from wholesale vendors.


{:.steps}
To create a customer/vendor category, do  the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Business Activity Monitoring &gt; Setup &gt; Customer/Vendor Category**.  You will see the **Customer/Vendor Category**  browser.
- From the browser,  select **Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window**.  You will see the [**Customer/Vendor Category** profile]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/standard-crm/bam/customer-vendor-category/the_customer_vendor_category_profile.html).
