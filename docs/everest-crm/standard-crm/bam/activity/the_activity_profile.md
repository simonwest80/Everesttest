# The Activity Profile


Use this profile to define activities for processes.


**Activity Number**
: This field specifies an identification number for  the activity being defined and is auto-generated by the system.


**Description**
: Enter a description for the activity.


**Event**
: Specify the event that is to be associated with  this activity. These are the events created in **Everest**.  When the event occurs, the action associated with it is triggered.


{:.example}
Whenever a sales invoice is created, you need  to send e-mail to the customer's billing address and a copy to the sales  representative. You can have an event as "Create sales invoice"  and an action "Send E-mail", and associate the action with the  event so that whenever a sales invoice is created, a mail is sent to the  respective e-mail addresses.


{:.note}
The action is executed for only new events  triggered after the setting up of the activity.


**Event Group**
: This is a display field and shows the group, to  which the event specified in the **Event**  field belongs.

**[]()Schedule Action**
: Specify when the action is to be triggered. You  can schedule it to execute immediately after the occurrence of the event  or schedule it according to your convenience. The following options are  available:

- **Immediate**  - executes the action immediately after the event occurs.
- **After 
 Event Date** - executes the action after the event date based on  the values specified in the **Days**,  **Hours**, or **Minutes**  field.



{:.example}
If you have specified the action as "Send  E-mail" and the **Days** field  has the value 2, the e-mail will be sent 2 days after the event has taken  place.

- **Based 
 on Reference Date** - When you select this option, the **Reference 
 Date** field appears. Reference dates are a set of pre-defined dates  in **Everest** and are associated  to event groups. Only those reference dates pertaining to the selected  event group are displayed in the drop-down list. The **Days**,  **Hours**, **Minutes**  and **Occurrence** fields can be used  to schedule when exactly the action is to be executed in accordance with  the reference date.



{:.example}
If the **Reference 
 Date** field **** contains the  value "Journal - Posting Date", the **Days** field has value "3" and the **Occurrence** field has value "After", the action is executed 3 days  after the journal posting has been done.
