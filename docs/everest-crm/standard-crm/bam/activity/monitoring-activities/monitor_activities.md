# Monitor Activities


This option allows you to monitor the activities that are executed when  events are triggered. Whenever an event occurs, the activity is monitored  and a record is made in the **Monitor Activities** browser. The status of this activity is pending. Once the action  associated with the activity is executed successfully, the record is moved  to the [**Activity 
 History** browser]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/standard-crm/bam/activity/monitoring-activities/activity_history.html). If the execution of the action  is unsuccessful, the status is "Error".


Each activity that is defined for a process can be monitored. For every  action defined, you can know the status - whether it is pending or if  any error has occurred - in the **Monitor 
 Activities** browser.


{:.steps}
To view the Monitor Activities browser, do  the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Business Activity Monitoring &gt; Monitor Activities**. You  will see the **Monitor Activities**  browser.



The browser contains left and right panels. The left panel displays  the actions and status for each action. The right panel displays the details  depending on the record and the status you select in the left panel.


You can also filter the records using the **Dates**  field. Only those records that fall within the specified date are displayed.


{:.example}
If you select **Send 
 E-mail** and **Errors** in the  left panel, all the erroneous records are displayed, i.e., those activities  for which error occurred while sending e-mail are displayed.
