# Sales Analysis


Sales analysis reports are displayed in the form of a browser and are  powerful tools to evaluate the current status and value of sales opportunities,  sales orders and sales. These reports provide critical information to  different functions such as Sales, Finance, Marketing and Distribution.


The reports can be configured to give relevant information to each of  the interested functions.


The sales analysis reports unlike the normal **Invoicing** reports display the information in a browser. You can manipulate  the information to suit your needs; for instance, you can filter out information  that you do not need.
