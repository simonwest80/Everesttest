# Tax Information


The employment taxes that you have to withhold or pay have to be specified  in the **Taxes** tab of the **Employee Template**.


The following check boxes FITA, FUTA, Social Security, Medicare, State  Income Tax, SUTA and SDI will default from their respectable check boxes  in the **Payroll Item - Taxability**  tab. You can check or uncheck if the particular employee needs to be taxed  or not based on the employee's filing state.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the FITA check box is checked in the **Payroll 
 Item - Taxability** tab, the same would be enabled and checked by  default in the **Employee - Taxes**  tab.
