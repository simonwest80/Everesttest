<p>Payroll for each employee is processed based on individual employee  data. Setting up of an employee’s information involves setting up of pay  details, tax filing status, the taxes applicable and the accounts and  cost centers to which the employee’s payroll expenses are allocated. The  creation of employee data can be tedious and repetitive, if the pay structure,  leave details and other information are similar for most employees.</p>

<p>The <strong>Employee Template</strong> simplifies  the tasks associated with employee setup. It allows you to set up a template  with employee information that is common to most of your employees. Whenever  you create an employee, the new employee’s profile is automatically populated  with the details in the template minimizing data entry work. Only those  details that are exclusive to employees are to be entered manually.</p>

<p>Details of the <strong>Employee Template</strong>  have been grouped into the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/setup/the-employee-template/employee_template_general.html">General  Information</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/setup/the-employee-template/tax_information_1.html">Tax  Information</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/misc/pay_details.html">Pay  Details</a></li>
</ul>
