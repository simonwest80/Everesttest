# Checklist for Payroll Items


It will be useful, if you make a checklist of the following before setting up payroll items:

- Prepare a list of all types of addition, deductions and company contributions.
- Prepare a list of fringe benefits given to your employees.
- Prepare a list of third party payments made to your employees (although these items are not  added to the employee's paycheck, they may have to be considered for withholding taxes).
