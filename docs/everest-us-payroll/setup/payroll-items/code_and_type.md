# Code and Type


**Code/Description**


The payroll item code and its description identify the payroll item.


**Type**


This field denotes the type under which the payroll item has to be categorized.  A payroll item can be of the following four types:

- [Additions]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/additions.html)
- [Deductions]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/deductions.html)
- [Company  Contribution]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/company_contribution.html)
- [Accruals]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/accruals.html)



**[]()Annual Limit**
: Select this check box for which the annual limit  needs to be set. Enter the amount in the field next to the check box.  This field indicates the annual limit for an employee for the payroll  item of type **Deductions** or **Company Contribution**. It means the total  amount of deductions or company contributions for the employee in the  calendar year should not exceed the amount mentioned in this field.
: This check box is enabled only if the options **Deductions** or **Company 
 Contribution** is selected in the **Type**  field.


{:.example}
If there are two payroll items ‘Company contribution  to 401K’ and ‘Employee Insurance deduction’  then you may decide to set the limit only for ‘Company contribution to  401K’ and so select the **Annual Limit**  check box, but leave it unchecked for the ‘Employee Insurance deduction’.  Where no amount is entered in this field, it would mean that there is  no limit for the particular payroll item.
