# State Code and ID


**State Code**
: The state code is the 2-letter identification code  of the state.


**State ID**
: The State ID is your employer identification number  for the state. If you pay state unemployment tax (SUTA), the State ID  appears in the Form 940 - the Federal Unemployment Tax Act return.


**Number of daily pay periods**
: <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">Using the annualizing factor, 
 ma</font>ny states annualize the taxable wages for calculating income  tax. The annualizing factor is the number of wage periods in a year and  is the same across all states for all wage periods except for the daily  wage period


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If an employee's taxable  wage is $1000 and he is paid half monthly, the state income tax is calculated  on $26000 ($1000 multiplied by the annualizing factor 26, the number of  semi-monthly wage periods in a year). This tax is then divided by 26 to  get the tax withholding per pay period<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">.</font>
: For daily pay periods, the annualizing factor differs  from state to state. Although most states and the Federal Government use  260 as the annualizing factor, some states like Delaware use other factors  like 300 or 360.
: ![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If daily wage is 100, and the annualizing factor 260 the  income tax for the year is calculated on 26000. It is then divide it by  260 to get the tax for a day.
: The annualizing factor for the state is displayed  by default. You may edit it, if the State Government changes the factor.
