<p>Although the United States has 52 states, your company may be registered  as an employer only in some of the states. <strong>Everest 
 US Payroll</strong> requires you to identify the states where you operate  and the taxes that you pay in each state for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To ensure that  you identify the payroll tax accounts for each state that you are likely  to pay taxes to.</li>
  <li>To minimize  data entry errors at the time of specifying an employee’s filing state  and SUTA state in the <strong>Taxes</strong> tab  of the <strong>Employee</strong> profile (path:  <strong>Payroll &gt; Employees &gt; Employee 
 Data</strong> &gt; From the <strong>Employees</strong>  browser, double-click on the required record &gt; <strong>Employee</strong> profile &gt; <strong>Taxes</strong> tab).</li>
  <li>If you are  paying the state unemployment tax, your state identification number must  be reported in the Form 940 - the Federal Unemployment Tax Act return.  The <strong>State Setup</strong> profile allows  you to specify the state ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>State Setup</strong> profile provides  information of the state in which your company is located and the taxes  applicable to that state. Contents of the <strong>State 
 Setup</strong> profile have been grouped into the following sections:</p>
