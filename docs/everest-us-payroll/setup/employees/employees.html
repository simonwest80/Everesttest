<p>An employee can be defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A person who  is in your employment and you are responsible for withholding tax on his/her  salary.</li>
  <li>A person who  is employed by a third party (e.g., a labor contractor) but you are responsible  for withholding taxes from his/her salary.</li>
  <li>A person who  is working for you and to whom you issue Form 1099 for non-employee compensation  (e.g., a person employed by you on a contract basis).</li>
</ul>

<p>Persons in the first two categories need to be set up as employees for  processing payroll. Persons in the third category need not be set up as  employees because they are on a contract basis and are not directly employed  by the company.</p>
