<p>US Payroll does not mandate that you set up information and begin payroll  transactions at the beginning of a calendar year. You may start using  payroll in the middle of a calendar year by setting up the history of  earlier payroll transactions.</p>

<p>If you are setting up <strong>Everest US Payroll</strong>  in the middle of a calendar year, you are required to enter the details  of all payroll transactions that have been paid till date. This process  is known as setting up <strong>Employee History</strong>.  This is necessary for creating statutory forms such as the Forms W2, 940  and 941.</p>

<p>When you set up an employee’s history, you may either enter the details  of individual transactions or the consolidated amounts for all previous  transactions.</p>
