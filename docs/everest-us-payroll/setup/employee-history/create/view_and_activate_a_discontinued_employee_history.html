<p>You can make a discontinued employee history available for selection  by activating it again.</p>

<p class="steps">To view and activate a discontinued employee  history, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Payroll &gt; Employees 
 &gt; Employee History</strong>. You will see the <strong>Employee 
 History</strong> browser.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Employee History</strong> browser, select <strong>Options &gt; View Discontinued</strong>. You  will see the <strong>Discontinued</strong> <strong>Employee History</strong> browser listing all  the discontinued records.</li>
  <li>Highlight the  record you want to activate.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Discontinued Employee History</strong> browser,  select <strong>Options &gt; Activate</strong>.  You will see the <strong>Confirm</strong> window.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to activate. The activated record  will be displayed in the <strong>Employee</strong><strong>History</strong> browser.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">If you activate a discontinued historical  transaction, subsequent payroll transactions that would have calculated  taxes on the year to date amounts will not include the transaction being  activated now.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong>  displays a warning if you activate a discontinued historical transaction  of an employee who has payroll transactions that are processed after the  historical pay date, in the same calendar year.</p>

<p>You can choose whether or not to activate  this transaction by clicking <strong>Yes</strong>  or <strong>No</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong>  also logs an event if you choose to re-activate such historical transactions.</p>
