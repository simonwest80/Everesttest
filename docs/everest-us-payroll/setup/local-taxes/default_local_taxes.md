# Default Local Taxes


**Everest US Payroll** has seven  predefined (or default) local taxes displayed in the **Local 
 Taxes** browser. You need not specify the rates for these taxes.


You must set up any other local tax that you or your employees are required  to pay.


The seven predefined local taxes are:

- New York City  Resident
- New York City  Non-resident
- Yonkers Resident
- Yonkers Non  Resident
- Wilmingon,  Delaware Earned Income Tax
- Montana Workers  Compensation Old Fund LT
- Oregon Workers  Compensation Fund



Although **Everest US Payroll**  automatically calculates the taxes for these local taxes, you must specify  the following information for any default local tax that you use:

- W2  description
- Liability  account for crediting the local tax withheld from the employee's paycheck
