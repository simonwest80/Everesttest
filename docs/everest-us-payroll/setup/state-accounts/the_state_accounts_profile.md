# State Accounts Details


The state taxes that you withhold from your employeesâ€™ paychecks and  the state employment taxes that you pay are debited or credited to the  accounts specified for that state.


State accounts may be specified at the employee level also. If the state  accounts are not specified for an employee in the **Employee 
 Account Setup** dialog box (path: **Payroll 
 &gt; Employees &gt; Employee Data** > from the **Employees** browser, select **Options &gt; Employee 
 Accounts**), the default accounts specified in the **State Accounts** dialog box are considered for entries.


**State Code**
: The code is the 2-letter code of the state for which  you are specifying the accounts. Only the states set up in the **State 
 Setup** profile are available for selection.
: The **State Accounts** dialog box **** is divided into  two sections:

- [State  Accounts - Employee]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/state-accounts/state_accounts_employee.html)
- [State  Accounts - Employer]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/state-accounts/state_accounts_employer.html)
