 W2 Tracking**. You will see the **Employee 
 Form W2 Tracking**.
- Click the box  for which you want to set up details. You will see the [Form  W2 Tracking Details dialog box]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/form_w2_tracking_details_dialog_box_sup.html) **** with  the respective box number. This box lists all the payroll items that can  be tracked in the **Unassigned** column.
