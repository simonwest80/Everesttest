# Federal Account Details


**Everest US Payroll** is totally integrated with accounting. You need not specify accounting entries for payroll transactions manually.  **Everest** automatically creates the payroll journal for selected transactions.


The **Federal Account Setup** dialog box allows you to specify the default accounts to be debited or credited in the payroll journal for the federal taxes withheld from employees’ paychecks and for the employer’s federal employment taxes.


The federal taxes payable by the company are not only a liability but also an expense.


Federal accounts may be specified at the employee level also. If the federal accounts are not specified for an employee in the **Employee Account Setup** dialog box (path: **Payroll &gt; Employees &gt; Employee Data** > from the **Employees** browser, select **Options &gt; Employee Accounts**), the default accounts specified in the **Federal Account Setup** dialog box are considered for entries.


The **Federal Account Setup** dialog box is divided into the following sections:

- [Federal Account Setup - Employee]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/federal-account-setup/federal_account_setup_employee.html)
- [Federal Account Setup - Employer]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/federal-account-setup/federal_account_setup_employer.html)
