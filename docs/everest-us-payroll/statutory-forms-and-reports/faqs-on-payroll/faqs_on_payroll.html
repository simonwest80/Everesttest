<p>Payroll taxes are those taxes that are withheld from your employees’  paychecks, as well as those taxes you pay as an employer based on the  wages you pay your employees. These include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social Security  and Medicare</li>
  <li>Federal and state  unemployment</li>
  <li>Personal income  tax (federal and state)</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous other  state taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>Most payroll taxes, such as income tax, apply to all earnings. However,  some taxes have what is called a wage cap. A wage cap is the maximum annual  earnings per employee that is subject to that tax. These caps may be adjusted  by the governing agency (typically annually).</p>

<p>Summary of the most common payroll taxes:</p>

<p>* - Employer also must pay State and Federal Unemployment Taxes (SUTA  and FUTA). The FUTA rate is 6.2 %, but you can take a credit of up to  5.4% for SUTA taxes that you pay. If you are eligible for the maximum  credit your FUTA rate will be 0.8%. The wage base for FUTA is $7,000.  You will stop paying FUTA for each employee once his or her wages exceed  $7,000 for the year.</p>

<p>Due to government regulations, pre-tax deductions, retirement, and annuity  contributions deducted from your paycheck may not be included in wages  subject to taxes. If you have none of these deductions or contributions  on your paycheck, your W-2 wages will equal your true gross wages.</p>

<p>Government regulations determine how each type of wages are reported  and taxed by the various federal and state agencies. Your W-2 will show  one or more of the following types of wages:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Box 3 – Social Security Wages</strong></dt>
  <dd>Wages that are subject to Social Security tax (corresponding  to OASDI gross  on</dd>
  <dd>your paystub).</dd>
  <dt><strong>Box 5 – Medicare Wages and Tips</strong></dt>
  <dd>Wages subject to Medicare taxes (corresponding to  HI gross on your paystub).</dd>
  <dd>Your gross wages for Social Security and Medicare  are reduced by “pre-tax” payroll deductions for health insurance, dental  insurance, vision insurance, AD&amp;D  insurance, NC Flex (dependant care and medical) and parking. If your Social  Security wages exceeded $97,500 in 2007, Social Security Tax was withheld  on the first $97,500 only.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Box 1 – Wages, Tips, Other Compensation</strong></dt>
  <dd>Wages subject to Federal income tax (corresponding  to Fed Gross YTD  on your</dd>
  <dd>paystub).</dd>
  <dt><strong>Box 16 – State Wages, Tips, Etc.</strong></dt>
  <dd>Wages subject to State income tax (corresponding  to State Gross YTD  on your paystub).</dd>
  <dd>Your gross wages for federal and state taxes are  reduced by the same “pretax” payroll deductions as Social Security and  Medicare. However, in addition, “pre-tax” deductions for retirement and  deferred compensation (annuity deductions) are also deducted.</dd>
</dl>

<p>NCSU employees  may participate in three types of tax deferred annuity programs: Code  Section 401(k), 403(b) and 457. IRS codes are explained on the back of  Form W-2 “Copy C,  Employee’s Record.” Other important information also is documented there.</p>

<p>Following is a wage base table showing how gross wages for Boxes 1,  3, 5 and 16 on your W-2 are calculated.</p>

<p>Non-wage compensation includes all “WIK”  coded on your paychecks. This could include, but is not limited to cash  awards, bowl game amenities, taxable moving expenses, football or basketball  season tickets, gift certificates, car allowances/courtesy car, athletic  meals, etc.</p>

<p>Pre-tax insurances include health insurance,  dental, vision, flexible spending accounts (medical and dependent care),  AD &amp; D and pre-tax parking.</p>

<p>FICA taxable gross is divided into two parts.  OASDI gross  (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) includes wages up to the  $97,500 maximum for 2007. HI gross is Medicare gross which has no maximum  dollar limit. These are shown on your paycheck as OASDI  and HI.</p>

<p>Retirement includes any of the retirement plans.</p>

<p>Annuities include 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans.</p>

<p>The Earned Income Credit (EIC)  is available to qualifying low-income workers. Two factors determine the  amount of an individual’s EIC:  the number of qualifying children and the individual’s earned income.  The credit is phased out when income exceeds specific thresholds.  For  more information on the maximum credits and phase-out thresholds for 2007,  visit the IRS website at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc601.html">http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc601.html</a></p>

<p>Eligible employees who wish to receive ADVANCE payments of the Earned  Income Credit must submit a completed Form W-5 to their employer. There  are three tables for determining the applicable advance payment amount.  For more information on the payment tables for the year 2007, visit the  IRS website at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc601.html">http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc601.html</a></p>

<p>This is a reference period used by the IRS to determine your federal  tax payment due dates. The IRS evaluates your tax liability during this  twelve-month period and determines whether you are a monthly or a semi-weekly  depositor (see below) for the coming year.</p>

<p>All new employers are monthly depositors.</p>

<p>Federal Tax Deposit Schedules</p>

<p>The following deposit schedules apply to all federal taxes other than  FUTA.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Monthly depositors</strong></dt>
  <dd>You are a federal monthly depositor in 2007 if your  company’s federal tax liability during the look-back period (7/1/05-6/30/06)  was less than $50,000. This is why all new employers are monthly depositors.  Monthly depositors pay taxes for a given month by the 15th of the next  month. For example, June taxes are due by July 15th. (However, if the  15th falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the taxes are due the next banking  day.)</dd>
  <dt><strong>Semi-weekly depositors</strong></dt>
  <dd>If your look-back liability is greater than $50,000,  you are a semi-weekly depositor. You pay taxes three banking days after  the end of any semi-weekly period in which you accrued a liability. The  IRS divides the week into two periods: (1) Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday,  and (2) Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Taxes accrued during the  Wednesday-Friday period are due on the following Wednesday, and taxes  accrued during the Saturday-Tuesday period are due on the following Friday.</dd>
  <dd>In some cases, when a bank holiday (such as July  4th or Christmas) occurs during the week, semi-weekly depositors have  an extra day to make their tax payment.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Exceptions to the Deposit Schedule Rules</strong></p>

<p>There are two main exceptions to the monthly and semi-weekly tax deposit  requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Next-Day Deposit Rule</strong>: If you  accrue $100,000 or more in federal tax liability at any point during a  deposit period, you must remit taxes on the next banking day. This could  result from a single payroll, or it could result from multiple payrolls  within a single deposit period (month or semi-week). For example, if you  are a monthly depositor and pay a one-time bonus to employees that results  in more than $100,000 in liability on a single day, you must pay the amount  due immediately. You also become a semi-weekly depositor until your look-back  liability falls below the $50,000 threshold again.</p>

<p>Unlike other federal taxes, FUTA  (federal unemployment tax) is paid on the last day of the month following  the end of each quarter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>April 30 (for Q1)</li>
  <li>July 31 (for Q2)</li>
  <li>October 31 (for  Q3)</li>
  <li>January 31 (for  Q4)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you accrue less than $100 of FUTA  liability in a quarter, you do not need to make a deposit until the following  quarter.</p>

<p>The year-to-date amount appearing on the last pay check of the calendar  year is the employee’s ‘gross’ compensation for the year, that is, the  total amount earned.</p>

<p>The amount appearing in Box 1 is the federal taxable wage, that is,  the amount earned which is subject to federal income tax. Tax-exempt deductions,  such as health care premiums, have been subtracted from the gross wage.</p>

<p><strong>1. Comparing your W-2 and your final 
 paycheck:</strong></p>

<p>The Federal Taxable Wages reported in Box 1 (Wages, Tips, and Other  Compensation) on the W-2 is generally the same amount that is reported  as the Federal Taxable Gross on your final pay stub for the calendar year  2007.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions to this. The most common is the reporting  of payments for Taxable Expenses (e.g. non-overnight meals) that are not  reported on the pay stub. This is reported as EXP in Box 14 of the W-2  statement.</p>

<p><strong>2. Explaining W-2 wage reporting differences:</strong></p>

<p>Social Security Wages (Box 3) and Medicare Wages (Box 5) are in many  instances different from the amount reported for Federal Taxable Wages  in Box 1. These differences, for the most part, are created by deductions  taken for 414(h) ERS Retirement Before Tax, 403(B) Tax Deferred Annuities,  or the NYS Deferred Compensation Program. Also, because the maximum Social  Security Wage is $97,500, the Box 3 amount will be capped at this amount.</p>

<p><strong>3. Reporting deductions for non-taxable 
 health insurance:</strong></p>

<p>The total amount deducted for non-taxable health insurance is reported  as a year-to-date amount on your final pay stub for the calendar year.  Non-taxable health insurance is not reported in the W-2 boxes for Federal  Taxable Wages, Social Security Wages and Medicare Wages.</p>

<p>Retain your last check stub of 2007 for a record of the Non-taxable  Health Insurance paid in 2007.</p>

<p><strong>4. Reporting deductions for charitable 
 contributions through SEFA:</strong></p>

<p>The total amount deducted for SEFA is reported as a year-to-date amount  on your final pay stub for the calendar year. Your total charitable contributions  through SEFA is not reported in the W-2.</p>

<p>Retain your last check stub of 2007 for a record of the SEFA amount  for tax purposes.</p>

<p><strong>5. Reporting deductions for the health 
 care spending account:</strong></p>

<p>The total amount deducted for the health care spending account is reported  as a year-to-date amount on your final pay stub for the calendar year.  This deduction is not reported in the W-2 boxes for Federal Taxable Wages,  Social Security Wages and Medicare Wages.</p>

<p>401(k) is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and  invest for their own retirement. Through a 401(k), you can authorize your  employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck before  taxes are calculated, and to invest it in the 401(k) plan. Your money  is invested in investment options that you choose from the ones offered  through your company’s plan. The federal government established the 401(k)  in 1981 with special tax advantages, to encourage people to prepare for  retirement. They get their catchy name from the section of the Internal  Revenue Code which established them (you guessed it, section 401(k)).</p>

<p>You decide how much money you want deducted from your paycheck and invested  during each pay period, up to the legal maximum (the IRS sets an annual  dollar limit each year). You also decide how to invest that money, choosing  from your plan’s different investment options. The money you contribute  to your 401(k) account is deducted from your pay before income taxes are  taken out. This means that by contributing to a 401(k), you can actually  lower the amount you pay each pay period in current taxes. For example,  if you earn $1,000 each paycheck, and you contribute, say 5% ($50), you  are only taxed on $950. You don’t owe income taxes on the money until  you withdraw it from the plan, when you could be in a lower tax bracket.</p>

<p>Yes, payroll taxes need to be withheld and a W-2 prepared at the end  of the year, regardless of how long they worked or how much they earned.</p>

<p>FICA taxes are made up of two parts. The first part is Social Security  which finances the old-age, survivors’ and disability insurance. The employee  tax rate for Social Security is 6.2% of wages up to $97,500 during 2007.  Medicare, the second part, finances hospital insurance. The tax rate for  Medicare is 1.45% of all taxable earnings.</p>

<p>The employer matches the amount of FICA withheld from the employee.  That means the employer pays to IRS the employee’s part of the taxes as  well as the matching amount.</p>

<p>An employer must pay Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) to the IRS. This  provides for payments of unemployment compensation to workers who have  lost their jobs. The tax applies to the first $7,000 you pay each employee  as wages during the year. Generally, the amount is determined by multiplying  taxable wages paid during the quarter by .008 (.8%). The wage base for  State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) also differs between States.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="" /> In Massachusetts,  the State Unemployment Insurance applies to the first $10,800 of wages.</p>

<p>SUI rates vary from company to company as determined by the company’s  actual experience with unemployment claims against it.</p>

<p>The 941 deposit is made up of the FICA taxes (both the employee portion  and the employer match) and the federal taxes withheld from employee income.</p>

<p>No, it is due the next business day.</p>

<p>The designated Roth contribution is an elective deferral allowed by  401 (k) or  403 (b) plan that has been elected irrevocably by a participant. This  is not excludable from participant’s Gross salary and to be contributed  into a designated Roth contribution. Under Internal Revenue Code section  402A, added by the <strong>Economic Growth and 
 Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001</strong> (EGTRRA), the participant  may elect to make whole or part of his elective deferrals as  designated  Roth contributions that would require a plan to maintain a separate Roth  contribution account balance, withdrawals, gains and losses. This separate  account must be maintained until the designated Roth contribution account  is completely distributed.</p>

<p>Yes, the participant can elect contributions to both a designated Roth  account and a pre-tax account in the same fiscal year in any proportion  he choose. However, the combined amount contributed in any one year is  limited by the 402(g) limit - $15,000 for 2006 ($15,500 in 2007 plus an  additional $5,000 in catch-up contributions if age 50 or older.</p>

<p>No, the designated Roth contribution is irrevocable. Once they are designated  as Roth contributions, they cannot later be changed to pre-tax elective  contributions.</p>
