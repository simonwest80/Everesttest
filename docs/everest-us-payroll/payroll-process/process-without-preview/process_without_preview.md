# Process without Preview


The **Process without Preview**  option allows you to process payroll for a group of employees. Normally,  all payroll transactions are made in a batch.


When **Process without Preview**  is selected, the payroll details for the selected employees are automatically  calculated using their normal regular hours, salary for the pay period  and the predefined additions, deductions and company contributions. No  data for the transaction is required during the processing.


When you process payroll transactions without preview, transactions  are created for the selected employees using the following information  specified in the **Employee** profile  (path: **Payroll &gt; Employees &gt; Employee 
 Data**, from **** the **Employees** browser, double-click the required record).

- Regular hours  that the employee must work in the payroll period - It is presumed that  the employee has worked all the regular hours; the employee has not worked  any overtime hours and has not taken any sick or vacation leave.
- Basis of payment  for payroll items that is calculated as a rate or percentage is presumed  to be 0.
- If the amount  for payroll items specified in the **Pay 
 Details** tab of the **Employee**  profile is paid as a flat amount.
