<p>When you process payroll with the option <strong>Process 
 without Preview</strong> there is a possibility of errors being generated.  Error log files are created by default, and are saved on your system.  You can change the default path, if required. You can either overwrite  or append to the existing error log file.</p>

<p>The default path for the error log file and the options <strong>Append</strong>  and <strong>Overwrite</strong> are provided with  the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/misc/payroll_transaction_processing_error_log_file_ptp.html">Payroll  Transaction Processing - Error Log </a>section of the wizard.</p>
