<h1 id="reverse-payments-browser">Reverse Payments Browser</h1>

<p>The <strong>Reverse Payments</strong> browser  (path: <strong>Accounting</strong> &gt; <strong>US 
 Payroll</strong> &gt; <strong>Payments</strong> &gt;  <strong>Reverse Payment</strong>) lists all original  payment payroll transactions for which a payment journal has been created.  When you reverse a transaction in this browser, <strong>Everest</strong>  reverses it but you will not be able to perform further reversing, purging,  or voiding on this transaction. If you reverse and recreate a transaction  in this browser, <strong>Everest</strong> replaces  the reversed transaction with the new recreated one.</p>

<p class="note">Only those transactions that have check number  assigned and printed can be reversed.</p>

<p>Information in the Reverse Payments browser is grouped into the following  sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/misc/view_options_reverse_payment_browser.html">View  Options</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/misc/transactions_grid_reverse_payment_browser.html">Transactions  Grid</a></li>
</ul>
