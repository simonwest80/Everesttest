# Ways of Reversing Payments


**Everest US Payroll** allows you  to reverse the payments created for a particular transaction record. You  may need to reverse payment records to rectify errors in payments.


Reversal entries are required to nullify the accounting effect of the  original payment entry. The original payment entry is a system entry and  cannot be deleted; hence, it is marked as “Reversed” and a reversal payment  entry is created.  A  Reversal payment entry is also required for audit trails.


Using the following options available from the **Reverse 
 Payments** browser (path: **Accounting**  > **US Payroll** > **Payments**  > **Reverse Payment**), you can  either permanently remove the payroll payment  transaction  or recreate a new one:

- Purge - This option  allows you to permanently delete the payroll payment transaction. Use  this option for computerized checks that are not printed or for zero amount  payroll transactions.
- Reverse Payment  - Use this option to reverse and recreate a payroll payment that has a  check number assigned.  When  you select this option, **Everest**  creates a reversal payment entry for the original transaction, and an  new payment entry to recreate it. The reversed and recreated payroll entry  will appear in this browser itself.
