<p>The following options (path: <strong>Reverse 
 Payments</strong> browser &gt; <strong>Options</strong>)  are available in the <strong>Reverse Payments</strong>  browser.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Select/Unselect/Select All/Unselect All</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use these options to select or unselect individual  or all transaction records from the transactions grid.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Purge</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use this option for computerized checks that are  not printed or for zero amount payroll transactions. When you select this  option, the transaction is removed from the <strong>Reverse 
 Payments</strong> browser and moved to <strong>Void 
 Payroll Journal</strong> dialog box. This enables you to create another  payroll transaction for the same period and print the check.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Reverse Payment</strong></dt>
  <dd>Use this option to reverse and recreate a payment  journal that has a check number assigned.  When  you select this option, <strong>Everest</strong>  creates a reversal entry for the original transaction, and an entry to  recreate it. If you have just reverse a payment journal, the reversed  and the reversal entry will no longer appear in this browser. However,  it will appear in the <strong>Void Payment Journal</strong>  dialog box and will create a new journal entry for reversal in <strong>Unposted 
 Payment Journal</strong> browser. If you have reversed and re-created an  entry, only the re-created entry will appear in this browser.  Also,  two new journal entries for the reversal and reversed journal will appear  in <strong>Unposted Payment Journal</strong> browser.  You can choose the transaction dates for both entries as the date of the  original transaction or a different date.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All the other options available in this browser are standard options  common to all browsers in <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>
