# Payroll Journal Dialog Box


The **Payroll Journal** dialog box (path: **Payroll &gt; Payroll Journal &gt; Create Payroll Journal**) lists all transactions whose pay dates fall within the Active accounting period. If there is no Active accounting period defined, it lists all the transactions that fall within the Open accounting period. Only transactions for which a payroll journal has not been created are listed.


This dialog box may list a regular and supplemental payroll transaction for the same employee or two transactions for the same employee for two different payroll periods, if a payroll journal has not been created for them.


Information on the **Payroll Journal** dialog box has been grouped into the following sections:
