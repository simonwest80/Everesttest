# Process with Preview


If you process payroll transactions using the option **Process 
 with Preview**, you can view the payroll transactions for each selected  employee, make the required changes, and then save the transaction.


The **Payroll Transactions** profile  of the employee selected in the **Payroll 
 Transaction Processing** section of the wizard is displayed.


The default pay data for each employee selected comes up in the **Payroll Transactions** profile. You may  enter details for the payroll period and save the transaction or move  to the next employee.
