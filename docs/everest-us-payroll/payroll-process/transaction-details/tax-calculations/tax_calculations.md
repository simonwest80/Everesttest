# Tax Calculations


**Everest US Payroll** automatically  calculates the taxes for federal income tax, FICA taxes (social security  and medicare taxes), income tax for all states and for the 7 default local  taxes.


**Everest** uses a tax DLL  for the calculation of these taxes. The tax DLL  for each year will be found in your application server. As and when the  rates for these taxes change, Everest Software provides you with an updated DLL.


The rates for FUTA, SUTA, SDI and local taxes for each year must be  set up using the respective dialog boxes.
