<h1 id="leave-adjustment-details">Leave Adjustment Details</h1>

<p>The <strong>Leave Adjustment</strong> tab displays  details of the sick and vacation leaves credited to the employee’s leave  account, which can be utilized by the employee at a later date.</p>

<p>The amount accrued for the sick and vacation hours credited to the employee  in the payroll period is accounted for by debiting the amount to the expense  account specified for the sick accrual and vacation accrual types of payroll  items and by crediting the amount to the liability accounts for accruals.</p>

<p>The accounts specified for these items in the <strong>Pay 
 Details</strong> tab of the <strong>Employee</strong> profile  are used. If these accounts are not specified, then the default accounts  for the payroll items of type sick accrual and vacation accrual are used.</p>

<p class="note">This amount is derived by multiplying the  number of hours credited with the vacation pay rate and sick pay rate  specified in the <strong>Employee</strong> profile.</p>

<p>Information on this tab has been grouped into the following sections:</p>
