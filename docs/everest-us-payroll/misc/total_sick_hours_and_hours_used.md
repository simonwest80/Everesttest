# Total Sick Hours and Hours Used


**Total Sick Hours**
: This is the total number of sick hours credited  to an employee in a calendar year. An employee's leave account is credited  with a proportionate amount of leave for every pay period.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  total sick hours are 72 and an employee's pay period is monthly, the employee  is credited with 6 hours every pay period.


**Sick Hours Used**
: This denotes the number of sick hours availed by  an employee to date in the current calendar year. When you set up **Everest US Payroll**, this value should  exclude hours utilized in the current pay period.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the employee's pay  period is monthly and you are setting up **Everest 
 US Payroll** in July, enter the hours utilized in the year up to  June. When **** the **** payroll transaction is run for the month of July, **Everest**  will add the hours utilized in July to this balance.
