# State Taxes


**Filing State**
: This is the state from where the employee is filing  the income tax. The state income tax for an employee is calculated for  his filing state. Only the states for which you have specified the tax  applicability in the **State Setup**  profile (path: **Payroll &gt; Setup &gt; 
 State** > from the **State Setup**  browser, double-click the required record) are available for selection.
: If the employee's filing state does not charge the  income tax, then **S**tate exemptions,  **State extra withholding** and **Miscellaneous Information** fields are  disabled.
