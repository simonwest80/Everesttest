<p><strong>Miscellaneous Information</strong></p>

<p>The employee information to compute state income tax withholding differs  from state to state. Some states require additional information for the  employee. Depending on the filing state, this field displays the additional  information required. This field is disabled, if the <strong>Filing 
 State</strong> does not require additional information.</p>

<p>This information could be in the form of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list from  which you must select the information applicable to the employee.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the filing state is Alabama, the options listed are ‘Not claiming personal  exemption’  and ‘Claiming personal exemption’  from which you must select the appropriate information.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A message prompting  you to specify an amount or percentage in the <strong>Amount/Percentage</strong>  field.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the filing state is Arizona, the message displayed is ‘Enter the percentage  of federal tax withholding’.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A list from  which you will have to not only select the applicable option but also  enter the information required for that option.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If  the filing state is Nebraska, the options listed are ‘Residents’ and ‘Non-resident  in Nebraska - enter the apportionment percentage from allocation certificate’.  If you pick the second option, you will have to enter the apportionment  percentage.</strong></p>
