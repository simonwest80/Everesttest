# Max Balance and Reset Vacation


**Max balance of vacation hours**
: This is the maximum balance of vacation hours that the employee can have in his leave account. Credits to an employee's balance account are restricted based on the maximum balance.
: If there is no limit on the balance for vacation hours, you can leave this field blank.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If the maximum balance of vacation hours is 160, and the employee has 156 hours in his leave balance, the next credit to the employee's leave account cannot exceed 4 unless the employee utilizes some of the balance.


**Reset vacation every new year**
: This option is used to specify whether the balance of vacation hours has to be reset to zero at the beginning of a calendar year.
