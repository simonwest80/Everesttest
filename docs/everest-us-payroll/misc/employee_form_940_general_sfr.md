Name of the company that you specified in the **Payroll 
 Company Setup** profile is displayed.

Enter the trade name, if it differs from the company name specified  in the **Payroll Company Setup** profile.

The address and zip code of your company specified in the **Payroll 
 Company Setup** profile are displayed.

Select the year for which you want to create Form 940.

The employer ID number is the federal identification number specified  in the **Payroll Company Setup** profile.  This number is displayed by default.


If you pay a tax preparer to fill out Form 940, make sure the preparer  shows your business name and EIN exactly as they appear on the preprinted  form we sent you or as assigned by the IRS.


If you are using a copy of Form 940 that has your business name and  address preprinted at the top of the form, check to make sure that the  information is correct. Carefully review your EIN to make sure that it  exactly matches the EIN  assigned to your business by the IRS. If any information is incorrect,  cross it out and type or print the correct information.


If you are not using a preprinted Form 940, type or print your EIN,  name, and address in the spaces provided. You must enter your name and  EIN here and on page 2. Enter the business (legal) name that you used  when you applied for your EIN on Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification  Number. For example, if you are a sole proprietor, enter “Ronald Smith”  on the Name line and “Ron's Cycles” on the Trade Name line. Leave the  Trade Name line blank if it is the same as your Name.


The IRS monitors tax filings and payments by using a numerical system  to identify taxpayers and to make sure that businesses comply with federal  tax laws. A unique 9-digit EIN is assigned to all corporations, partnerships,  and some sole proprietors. Businesses that need an EIN must apply for  a number and use it throughout the life of the business on all tax returns,  payments, and reports.


Your business should have only one EIN. If you have more than one and  are unsure which one to use, contact IRS to verify your correct EIN.

: If this is an amended return that you are filing  to correct a return that you previously filed, check box a.

: Check box b if you are a successor employer and:
: You are reporting wages paid before you acquired  the business by a predecessor who was required to file Form 940 because  the predecessor was an employer for FUTA tax purposes, or you are claiming  a special credit for state unemployment tax paid before you acquired the  business by a predecessor who was not required to file Form 940 because  the predecessor was not an employer for FUTA tax purposes.
: A successor employer is an employer who acquires  substantially all the property used in a trade or business of another  person (predecessor) or used in a separate unit of a trade or business  of a predecessor, and immediately after the acquisition, employs one or  more people who were employed by the predecessor.

: If you are not liable for FUTA tax for 2007 because  you made no payments to employees in 2006, check box c. Then go to Part  7, sign the form, and file it with the IRS.

: If this is a final return because you went out of  business or stopped paying wages and you will not be liable for filing  Form 940 in the future, check box d. Complete all applicable lines on  the form, sign it in Part 7, and file it with the IRS.
