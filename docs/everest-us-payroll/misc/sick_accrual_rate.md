# Sick Accrual Rate


**Sick Accrual Rate**
: This is the rate at which you accrue liability for  sick hours credited to the employee's leave account. This rate can be  different from the sick pay rate. If you do not accrue liability for sick  pay, you need not enter any amount.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) **** If an employeeâ€™s sick pay is $12 per hour  and you want to accrue liability for sick pay, you can set up an accrual  rate of $12 for the employee. If the employee's sick leave account is  credited with 2 hours, then an accounting entry will be created to accrue  the liability by debiting the sick leave accrual expense account and crediting  the sick leave accrual liability account. This entry is created only for  sick leave accrual. For sick hours utilized, another entry is made debiting  the expense account associated with the payroll item.


{:.note}
If you enter an amount greater than 0 in this  field, you must also add a payroll item of the type sick accrual in the  **Pay Details** tab of the **Employee**  profile**.**
