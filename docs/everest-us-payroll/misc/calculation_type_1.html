<h1 id="calculation-type">Calculation Type</h1>

<p>The calculation type identifies how the payroll item’s amount is calculated.</p>

<p class="example">Sales commission may be calculated as a percentage  of sales. Mileage reimbursement may be calculated as a rate multiplied  by the kilometers traveled. Bonus may be paid as a flat amount. Assume  that the mileage reimbursement is at the rate of 0.50 per mile. In this  case, the employee’s mileage reimbursement would be calculated by multiplying  the miles by the rate.</p>

<p>If the calculation type is percentage or rate, then the amount of payroll  item is calculated for the base amount every payroll period. The calculation  type for the same item may differ from employee to employee in the same  organization.</p>

<p class="example">A sales person may be paid an incentive based  on percentage whereas a factory worker may be paid a flat amount of incentive  every payroll period.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Additions</li>
  <li>Deductions</li>
  <li>Company contributions</li>
</ul>
