title: Company Paid Expenses

If the Employee profile specifies a payroll item of the type “**Additions**” and pay type “**Company 
 Paid** **Benefit**”, **Everest 
 US Payroll** automatically calculates and displays the total in this  field. You cannot modify this field if it is automatically calculated.  If necessary, you can change this amount in the Additional Earnings and  Deductions section. If the Employee profile does not specify company paid  benefits, you can enter the amount of the company paid benefit in this  field.
