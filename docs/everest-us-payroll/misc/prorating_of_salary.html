<p>The salary of the employee is prorated, if the joining date is after  the start date of the payroll period or the release date is before the  end date of the payroll period. Salary is prorated by dividing the salary  payable for the entire period by the number of regular hours that the  employee should have worked in that payroll period and multiplying it  by the number of actual hours worked.</p>

<p>Prorated salary = (Yearly salary/number of payroll periods in a year)  * (regular hours worked in a payroll period/regular hours set up in the  <strong>Employee</strong> profile&gt; <strong>General</strong>  tab)</p>

<p>The employee’s salary is assigned to the payroll item of type salary  in the employee’s pay details.</p>
