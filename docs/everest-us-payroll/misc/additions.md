# Additions


‘Additions’ are the payroll items that are added to an employee's pay.  The addition may be a fringe benefit or a monetary payment.


{:.example}
Bonus is a monetary payment whereas company paid accommodation  is a fringe benefit.


‘Additions’ are added to an employee's paycheck unless it is of the  type ‘Third-party Payments’ or ‘Company-paid benefits’.


A ‘Third-party Payment’  is an item paid by a third party to an employee for which the employer  is responsible for calculating and withholding the tax.


{:.example}
Tips given to an employee by a customer is  a third-party payment.


A ‘Company-paid benefit’  is a fringe benefit that is provided by an employer to the employee. The  value of fringe benefits provided has to be included for computing the  tax withholding of an employee. Although it is an expense to the company,  it is not a direct item of payroll expense as it is already accounted  for in the related expense account.


{:.example}
Company-paid accommodation is a fringe benefit.  But it is not a direct item of payroll expense.


All ‘Additions’ except ‘Third-party Payments’ and ‘Company-paid benefits’  are an expense to the company at the time of processing the payroll for  an employee.
