title: Social security tips
---


The taxable amount of social security tips is displayed in this field.  This box displays the employee's reported tips for the calendar year,  even if the employee's funds are insufficient to collect the Social Security  tax. You need to track the payroll item Tips (which is generally created  as a payroll item of the type 'Additions' and the Pay type" Third  Party payments') to this field. You can also track any other type of payroll  item to this field; there is no restriction on that. However the Social  security tax withheld (Box 4) is calculated on the sum of the Social security  wages (Box 3) and only the taxable portion of the Social security Tips  in Box (Box 7).


Report all tips in box 1 along with wages and other compensation.
