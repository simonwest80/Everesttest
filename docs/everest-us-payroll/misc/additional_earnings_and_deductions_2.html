<p>All payroll items set up for the employee that are not part of standard  earnings are displayed in the Additional earnings and deductions grid.</p>

<p><strong>Base</strong></p>

<p>If the payroll item is calculated as a percentage or by multiplying  a number of units by rate, then this field is enabled. You are required  to specify the base amount (if calculated as a percentage) or the number  of units (if calculated on a rate basis). This option is disabled, if  the payroll item is not calculated as a percentage or on a rate basis.</p>

<p class="example">Sales commission is calculated as a percentage  of sales. The base amount in this case would be the sales amount. Mileage  reimbursement is calculated by multiplying the number of miles traveled  in the pay period with the rate.</p>
