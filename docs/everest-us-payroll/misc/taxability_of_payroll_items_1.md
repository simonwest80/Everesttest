# Taxability of Payroll Items


All payroll items are not taxed uniformly. The payroll item taxability  identifies the taxes that are payable on the payroll item. You will have  to specify the taxes applicable to each payroll item.


Amounts for payroll items of type addition or company contribution that  are not taxable are not added to the taxable wage base for computing the  tax.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the company contribution  to a 401K plan is not taxable to federal income tax, and an employee earns  $5000 as salary and the company contributes $150 towards a 401 K  plan, then the federal income tax is calculated on $5000 only.


A deduction that is not taxable will result in a reduction in taxable  wage base for the tax.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Salary  of an employee is taxable as per Federal Income tax but an employee's  contribution to a 401 K  plan is not taxed. In this case, if an employee earns $4000 as salary  and makes a contribution of $500, then Federal Income tax would be calculated  on $3500. In effect, the employee gets a tax rebate on the deduction.


The taxability of a payroll item could differ at the employee level,  if the employee's filing state and local taxes differ from the state and  the taxes defined in the **Employee Template**.
