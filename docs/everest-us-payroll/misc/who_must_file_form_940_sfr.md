# Who must file Form 940?


If you answer **Yes** to either  one of these questions, you must file Form 940:

- Did you pay wages  of $1,500 or more to employees in any calendar quarter during 2007?
- Did you have one  or more employees for at least some part of a day in any 20 or more different  weeks in 2007? Count all full-time, part-time, and temporary employees.  However, if your business is a partnership, do not count its partners.



If your business was sold or transferred during the year, each employer  who answered **Yes** to at least one  question above must file Form 940. However, do not include any wages paid  by the predecessor employer on your Form 940 unless you are a successor  employer.


If you received a preprinted Form 940 and are not liable for FUTA tax  for 2007 because you made no payments to employees in 2007, check box  c in the top right corner of the form. Then go to Part 7, sign the form,  and file it with the IRS.


If you will not be liable for filing Form 940 in the future because  your business has closed or because you stopped paying wages, check box  d in the top right corner of the form.


For employers of household employees


If you are a household employer, you must pay FUTA tax on wages that  you paid to your household employees only if you paid cash wages of $1,000  or more in any calendar quarter in 2006 or 2007.


A household employee performs household work in a:

- Private home,
- Local college club,  or
- Local chapter of  a college fraternity or sorority.



Generally, employers of household employees must file Schedule H (Form  1040), Household Employment Taxes, instead of Form 940.


However, if you have other employees in addition to household employees,  you can choose to include the FUTA taxes for your household employees  on Form 940 instead of filing Schedule H (Form 1040). If you choose to  include household employees on your Form 940, you must also file Form  941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, Form 943, Employer's Annual  Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees, or Form 944, Employer's  ANNUAL Federal Tax Return, to report social security, Medicare, and withheld  federal income taxes for your household employees.


For agricultural employers


File Form 940 if you answer **Yes**  to either of these questions:

- Did you pay cash  wages of $20,000 or more to farm workers during any calendar quarter in  2007?
- Did you employ  10 or more farmworkers during some part of the day (whether or not at  the same time) during any 20 or more different weeks in 2007?



To answer these questions, count the wages you paid to aliens who were  admitted to the United States temporarily to perform farmwork (these workers  are also known as workers with H-2(A) visas). However, wages paid to “H-2(A)  visa workers” are not subject to FUTA tax.


For Indian tribal governments


Services rendered to a federally recognized Indian tribal government  employer (including any subdivision, subsidiary, or wholly owned business  enterprise) after December 20, 2000, are exempt from FUTA tax and no Form  940 for 2007 is required. However, the tribe must have participated in  the state unemployment system for the full year and be in compliance with  applicable state unemployment law. For more information, see section 3309(d).


For tax-exempt organizations


Religious, educational, scientific, charitable, and other organizations  described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a)  are not subject to FUTA tax and do not have to file Form 940.


For employers of state and local government employees


Employers of state and local government employees are not subject to  FUTA tax and do not have to file Form 940.
