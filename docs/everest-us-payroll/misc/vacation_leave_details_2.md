# Vacation Leave Details


When you set up **Everest US Payroll**, you have to enter the vacation and sick leave details. But once you process payroll, all the fields belonging to **Vacation leave details** and **Sick leave details** will get updated automatically. You need not specify leave details every year.


Employees are normally allowed a specified number of hours towards vacation leave. Details relating to the vacation leave allowed to an employee and the vacation leave balance may be specified in this section.


Vacation leave details have been grouped into the following sections:

- [Total Vacation Hours and Hours Used]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/total_vacation_hours_and_hours_used.html)
- [Max Balance and Reset Vacation]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/max_balance_and_reset_vacation.html)
