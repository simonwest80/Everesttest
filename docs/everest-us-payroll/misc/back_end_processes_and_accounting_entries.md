# Back End Processes and Accounting Entries


Following are the back end processes for a historical transaction:

- Historical  transactions are presumed to have been posted and paid.
- A new regular  transaction cannot be created using the **Everest 
 US Payroll** for the same period as a historical transaction. You  may create a supplemental transaction if no supplemental transaction exists  for the same period.


## Accounting Entries


No accounting entries are made for historical transactions.
