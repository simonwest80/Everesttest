<p><strong>Vacation Pay</strong> - This is paid  for vacation leave availed by the employee in the pay period. Vacation  Pay is calculated for the number of vacation hours that the employee is  eligible to receive payment for. It is a part of the employee’s standard  earnings.</p>

<p><strong>Additions to Paycheck</strong> - They  are the payroll items other than salary, regular pay, overtime, sick pay  and vacation pay that are added to the employee’s paycheck.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> ‘Sales  Commission’  and ‘Mileage Reimbursement’  are items that are added to an employee’s paycheck.</p>

<p><strong>Company Paid Expenses</strong> - They  are the fringe benefits that the company provides to employees.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> Company car is an item of fringe benefit.</p>

<p>Fringe benefits are not added to an employee’s paycheck but their value  has to be considered for tax computations.</p>

<p><strong>Third-party Payments</strong> - A third-party  payment is an item paid by a third party to an employee for which the  employer is responsible for calculating and withholding the tax.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> Tips or gratuity paid by a customer to an employee is  a third-party payment.</p>

<p>These do not result in an expense to the employer but the employer is  responsible for computing and withholding tax on the value reported by  the employee. Under the current federal tax laws, employees are required  to report tips greater than $20 in a pay period to their employers.</p>
