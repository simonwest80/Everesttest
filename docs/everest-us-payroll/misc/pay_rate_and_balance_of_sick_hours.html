  <dt><strong>Sick Pay Rate</strong></dt>
  <dd>This denotes the rate at which the employee is paid  for sick hours utilized. When payroll is processed for the employee, US  Payroll will calculate the sick pay by multiplying the rate entered here  with the sick hours entered in the <strong>Payroll</strong> Transactions profile (path: <strong>Payroll 
 &gt; Processing &gt; Payroll Transactions</strong> &gt; from the <strong>Payroll 
 Transactions</strong> browser, double-click the required record).</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">If you enter an amount greater than 0 in this  field, you must also add a payroll item of the type sick pay in the <strong>Pay Details</strong> tab of the <strong>Employee</strong>  profile.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Balance of Sick Hours</strong></dt>
  <dd>Balance of sick hours is the current balance of  sick hours in the employee’s sick leave account.</dd>
  <dd>When you set up US Payroll, you have to specify  the sick leave details. But once you process payroll, these fields get  updated automatically.</dd>
