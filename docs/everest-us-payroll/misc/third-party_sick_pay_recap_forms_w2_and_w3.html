<p>The third party must prepare a Third-party Sick Pay Recap Form W2 and  a Third-party Sick Pay Recap Form W3. These forms, previously called Dummy  forms, do not reflect sick pay paid to individual employees; instead,  they show the combined amount of sick pay paid to all employees of all  the clients of the third party. The recap forms provide a means of reconciling  the wages shown on the third party’s Form 941.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/warning.gif" alt="" /> Do not file the recap Forms W2 and W3 electronically  or on the magnetic media.</p>

<p>The third party fills out the Third Party Sick Pay Form W2 as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Box 
 b</strong> - Third party’s personal identification number.</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 c</strong> - Third party’s name and address.</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 e</strong> - Third party sick pay recap instead of the employee’s name</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 1</strong> - Total sick pay paid to all the employees</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 2</strong> - Any federal income tax withheld from the sick pay</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 3</strong> - Sick pay subject to Employee Social Security tax</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 4</strong> - Employee Social Security tax withheld from sick pay</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 5</strong> - Sick pay subject to Employee Medicare tax</li>
  <li><strong>Box 
 6</strong> - Employee Medicare tax withheld from sick pay</li>
</ul>

<p>The third party attaches the Third-party Sick Pay Recap Form W2 to</p>

<p>a separate recap Form W3 on which only boxes b, e, f, g, 1, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6 and 13 are completed. Enter Third Party Sick Pay Recap in box 13.  Box 14 is filled only by the employer.</p>
