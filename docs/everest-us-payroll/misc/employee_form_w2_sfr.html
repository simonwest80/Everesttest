<p>This field displays the total amount of social security tax withheld,  including social security tax on tips, from the employee’s pay. Hence  this box is calculated as the sum of the total social security tax withheld  from the employee’s paycheck throughout the year.</p>

<p>The maximum value that can be displayed in this field is obtained by  applying the following formula:</p>

<p>Social security wage base limit for the year * Tax rate for the year</p>

<p class="example"><strong>The Social security wage base limit for 2009  is $106,800 and the tax rate for the year is 6.2%; hence, the maximum  value this box can display is $ 106,800 * 6.2% = $ 6,021.60</strong></p>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<p>Certain employers must allocate tips if the percentage of tips reported  by employees falls below a required minimum percentage of gross sales.  To “allocate tips” means to assign an additional amount as tips  to each employee whose reported tips are below the required percentage.  For additional information on how the rules for tip allocation work, refer  to Chapter 7 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax. All tips you  receive are taxable. You should keep a record of actual tips received.  You can order Publication 1244, Employee’s Daily Record of Tips and Report  to Employer, for this purpose. If you do not have adequate records for  your actual tips, you must include the allocated tips shown on your Form  W-2 as additional tip income on your return. You must also complete and  attach Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tips.  For more information on the requirements, refer to Tip Allocation in Publication  531, Reporting Tip Income. Refer to Tax Topic 402, Tips, for other important  information.</p>

<p><strong>**Question:</strong>  If the reported tips from employees are more than 8% of sales, must an  employer still allocate tips to the employees?**</p>

<p>No. Employers who operate “large food or beverage establishments”  must allocate tips among the employees who receive tips only if the reported  tips are less than 8% of the gross receipts from sales for that establishment  for a given period.</p>

<p><strong>**Question:</strong>  My employer included allocated tips on my W-2 in box 1. The allocated  tips included were higher than the tips I actually received. Do I have  to pay taxes on money I never received?**</p>

<p>Allocated tips are reported in box 8 of Form W-2 and should <strong>not 
 be</strong> included in the amount in box 1. If they have been included  in box 1, you need to get a corrected Form W-2 from your employer.</p>

<p>By including the tip amount in box 1, the employer has indicated that  this is the tip amount you reported monthly and that Social Security tax  and Medicare taxes have been withheld (unless an amount indicating otherwise  appears in box 12). Your copies of your monthly tip reports and your daily  tip log will enable you to document that you reported a different tip  amount if the Form W-2 income continues to be disputed. If you do not  receive a corrected Form W-2, enter the amount of wages and tips you believe  to be correct on line 7 of Form 1040. Keep your tip records to support  the amount you reported.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>You normally must report allocated tips (box 8, Form W-2) as income  on line 7 of your Form 1040 unless you have a daily tip record documenting  that you actually received less tips than the amount allocated to you.  If you have adequate documentation of your actual tip amount, include  only the amount of tips that were actually received and reported to your  employer. This additional amount of tip income, whether it is allocated  tips or unreported tips, has not had income tax, social security tax or  Medicare taxes withheld. To correct this, the tips should also be entered  on Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare  Tax on Unreported Tips. Enter the tax from Form 4137 on line 56  of Form 1040 and attach Form 4137 to your return.</dt>

See Non-qualified deferred compensation plans on page 6. If  section 409A requires an amount to be included in gross income, the section  imposes a substantial additional tax. Section 409A, generally, is effective  with respect to amounts deferred in tax year beginning after December  31, 2004, but deferrals made prior to that year may be subject to section  409A under some circumstances. The Act requires reporting of the yearly  deferrals (plus earnings) under a section 409A non-qualified deferred  compensation plan, using Code Y in box 12. All 2005 deferrals (plus earnings)  must be reported on a Form W-2 (Box 12, Code Y) or Form 1099-MISC (Box  15a), even if the amounts are not yet taxable. Amounts that become taxable  because of noncompliance with 409A also must be reported. Income included  under section 409A from a non-qualified deferred compensation plan will  be reported in box 1, and in box 12 using Code Z. This income is also  subject to an additional tax reported on Form 1040. For more information,  see section 5 of Pub. 15-A.</li>
