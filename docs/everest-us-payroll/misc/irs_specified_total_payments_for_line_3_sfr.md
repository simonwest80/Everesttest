# IRS specified total payments for Line 3.


Report the total payments you made during the calendar year on line  3. Include payments for the services of all employees, even if the payments  are not taxable for FUTA.

You may have paid wages for piecework or as a percentage of  profits. Include:

- **Compensation, 
 such as:**


- Salaries, wages,  commissions, fees, bonuses, vacation allowances, and the amount you paid  to full-time, part-time, or temporary employees.


- **Fringe 
 benefits, such as:**
- Sick pay (including  third-party sick pay if liability is transferred to the employer).
- The value of  goods, lodging, food, clothing, and non-cash fringe benefits.
- Section 125  (cafeteria) plan benefits.
- **Retirement/Pension, 
 such as:**
- Employer contributions  to a 401(k) plan, payments to an Archer MSA, payments under adoption assistance  programs, and contributions to SIMPLE retirement accounts (including elective  salary reduction contributions).
- Amounts deferred  under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.
- **Other 
 payments, such as:**
- Tips of $20  or more in a month that your employees reported to you.
- Payments made  by a predecessor employer to the employees of a business you acquired.
- Payments to  nonemployees who are treated as your employees by the state unemployment  tax agency.
