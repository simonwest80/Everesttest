# Code and Pay Date


**Employee ID**
: This field denotes the employee for whom you are  setting up the payroll transaction history. This is a mandatory field.


**Pay Date**
: The **Pay Date**  is the payday of the transaction. When you consolidate historical transactions,  then you can specify the pay date for the last transaction.


**Start Date and End Date**
: The Start Date and End Date of the transaction denote  the payroll period for which the historical transaction is being created.  The Start Date of the transaction means the start date of the payroll  processing for an employee in the current year.


{:.example}
If an employee has joined on 01/01/2006, the  employee should receive payment from 01/01/2006 to 01/31/2006 in the case  of monthly pay periods. Here, the start date of the payroll processing  is 01/01/2006. For the next payroll processing, the start date will be  02/01/2006.


{:.note}
You cannot create a historical transaction  after processing the payroll, **** if  the historical payroll period specified comes after a payroll run.


If you consolidate transactions, you must enter the start date of the  first transaction and the end date of the last transaction in these fields.


If the Start Date or End Date you specified falls on or after the Start  Date of the payroll processing, you will not be able to save the record.  You will see an error message.


{:.example}
Assume June 20, 2006 is the start date of  the payroll processing. You will not be able to save the record, if the  start date or end date you specified in the **Employee 
 History** dialog box falls on or after June 20, 2006.
