# Regular Pay


**Regular Hours**
: The regular hours that an employee must work in  the payroll period is displayed by default. You should specify the actual  number of regular hours worked by the employee, if it differs from the  regular hours that an employee must work in the payroll period.


**Regular Pay Amount**
: This field displays the amount of regular pay for  the employee and is applicable to employees paid by hour. Where the employee  is paid by hour, the number of regular hours multiplied by the regular  hourly rate for the employee gives the regular pay for that employee.


**Overtime Hours**
: This field denotes the number of hours that the  employee has worked overtime during the specified pay period. Where the  employee is paid by hour, the number of overtime hours multiplied by the  overtime hourly rate specified in the **Employee**  profile gives the overtime pay for that employee.
