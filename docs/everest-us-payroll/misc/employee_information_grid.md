 Payment Wizard**.


Select the transactions for which you want to make payments by clicking  the respective check boxes in the grid.


{:.note}
Transactions with take-home pay as zero are not displayed in this grid.

- Click **Finish**. You will see the **Payroll 
 Payments** browser displaying all the transaction records selected  for payment.
- To complete  the process of paying employees, from the **Payroll 
 Payments** browser, choose the records you want and then select **Options &gt; Save**.



{:.note}
You need to select at least one transaction record to make the payment.  If you do not select any transaction listed in the **Payroll 
 Payments** browser, you will see an error message.


Before making the payment, you also have to specify whether you want  to generate a computer check by selecting the **Computer 
 Check** option in the transactions grid. To make a manual payment,  you need to enter the reference number in the **Check 
 #** column. You can also specify the check date in the **Check 
 Date** column.


When you click on **Save**, payment  journals are created. A new payment journal is created, if you have opted  for it in the **Payment Information - Payment 
 Journal** section of the wizard. The payment journals can be viewed  in the **Unposted** **Payment 
 Journals** browser (path: **Accounting 
 &gt; Account Payable &gt; Payment Journal**).
