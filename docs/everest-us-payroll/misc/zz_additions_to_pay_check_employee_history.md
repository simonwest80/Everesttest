title: Additions to Pay Check
---


If the Employee profile specifies a payroll item of the type “**Additions**” and pay type “**Addition 
 to** **Paycheck**”, **Everest 
 US Payroll** automatically calculates and displays the total in this  field. You cannot modify this field if it is automatically calculated.  If necessary, you can change this amount in the Additional Earnings and  Deductions section. If the Employee profile does not specify other additions,  you can enter the amount of paycheck additions in this field.
