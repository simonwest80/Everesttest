<p>The taxable amount of medicare wages is displayed. You can modify this  field. The wages and tips subject to Medicare tax are the same as those  subject to Social Security tax (boxes 3 and 7) except that there is no  wage base limit for Medicare tax.</p>

<p>Enter the total Medicare wages and tips in box 5. Be sure to enter tips  that the employee reported even if you did not have enough employee funds  to collect the Medicare tax for those tips. See Box 3 above for payments  to report in this box, if you paid your employee’s share of taxes.</p>

<p class="example"><strong>**Example of 
 how to report social security and Medicare wages</strong>:**</p>

<p><strong>You paid your employee $140,000 in wages.  Enter 106,800.00 in box 3 (social security wages), but enter 140,000.00  in box 5 (Medicare wages and tips). There is no limit on the amount reported  in box 5.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If the amount of wages paid was $106,800.00  or less, the amounts entered in boxes 3 and 5 would be the same.</strong></p>
