The employees' share (one-half) of the amount shown in column 2 of lines  5a, 5b, and 5c may differ slightly from the amount actually withheld from  the paychecks of employees due to the rounding off of social security  and Medicare taxes based on statutory rates. This discrepancy can be corrected  in this field by making adjustments to the fractions of cents.


Apart from the adjustment entered, if there is a difference between  the total tax liability for monthly or semi weekly schedule depositors  and LINE 10 of Form 941, a message is displayed to confirm if the difference  needs to be adjusted in Line 7a.


If you click the **OK** button in  the error message, **Everest** calculates  the difference and adds it to the existing adjustment on this line.


**![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You have  entered $100.00 as the adjustment in Line 7a. At the time of saving Form  941, if there is a difference of $250.00 between Line 10 and the total  of monthly schedule depositor and you want **Everest**  to adjust the difference, Line 7a displays $350.00.**

Enter the adjustment for the employee share of social security and Medicare  taxes that were withheld by your third-party sick pay payer.

Enter the amount to make adjustments to the following:

- Any uncollected  employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on tips
- The uncollected  employee share of social security and Medicare taxes on group-term life  insurance premiums paid for former employees



Use lines 7a,7b, and 7c only to report the current quarter adjustments;  to adjust any amount previously reported on lines 7a-7c, use line 7e and  attach Form 941c or an equivalent statement with an explanation.

Enter adjustments for the current year's income tax withholding.


**![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the  total amount of income tax actually withheld was not reported correctly  on Form 941 because of a mathematical or transposition error, the difference  can be adjusted here.**


![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/warning.gif) Do not  adjust income tax withholding for any quarter in previous years except  for correcting an administrative error. Remember to attach an explanation  for the adjustment.

Enter adjustments for social security and Medicare taxes for previous  quarters.


**![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If you  made a mistake when reporting social security and Medicare taxes on previously  filed Forms 941, adjust it here. If you need to report both an underpayment  and an overpayment, show only the net difference.**

**8. Total Taxes After Adjustments**
: This line displays the sum of the amounts shown  on lines 6 and 7h.


**9. Advance Earned Income Credit (EIC) Payments  Made to Employees**
: In this line, enter the amount of the advance earned  income credit (EIC) payments that you made to your employees. Eligible  employees may choose to receive part of the EIC as an advance payment.  Once the employee gives you a signed and completed Form W-5 you must make  the advance EIC payments starting with the employee's next wage payment.  Advance EIC payments are generally made from withheld income tax and social  security and Medicare taxes pertaining to both employee and employer.
: If the amount of your advance EIC payments is more  than your total taxes after adjustments (line 8) for the quarter, you  may claim a refund of the overpayment or elect to have the credit applied  to your return for the next quarter. Attach a statement to your Form 941  identifying the amount of excess payments and the relevant pay periods.
: By default, this line displays the sum of the EIC  amount specified in the **Transaction**  profile (path: **Accounting &gt; US Payroll 
 &gt; Processing &gt; Payroll Transaction &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window 
 &gt; General** tab **&gt; EIC Amount**)  of all employees who have been paid during the reporting quarter.


**10. Total Taxes After Adjustment for Advance  EIC**
: This line indicates the Â actual  taxes that need to be paid to the IRS/SSA after deducting the advance  EIC payments made to eligible employees. Subtract line 9 from line 8 to  arrive at this figure.

- If line 10  is less than $2,500, you may pay the full amount with a timely filed return  because you were not required to deposit. See section 11 of Pub. 15 (Circular  E) for information and rules about federal tax deposits.
- If line 10  is $2,500 or more for the quarter, you must deposit your tax liabilities  by using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or at an authorized  financial institution with Form 8109.

: ![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) The  amount shown on line 10 must equal the "Total" shown on Form  941, line 15 or the "Total liability for the quarter" shown  on Schedule B (Form 941).


**11. Total Deposits for This Quarter**
: In this line, enter your deposits for this quarter,  including any liabilities for a prior period resulting from adjustments  on line 7. Also, include any overpayment from a previous period that you  applied to this return.


**12. Balance Due**
: This line indicates the quarterly Federal tax amount  due from the employer to the IRS/SSA after considering the total deposits  made. The system automatically subtracts line 11 from line 10 to arrive  at this figure.

- Generally,  you should have a balance due only if your total taxes after adjustment  for advance EIC for the quarter (line 10) are less than $2,500. (However,  see section 11 of Pub. 15 (Circular E) for information about payments  made under the accuracy of deposits rule.)
- You may pay  the amount shown on line 12 using EFTPS or credit card. **Do 
 not** use a credit card to pay taxes that were required to be deposited.  For more information on paying your taxes with a credit card, visit the  IRS website at [www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov) and type "e-pay"  in the **Search** box.
- If you pay  by EFTPS or credit card, file your return using the "Without a payment"  address on page 4 under "Where should you file?" and do not  file Form 941-V, Payment Voucher.
- If line 10  is $2,500 or more and you have deposited all taxes when due, line 12 ("Balance  due") should be zero.

: ![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/warning.gif)**Caution**:  If you do not deposit as required and, instead, pay the taxes with Form  941, you may be subject to a penalty.


**13.Overpayment**
: This line displays an amount if the total deposits  made for that quarter exceed the total taxes after adjustment for EIC.
: If you deposited more than the correct amount for  a quarter, you can choose to have the overpayment refunded or applied  to your next return. Check the appropriate box in line 13. If you do not  check either box, the overpayment is automatically refunded. Your overpayment  may be applied to any past due tax account shown under your EIN. If line  13 is under $1, the overpayment is refunded or applied to your next return  only if you ask for it to be done in writing.
: ![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) If line 11 is more than line 10,  the amount is displayed in line 13.
