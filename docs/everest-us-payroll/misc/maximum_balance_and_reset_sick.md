# Maximum Balance and Reset Sick - Details


**Maximum balance of sick hours**
: Many companies have a policy of not accruing sick hours in an employee's account beyond a specified limit. If your company has such a policy, you will have to specify the maximum balance of sick hours that an employee can have in his account.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If the maximum balance of sick hours is 160, and an employee has 156 hours in his leave balance, the next credit to the employee's leave account cannot exceed 4 unless the employee utilizes some of the balance.


**Reset sick every new year**
: A few companies have a policy of not carrying forward sick leave balance to the next year. If you select this option, all sick leave balances are reset to zero at the beginning of the calendar year. Any unutilized balance at the end of a calendar year will lapse.
