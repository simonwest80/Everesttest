<p>Enter adjustments for the current year’s income tax withholding.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="" /> If the  total amount of income tax actually withheld was not reported correctly  on Form 941 because of a mathematical or transposition error, the difference  can be adjusted here.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/warning.gif" alt="" /> Do not  adjust income tax withholding for quarters in previous years unless you  do it to correct an administrative error. Remember to attach an explanation  for the adjustment.</p>
