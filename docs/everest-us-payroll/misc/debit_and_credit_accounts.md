# Debit and Credit Accounts


**Debit Account Code**
: The **Debit Account 
 Code** is the account to which the amount for the item has to be  debited.  For  all items of addition (except Third Party Payments and Company Paid Expenses),  accruals and company contributions, asset, expense and liability accounts  are available for selection. Third party payments are not expenses to  the employer. Company paid expenses are accounted through other expense  accounts and not through payroll accounts.


{:.example}
‘Sales Commission’  may be allocated to a cost center called ‘Sales Expense’.


**Location/Sub-Location**
: The Location/Sub-Location is the location/sub-location  or cost center for the item.
