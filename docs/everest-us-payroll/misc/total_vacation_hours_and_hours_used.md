# Total Vacation Hours and Hours Used


**Total Vacation Hours**
: Total vacation hours are the total number of vacation  hours that is credited to an employee in a calendar year. An employee's  leave account is credited with a proportionate amount of leave every pay  period.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  total vacation hours are 72 and an employee's pay period is monthly, the  employee is credited with 6 hours every pay period.


**Vacation Hours Used**
: This denotes the number of vacation hours availed  by an employee to date in the current calendar year. When you set up payroll,  this value should exclude hours utilized in the current pay period.


**![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the employee's pay  period is monthly and you are setting up **Everest US Payroll** in July, enter the vacation hours utilized in  the year up to June. When the payroll transaction is run for the month  of July, **** US Payroll will add the  hours utilized in July to this balance.**
