# Deductions


‘Deductions’ are the amounts that are deducted from an employee's pay.  The deduction could be a voluntary deduction or mandated by legal decrees.


{:.example}
Insurance premium is a voluntary deduction  whereas child support payments may be a deduction arising from a court's  decree.


‘Deductions’ result in a liability to the company. The amounts deducted  have to be remitted by the employer to the organization responsible for  its collection.


{:.example}
Insurance premium deducted is remitted to  the insurance company specified by the employee.
