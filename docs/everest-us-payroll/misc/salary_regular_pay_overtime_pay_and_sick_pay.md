**Regular Pay** - This is the payment  made to an employee for the hours of work that an employee is expected  to do in the pay period. Regular pay is calculated at a fixed rate for  the number of hours worked. Thus the amount of regular pay may vary based  on hours worked.

**Overtime Pay** - This is paid  for extra hours worked by an employee in the pay period. It is calculated  at a rate that normally exceeds the rate for regular pay. It is a part  of the employee's standard earnings.


**Sick Pay** - This is paid for  sick leave availed by the employee in the pay period. Sick pay is calculated  for the number of sick hours that the employee is eligible to receive  payment for. It is a part of the employee's standard earnings.


Sick pay is sometimes paid by a third party, such as insurance company  or an employee’s trust. In either case, this payment is generally subject  to Social Security, Medicare, and FUTA taxes. Sick pay becomes exempt  from these taxes six calendar months after the employee last worked for  the employer. These payments are also subject to Federal Income tax.
