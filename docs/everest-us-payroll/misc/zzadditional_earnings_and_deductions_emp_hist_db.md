title: Additional Earnings and Deductions
---


The additional earnings and deductions grid displays all payroll items  set up for the employee. Enter the base amount and amount for that earning  or deduction. If you have selected the **Supplemental**  option, then the only payroll items displayed are of the type 'additions'.


{:.example}
If the Employee profile specifies an amount  for a payroll item of the type “Additions” and pay type "Addition  to Paycheck", then this amount displays in the **Additions 
 to Paycheck** field. If the transaction is **Supplemental**,  the **Total Supplemental Earnings**,  **Net Pay** and **Gross 
 Pay** are increased.
