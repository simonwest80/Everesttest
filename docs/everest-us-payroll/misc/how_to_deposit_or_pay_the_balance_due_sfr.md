# How to deposit or pay the balance due?


You may deposit using EFTPS or an FTD coupon, or pay using a check,  money order, or major credit card.

- If you pay using  a check or money order, make it payable to “United States Treasury.” Be  sure to write your EIN, “Form 940,” and “2006” on your check or money  order. Complete Form 940-V, Payment Voucher, and enclose it with your  return.
- You may deposit  the amount shown on line 14 using EFTPS or an FTD coupon. If the balance  due is more than $500, you must deposit it.
- Call Link2Gov Corporation  (1-888-729-1040) or Official Payments Corporation (1-800-272-9829) to  make your payment by credit card. However, do not use a credit card to  pay taxes that are required to be deposited.  For  more information on paying your taxes, visit the IRS website at [www.irs.gov](http://www.irs.gov)



If you deposit using EFTPS or an FTD coupon, or pay using a credit card,  file your return using the **Without a 
 payment** address. Do not complete or file Form 940-V, Payment Voucher.
