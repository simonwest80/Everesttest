<p>Some payments are exempt from FUTA tax because the payments are not  included in the definition of wages or the services are not included in  the definition of employment. Payments exempt from FUTA tax may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fringe 
 benefits, such as:</strong></li>
  <li>The value of  certain meals and lodging.</li>
  <li>Contributions  to accident or health plans for employees, including certain employer  payments to a Health Savings Account or an Archer MSA.</li>
  <li>Employer reimbursements  (including payments to a third party) for qualified moving expenses, to  the extent that these expenses would otherwise be deductible by the employee.</li>
  <li>Payments for  benefits excluded under section 125 (cafeteria) plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Group 
 term life insurance -</strong> For information about group term life insurance  and other payments for fringe benefits that may be exempt from FUTA tax.</li>
  <li><strong>Retirement/Pension</strong>,  such as employer contributions to a qualified plan, including a SIMPLE  retirement account (other than elective salary reduction contributions)  and a 401(k) plan.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependent 
 care</strong>, such as payments (up to $5,000 per employee, $2,500 if married  filing separately) for a qualifying person’s care that allows your employees  to work and that would be excludable by the employee under section 129.</li>
  <li><strong>Other 
 payments</strong>, such as:</li>
  <li>All non-cash  payments and certain cash payments for agricultural labor, and all payments  to “H-2(A)” visa workers.</li>
  <li>Payments made  under a workers’ compensation law because of a work related injury or  sickness.</li>
  <li>Payments for  domestic services if you did not pay cash wages of $1,000 or more (for  all domestic employees) in any calendar quarter in 2007.</li>
