# State Taxes - Details


This section allows you to specify the filing state of most of your employees as well as the SUTA and SDI states. You can also specify the state employment taxes that you pay or withhold from the employees.


**Filing State**
: This is the state in which majority of your employees file their returns. Only the states for which you have specified the tax applicability in the **State Setup** profile are available for selection.


**SITA**
: This option denotes that you withhold income tax from the employees. This option is disabled, if the **Filing State** selected does not collect the state income tax.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If the **Filing State** selected is Alaska which does not collect income tax, then this option will be disabled automatically.
