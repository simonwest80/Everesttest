<p>US Payroll allows you to allocate payroll amounts to different accounts  at the employee level. Further, payroll amounts may be allocated to different  locations/sub-locations for each employee. This ensures that the payroll  amounts are allocated to appropriate cost centers or profit centers.</p>

<p>If the payroll item account is blank, the default expense or liability  account specified for the payroll item would be used. If an account is  selected and the location/sub-location is left blank, the account is not  allocated to any location/sub-location.</p>
