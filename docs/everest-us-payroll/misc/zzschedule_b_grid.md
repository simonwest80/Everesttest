Day


This column displays the days of the month.


Calculated Amount


The tax liability for each date when wages are paid is calculated by  **Everest** and displayed in this  column. You cannot edit this amount.


Adjustments


Enter the amount of under-reported or over-reported tax liability as  adjustments in the **Adjustments**  column. You can enter both positive and negative amounts in this column;  however, the figure should not exceed the amount displayed in the **Calculated Amount** column. Since an over-reported  liability has to be offset only against subsequent liabilities, the credit  adjustment amount cannot be more than the 'Calculated amount'.


{:.note}
Under-reported tax liability must be adjusted  against the date on which the error is discovered.


{:.example}
Tax liability for the quarter April-June 2003  was $15,000. However, the tax reported in Schedule B for that quarter  was only $ 13,000. If you notice this difference of $2000 on December  4th, 2003, report the same in the October-December quarter of 2003 against  the date December 4th.


{:.note}
To rectify an over-reported liability, adjust  the amount as a credit in subsequent liabilities until the amount is exhausted.


{:.example}
You pay wages on every alternate day of the  month: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and so on. On the 3rd of December, you  discover that you have over reported social security tax on a prior quarter  by $12,000. Break up the over-reported amount and adjust it against the  tax liabilities of three pay days: ($5000) on 3rd December, ($5000) on  5th December and ($2000) on 7th December.


Final Amount


The ‘Final Amount’  is calculated as a sum of the columns 'Calculated Amount' and 'Adjustments'.
