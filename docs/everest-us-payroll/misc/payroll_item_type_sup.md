**Add/Delete**

**Payroll Item Code**
: The payroll item code identifies the item to be  included in the employee’s pay. The field is activated when you click  the **Add** button. Only the items  of the type you specified in the **Payroll 
 Item Type** field are available for selection. They will not be available  for selection, if they have already been added to the grid. The same payroll  item cannot be part of the employee’s pay structure twice.
