  <dd>The <strong>Add</strong> and  <strong>Delete</strong> buttons are used to add  an item to the <strong>Payroll Items</strong> grid <em>**</em> or delete an item from the grid.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Payroll Item Code</strong></dt>
  <dd>The payroll item code identifies the item to be  included in the employee’s pay. The field is activated when you click  the <strong>Add</strong> button. Only the items  of the type you specified in the <strong>Payroll 
 Item Type</strong> field are available for selection. They will not be available  for selection, if they have already been added to the grid. The same payroll  item cannot be part of the employee’s pay structure twice.</dd>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/everest-us-payroll/img/example.gif" alt="example.gif" /> If you specify <strong>Accruals</strong> as the type of payroll item,  then Sick Accrual and Vacation Accrual are available for selection in  the <strong>Payroll Item Code</strong> field, if  they have not already been included in the employee’s pay package.</p>

<p class="note">If you enter an amount greater than 0 in the  Yearly Salary, Hourly Regular Rate, Hourly Overtime Rate, Hourly Sick  Rate, Hourly Vacation Rate, Sick Accrual Rate, or Vacation Accrual Rate  in the <strong>General</strong> tab, then you must  set up an item of type salary, regular pay, overtime pay, sick pay, vacation  pay, sick accrual or vacation accrual. You cannot set up more than one  item of these types.</p>
