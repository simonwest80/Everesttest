# Optional Rule for Form W2


You and the third party may choose to enter into a legally binding agreement  designating the third party to be your agent for the purpose of reporting  sick pay through Form W2. The agreement must specify what part of the  payments under the sick pay plan can be excluded from the gross income  of the employees; this part is attributed to the employees' contribution  to the sick pay plan.


If you enter into such an agreement, the third party prepares the actual  Form W2 and not the Third Party Sick Pay Recap Form W2 for each employee  who receives sick pay from the third party.


If this optional rule is used, the following would hold good:

- The third party  does not provide you with the sick pay statement.
- You (not the third  party) prepare the Third Party Sick Pay Recap Form W2.
