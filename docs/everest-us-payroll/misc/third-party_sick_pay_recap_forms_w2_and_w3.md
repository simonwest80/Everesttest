# Third-party Sick Pay Recap Forms W2 and W3


The third party must prepare a Third-party Sick Pay Recap Form W2 and  a Third-party Sick Pay Recap Form W3. These forms, previously called Dummy  forms, do not reflect sick pay paid to individual employees; instead,  they show the combined amount of sick pay paid to all employees of all  the clients of the third party. The recap forms provide a means of reconciling  the wages shown on the third party's Form 941.
