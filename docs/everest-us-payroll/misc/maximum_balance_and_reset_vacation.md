# Maximum Balance and Reset Vacation


**Maximum balance of vacation hours**
: Many companies have a policy of not accruing vacation hours in an employee's account beyond a specified limit. If your company has such a policy, you are required to specify the maximum balance of vacation hours that an employee can have in his account


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If the maximum balance of vacation hours is 160, and an employee has 156 hours in his leave balance, the next credit to the employee's leave account cannot exceed 4 unless the employee utilizes some of the balance.


**Reset vacation every new year**
: A few companies have a policy of not carrying forward the vacation leave balance to the next year. If you select this option, vacation leave balances are reset to zero at the beginning of every calendar year.
