<p>‘Accruals’ are the payroll expenses that have to be paid at a future  date and not in the current payroll period. The liability for these expenses  accrues until the time of payment.</p>

<p class="example">If your company provides retirement benefits  calculated at 15 days wages for every year in service, the amount of retirement  benefit accrues at the rate of 1.25 days wage for every month in service  until the employee retires<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">.</font></p>

<p>Although the liability for payment arises at a future date, accounting  standards and guidelines recommend that you make adequate provision for  the liability.</p>
