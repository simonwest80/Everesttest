# Sick Accrual


**Sick Accrual** - An employee is eligible to avail sick leave for a particular number of hours for every pay period that the employee works.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If an employee is paid semi-monthly and is eligible for 78 hours of sick leave a year, then 3 hours are added to the employee's sick leave balance every pay period.


The employee may utilize the sick hours at a future date but the sick hours are earned in the current pay period. The sick pay paid to the employee when the sick hours were utilized is an expense that belongs to the period in which they were earned and not the period in which they were utilized.


Most companies accrue liability for sick hours that are earned in the current pay period but may be availed at a future date. Payroll items set up for accruing the value of sick leave earned in a pay period are **Sick Accrual** type of items.


**Everest US Payroll** automatically calculates the number of sick hours earned by an employee in a pay period. The sick accrual item identifies the payroll item and the accounts that must be credited or debited with the value of the sick hours earned.
