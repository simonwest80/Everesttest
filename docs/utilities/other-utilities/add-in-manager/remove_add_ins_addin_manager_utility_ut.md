# Remove Add-Ins


You can completely remove an add-in from a workstation, if necessary.  This removes the add-in from the Add-In Manager list and it cannot be  enabled. If you need to use this add-in again in the future, it must be  reinstalled.


{:.steps}
To remove an add-in from the Add-In Manager  list, do the following:

- From the main menu  bar of the appropriate workstation, select **Utility**  > **Add-In** **Manager**.  You will see the **Add-In 
 Manager** dialog box.
- Select the add-in  to be removed from the list.
- Click the **Remove** button. The selected add-in is  removed from the list and the add-in configuration file extension is renamed  from ACF to BAK.
- Click the **Close** button to exit the **Add-In 
 Manager** utility.
