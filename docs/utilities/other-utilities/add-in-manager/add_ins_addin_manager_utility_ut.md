# Add-Ins


An **Add-In** is a supplemental  program that extends the functionality of the main **Everest**  application. Usually they are created by third-party programmers to better  satisfy the requirements of your business environment. **Everest**  browsers, documents and profiles can use add-ins.


{:.example}
A Chart add-in is added to the **Items**  browser which displays the top ten items when selected from the menu bar.  The following figure displays the location of the add-in on the toolbar.

In this example, when the user opens the **Items**  browser and clicks the **Chart FX Add-In**  icon on the toolbar, the add-in executes and a chart displays the top  ten items.
