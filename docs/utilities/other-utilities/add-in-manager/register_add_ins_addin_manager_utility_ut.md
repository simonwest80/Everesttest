# Register Add-Ins


Programmers create add-in configuration files that are added to **Everest**. These configuration files give  **Everest** necessary information  about the add-in such as where the add-in attaches to **Everest**,  where the add-in is located, and whether or not the add-in is enabled  by default. When you start **Everest**,  these add-in configuration files are validated by the system. **Everest**  then registers the add-in on the workstation. Add-ins must be installed  and registered on each workstation where they will be used.
