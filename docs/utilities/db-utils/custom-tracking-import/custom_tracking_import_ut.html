<p>Custom tracking allows you to configure methods for categorizing  items, customers, vendors and other records in ways that are unique to  your business.  It  is especially powerful for categorizing items.  Custom  tracking allows you to promote products on your website beyond the traditional  method such as category, brand and manufacturer.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of custom tracking groups  and choices you can define.  The  custom tracking import tool makes it easy to assign items and other records  to a specific tracking choice.</p>

<p><strong>Everest</strong> also provides  you with the analytical tools and reports to derive data, based on custom  tracking details.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Tracking Process</strong></p>

<p>The custom tracking process involves the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Creating 
 tracking groups</strong> - A tracking group defines the information that  is required. For instance, you can create a tracking group called, ‘How  did you hear about us?’ for customers.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identifying 
 choices</strong> - Within the group, choices are available for selection.  For example, you may create ‘Newspaper ad’, ‘TV ad’ and ‘Company website’  as choices for the group ‘How did you hear about us?’</li>
      <li><strong>Tagging 
 data</strong> - This can be done with the appropriate choice. For example,  when a customer is created, the sales representative can find out how  the customer heard about you and tag the response to the customer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Item Tracking</strong></p>

<p>Here are a few examples of how custom tracking can be used  to track items:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Showcasing 
 items on your Everest E- Commerce store</strong> - You can create a custom  tracking group called ‘Featured Items’ with the following choices: ‘Best  Sellers’, ‘On Sale’, and ‘New Arrivals’. The tracking group is displayed  on the storefront with links to each choice, and items tagged with these  choices.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Group 
 items for inventory control</strong> - Items can be classified as A, B and  C or High, Medium and Low based on the value or priority for inventory  control and analysis. You can create custom tracking groups such as ‘ABC  Analysis’ with choices A, B and C or ‘Item Priority’ with choices ‘High’,  ‘Medium’ and ‘Low’.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="example">You may need information on how the customers  heard about you, their geographic areas, their business size or the competitor’s  products that they were using before purchasing your products.</p>
