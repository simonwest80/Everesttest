<h1 id="importing-historical-documents">Importing Historical Documents</h1>

<p>Historical documents are those documents that were created before you  migrated to <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<p>In order to import historical documents, you need to first map the header  details and then the line item details of historical sales or purchase  documents. For this reason, two files are required for importing documents.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/example.gif" alt="" /> For  importing Historical Customer documents, the first file must contain header  details, which are mapped with the INVOICES table in <strong>Everest</strong>  database. Then the second file that contains the line item details is  mapped with the X_INVOIC  table. After the fields in the source tables are mapped with the fields  in the destination tables, the import process can be started.</p>

<p>After the header details are mapped with the destination table (INVOICES  table or PO table), <strong>Everest</strong> displays  the <strong>Source File Selection</strong> section  for line item details.</p>
