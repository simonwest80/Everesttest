Use the **Accounts Receivable**  import table to import the customer balance on the date of the trial balance  and open sales invoices/credit memos subsequent to the trial balance date  into **Everest**.


For each import row in the Accounts Receivable import table, an accounting  entry is made in the Sales Journal for the value of the Accounts Receivable.
