# Accounts Payable


Use the **Accounts Payable** import  table to import the vendor balance on the date of the trial balance and  open purchase invoices/debit memos subsequent to the trial balance date  into **Everest**.


For each import row in the Accounts Payable import table, an accounting  entry is made in the Purchase Journal for the value of the Accounts Payable  amounts that are imported.
