Options


The selections available in the **Options**  section depend upon the type of data selected. Be sure to review the selections  in the **Options** section before  continuing with the import process.


**Load Settings**
: You can load a .Map file that you saved previously  to save time. Click the **Load Settings**  button and select your map file. The file type and path information loads  along with the field map settings. The field map settings will appear  on the **Field Mapping** screen.


{:.example}
When you imported item categories previously,  on the **Field Mapping** screen, you  saved the field mappings in a map file. To save time importing other categories  into Everest, load the map file and the fields will be mapped automatically.
