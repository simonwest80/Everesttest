<p>Freight estimation in <strong>Everest</strong>  is not limited to the freight calculations based on weight or other options  available in the <strong>Zone</strong> and <strong>Rate</strong> profiles.</p>

<p>Extensive freight estimation is possible in <strong>Everest</strong>  by importing freight details from the respective carrier websites such  as UPS and FedEx. <strong>Everest</strong> calculates  the freight based on the zones and rates defined by these carriers.</p>

<p class="note">Download rate and zone files from your freight  carrier’s website. If you do not see them published there, contact your  Account Manager for the carrier (i.e. UPS or FedEx) to request the files  in .CSV or Excel format. You can import them into <strong>Everest</strong>  in the appropriate format.</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Data Import Wizard</strong> (path:  <strong>Utility</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong>  &gt; <strong>Data</strong>) to import the freight  rates and freight zones. The freight zones must be imported before the  freight rates since the rates are defined for the zones.</p>
