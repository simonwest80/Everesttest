# Matrix Items Import


**Everest** allows you  to import all your matrix items and create a matrix group with the **Everest** **Matrix 
 Item Import Wizard**. This feature is especially useful to import  a large number of matrix items at a time by importing an Excel (.xls/.csv)  file that lists all the matrix items.


Import matrix items when:

- You are implementing  **Everest** and have a large number  of items that must be configured as Matrix Groups in **Everest**.



{:.example}
You are an apparel company selling over 1000  styles of clothing. Â Each  style must be configured as a matrix group and includes over 7 different  variations such as Size and Color.

- Your vendor has  provided you with a file that has item code, description and price details  for a new line of products that you plan to carry.



{:.example}
You are preparing for the fall fashion season  by configuring 15 new styles of coats you are going to sell.
