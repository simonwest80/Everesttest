<p>The <strong>Purge</strong> utility allows you  to delete quotes, freight information and event log that are no longer  required from the database. When records are purged they are deleted permanently.</p>

<p>The records that you can delete permanently are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/misc/purge_sales_opportunities_utility_content.html">Sales  Opportunities</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/purge/purge_sales_quotes_utility_content.html">Sales  Quote</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/purge/purge_credit_quotes_utility_content.html">Credit  Quotes</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/purge/purge_purchase_quotes_utility_content.html">Purchase  Quotes</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/purge/purge_debit_quotes_utility_content.html">Debit  Quotes</a></li>
  <li><a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/purge/purge_freight_rates_utility_content.html">Freight  Rates</a></li>

</ul>

<p>: <img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/warning.gif" alt="" /> When a Freight Zone is purged, all  the associated Freight Zone Details and Freight Rates are also purged.</p>

<p>The sequence numbers of the purged quotes are deleted permanently. <strong>Everest</strong> does not re-assign these sequence  numbers to any other quotes. You can however use the purged sequence numbers  by inserting them in the <strong>Location</strong>  profile (path: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounting</strong>  &gt; <strong>Location</strong>/<strong>Sub-Location</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>In 
 New Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Invoicing</strong>/<strong>Purchasing</strong> tab).</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/example.gif" alt="" /> The  sales quotes numbered 1000 to 1050 are purged. <strong>Everest</strong>  will not re-assign these numbers to any other quotes. You can however  assign these numbers to other quotes from the <strong>Location</strong>  profile.</p>
