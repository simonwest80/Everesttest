<p>The <strong>Backup Company</strong> utility (path:  <strong>Utility</strong> <strong>&gt; 
 Database Maintenance &gt;</strong> <strong>Backup 
 Company</strong>) allows you to take a backup of the database of the company  that you have currently logged into. There can be instances when a database  crash occurs, resulting in the loss of valuable data. If a backup is taken,  it can be used in such cases so that important information is not permanently  lost.</p>

<p>Automatic Database Backup</p>

<p>You can set schedule options to ensure that the database backup is carried  out automatically at regular intervals.</p>

<p><img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/example.gif" alt="" /> You can backup data every day or once a week.</p>

<p class="note">Users can work with <strong>Everest</strong>  when the database backup is being carried out. Transactions in progress  (transactions that are being carried out simultaneously by users when  the database update is in progress) will not be backed-up.</p>

<p class="hint">In order to ensure backup of all the relevant  data up to a particular period and time, you could take backup when all  users have logged out of <strong>Everest</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu bar, select <strong>Utility</strong> &gt;  <strong>Database Maintenance &gt;</strong> <strong>Backup Company</strong>.
