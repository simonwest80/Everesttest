# Backup Information


The **Backup** section allows you  to select the type of database backup. You can opt to:

- backup the  entire database or,
- update the  data that has been added to the database from the date of the last backup.



**Database - complete**
: Select this option to take a backup of the entire  database of the company that you are currently logged into.


**Database - differential**
: Select this option to take a backup of only the  data that has been added to the database since the last backup.


{:.note}
You will be able to proceed with the **Database - differential** option only  if a complete backup of the database using **Database 
 - complete** option has been performed at least once. If a complete  backup has not been done, **Everest**  will prompt you to perform a complete backup first.
