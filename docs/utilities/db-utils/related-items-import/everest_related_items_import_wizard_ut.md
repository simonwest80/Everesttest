{:.note}
It is important that your import file is an  exact copy of the sample sheet named "sample" in the template.


{:.example}
You have five related items (Printer, Scanner,  DVD Writer, CD Writer, and Web Camera) for the parent item computer of  a particular model and you wish to import the related items. There are  25 models of the camera and each model has five related items. Create  an excel with the data and import the related items with the **Everest

contain only empty cells by selecting the  entire row and deleting it.
