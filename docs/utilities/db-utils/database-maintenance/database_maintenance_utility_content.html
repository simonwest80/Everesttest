<p><strong>Everest</strong> enables you to maintain  your database, thus ensuring optimum performance. This is achieved through  defragmentation and rebuilding of indices. When any data is saved, it  is stored on your hard disk, not always in a contiguous manner. This is  known as fragmentation. The data is scattered on the hard disk, making  it difficult for your computer to locate and retrieve it at an optimum  speed. Defragmentation is the process of locating the non contiguous fragments  of data, and rearranging the fragments into fewer fragments, or into the  whole file. Defragmentation reduces data access time and allows storage  to be used more efficiently.</p>

<p class="note">We recommend that you defragment indices periodically.  The time interval depends on the frequency of data changes in the tables.</p>

<p class="warn">Only a supervisor, or a user with equivalent  rights and knowledge about database maintenance should run the <strong>Defragment 
 Indexes</strong> utility.</p>
