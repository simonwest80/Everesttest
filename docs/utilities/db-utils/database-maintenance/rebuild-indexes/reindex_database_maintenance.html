<p>When a database is created, it is indexed on various fields to make  data retrieval easier and more efficient. Over a period of time, however,  these indices can lose their integrity or get corrupted, resulting in  errors. Re-indexing your data files optimizes your database and computer  performance. The re-indexing process rebuilds all the indices of all the  tables in the database, for the logged-in company.</p>

<p class="warn">Re-indexing of the database should be performed  when all users have logged out. Only a supervisor, or a user with equivalent  rights and knowledge should re-index the database.</p>

<p class="steps">To re-index your database, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the main  menu, select <strong>Utility &gt; Database Maintenance 
 &gt; Rebuild Indexes</strong>. You will see the <a href="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/db-utils/database-maintenance/rebuild-indexes/reindexing_dialog_box.html"><strong>Reindexing</strong></a>  dialog box.</li>
</ul>
