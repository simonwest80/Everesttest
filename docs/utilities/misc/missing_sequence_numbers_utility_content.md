# Missing Sequence Numbers


When you try to save a new document, profile or journal, **Everest**  assigns the current number in sequence (as specified in the **Location**  profile) and automatically generates the next sequence number.


If the system is unable to save the data for some reason; then the current  sequence number that has been assigned by **Everest**  to the new document, profile or journal is not used.


If the document is not saved, the sequence number assigned to it is  lost.


The next time the document, profile or journal is saved **Everest**  assigns the next sequence number.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  create a Purchase Quote that is assigned the number 1000, but are unable  to save due to a system failure. When you re-save the Purchase Quote a  new sequence number 1001 is assigned to it.
