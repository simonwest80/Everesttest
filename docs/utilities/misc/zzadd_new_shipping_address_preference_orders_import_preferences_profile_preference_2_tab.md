title: Create a new shipping address unless shipping address found with matching
---

- **Telephone-1**  – Select this option if you do not want to create a new shipping address  when the Telephone-1 field of the customer shipping address entered in  the online store matches the existing shipping address in the **Everest**  database. If this field is blank in both the imported shipping address  and in the existing shipping address in **Everest**,  a comparison is not possible and therefore the system creates a new shipping  address.
- **Street 
 Address and Telephone-1** – Select this option if you do not want  to create a new shipping address when the Street Address and Telephone-1  fields of the customer shipping address entered in the online store match  the existing shipping address in the **Everest**  database. If any one of these fields does not match, the system creates  a new shipping address.
If any of these fields are blank in both the imported shipping address  and in the existing shipping address in **Everest**,  the system considers these field values the same for this field and does  not create a new shipping address based on this field.
- **Street 
 Address, Zip and Telephone-1** – Select this option if you do not  want to create a new shipping address when the Street Address, Zip, and  Telephone-1 fields of the customer shipping address entered in the online  store match the existing shipping address in the **Everest**  database. If any one of these fields does not match, the system creates  a new shipping address.
If any of these fields are blank in both the imported shipping address  and in the existing shipping address in **Everest**,  the system considers these field values the same for this field and does  not create a new shipping address based on this field.



For all of the above options, fields match if they contain identical  values. A field with a value does not match a blank field.
