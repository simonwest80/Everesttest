title: Text Qualifier

Specify the field qualifier, to distinguish the data from the field,  where the file contains the delimiter as a part of the data.


{:.example}
**In comma-separated files, a comma may have  been inserted within the existing text of the source data file. The Text  Qualifier Double Quotes (" ") is used to identify an already  existing comma in the source data file.**


**The address data in the source file can be  formatted as given below:**


**House No., Street, City, State**


**In such an instance, double quotes will be  used to identify the fields, which are already using comma, in the source  file.**
