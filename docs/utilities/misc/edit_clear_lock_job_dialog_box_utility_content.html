<h1 id="edit-clear-lock-job-dialog-box">Edit Clear Lock Job dialog box</h1>

<p>When a user opens any master record (Item profile, Customer profile, etc.) or any transaction record (sales order, purchase order etc.) for modification, <strong>Everest</strong> locks that record so that another user cannot modify it at the same time. When the user closes the record, the lock is released.</p>

<p>A user cannot modify a locked record until the lock is released. If a user opens a record and the user is inactive for a long time, <strong>Everest</strong> is enabled to clear all locks set by inactive users. The time limit for treating a user as inactive is set in this dialog box.</p>

<p><strong>Occurs Every</strong></p>

<p>Enter the number of minutes/hours after which the locks can be cleared. Specify the unit of time (minutes or hours) using the field beside the <strong>Occurs</strong> <strong>Every</strong> field.</p>
