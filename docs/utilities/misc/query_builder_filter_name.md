# Filter Name


Specify a filter name for the query that you are creating. It is suggested  that you choose a name that most closely describes the query. You can  save the filter by clicking the ![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/utility_save_button.gif) icon and store it in  **Everest** for future use, which  means that you need not rewrite the query.
