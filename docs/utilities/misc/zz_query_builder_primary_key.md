Specify the primary key from the drop-down list. This drop-down list  displays only those fields that you have selected in the table(s) in the  **Custom Query Builder** section.


A primary key is a unique key using which the filter results are sorted  out. It does not allow **Null** values  and must always have a unique index. A primary key is used to relate a  table to foreign keys in other tables.
