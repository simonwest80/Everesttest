<p>Specify a filter name for the query that you are creating. It is suggested  that you choose a name that most closely describes the query. You can  save the filter by clicking the <img src="/versata-everest-docs/utilities/img/utility_save_button.gif" alt="" /> icon and store it in  <strong>Everest</strong> for future use, which  means that you need not rewrite the query.</p>
