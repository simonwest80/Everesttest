<h1 id="positive-tax-difference">Positive Tax Difference</h1>

<p>Positive Tax Difference implies that the tax calculated in <strong>Everest</strong>  is less than the tax calculated on the online store.</p>

<p>In such cases, the non-inventoried item specified in the <strong>Item 
 to be used for adjusting Positive Tax Difference</strong> field (<strong>Sales Order Import Preferences</strong> profile  &gt; <strong>General</strong> tab) is used to adjust  the positive tax difference and is included as a line item in the sales  document. A negative quantity is populated in the ‘<strong>Quantity</strong>’  column and the amount of difference is populated in the ‘<strong>Price</strong>’  column of the sales document.</p>

<p>The non-inventoried item specified here is not taxable and therefore,  you must create a special tax rule exempting the selected item and jurisdiction.  If a special tax rule does not exist for the item and jurisdiction (of  the sales order), <strong>Everest</strong> creates  a new special tax rule to account for the tax difference.</p>
