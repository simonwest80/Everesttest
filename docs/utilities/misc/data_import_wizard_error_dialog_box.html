<dl>
  <dt><strong>Skip erroneous records and continue with import</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this option to import only those records  that do not have errors to your database. The erroneous records are listed  in a text file called  DataImportErrorRecords.txt  in the <strong>Utilities</strong> folder where  <strong>Everest</strong> is installed.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Return to wizard to fix errors</strong></dt>
  <dd>Select this option to delete the imported records  and return to the wizard to fix issues, which have led to erroneous records  being imported.</dd>

  <dt><strong>View Error</strong></dt>
