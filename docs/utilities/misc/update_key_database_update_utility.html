<p>The <strong>Database Update</strong> Utility  is used to update the system and company databases. When you create a  company in <strong>Everest</strong>, a company  database which has all the details pertaining to that company is created  automatically. The system database contains common data required for the  smooth functioning of all the company databases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you install  a new version of <strong>Everest</strong>, the  default databases are updated. The system database and the company databases  are not updated. Thus, when the user tries to login into <strong>Everest</strong>  the next time, a mismatch between the default database and the company  or system database is detected.</li>
  <li><strong>Everest</strong>  displays a message and enquires  to proceed with the update  process.</li>
  <li><strong>Everest</strong>  then compares the databases and identifies if the company or system database  has to be updated.</li>
  <li>You will not be  able to login to <strong>Everest</strong> unless  you have updated the database.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Update key is required to enable the user to execute the <strong>Database 
 Update</strong> utility before the Update utility is run in case of version  mismatch. A single update key is required and this will update all activated  options for the company.</p>

<p>For US Payroll, the activation code will have the last date for which  transactions can be created. A new activation code is required to update  the company profile each time the company subscribes to an yearly payroll  update.</p>
