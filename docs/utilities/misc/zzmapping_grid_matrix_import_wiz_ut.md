title: Mapping Grid
---


The **Generic - Field map 
 (ITEMS)** section maps the fields to be imported (in the source table)  with the fields in the destination table. Fields that are not mapped in  the destination table can have a default value or auto incremented. Map  each field in the Source Table to the appropriate field in the Destination  Table. This is essentially mapping the details of your matrix items to  the fields of the matrix group to be created in this screen.


The Generic - Field map (ITEMS) screen of the Wizard contains  two panels:

- **Destination**  - The Destination panel displays the Column Name, Description, Type and  Size of the **Everest** data. The  Mandatory column indicates if a field is mandatory.
- **Source**  - The Source panel displays the data in the Source field. You will map  the fields of your matrix items in this column.
