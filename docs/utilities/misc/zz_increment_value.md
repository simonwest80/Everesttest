title: Increment Value
---


Specify the incremental value.


{:.note}
The start value has to be numeric. If the  prefix and suffix fields are numeric characters, only the Start value  will be incremented.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  1000 items must be serially numbered and the first serial number begins  with A0001, you can give 1 as the increment value and the serial numbers  will be generated as A0002, A0003 and so on.
