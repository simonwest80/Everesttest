# Update Price Differentials for Items


The **Update Price Differentials for 
 Items** option updates the price differentials for the selected items  with respect to changes in cost and selling price.


{:.steps}
To update the price differential for items,  do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Utility** > **Update** **Price****Differentials** **&gt; 
 Items**. You will see the **Update****Price** **Differentials****for** **Items**  browser.
- Select the  items that have to be updated.
- Select **Options** > **Process**.  The item prices are updated as specified in the **Related 
 Items** profile (path: **Inventory**  > **Items** > **Options**  > **Related Items**).

{:.note}
This process will update only those price  differences, which have been generated using a specific formula in the  **Related Items** profile. In case  of a flat price difference, the new price difference has to be updated  manually in the **Related Items**  profile.


{:.hint}
It is recommended that you update prices at  frequent intervals, as it will be difficult for you to keep track of the  cost and selling price changes and update them accordingly.
