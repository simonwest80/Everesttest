<h1 id="update-price-differentials">Update Price Differentials</h1>

<p>The difference between the price of an item and a related item has to be entered either as a fixed price, or can be arrived at by specifying a formula. The price difference is specified using the <strong>Item</strong> profile (path: <strong>Inventory</strong> &gt; <strong>Items</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Related Items</strong>).</p>

<p>If there is a change in the cost (average cost or last cost) or selling price of a related item, you will have to re-apply the formula so that the changed cost or selling price is considered when calculating a new price differential.</p>

<p>To simplify the process of updating the price differentials under such circumstances, the <strong>Update Price Differentials</strong> feature has been provided. This feature allows you to update the price difference for both items and kits.</p>
