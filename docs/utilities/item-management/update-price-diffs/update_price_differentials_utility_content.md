# Update Price Differentials


The difference between the price of an item and a related item has to be entered either as a fixed price, or can be arrived at by specifying a formula. The price difference is specified using the **Item** profile (path: **Inventory** > **Items** > **Options** > **Related Items**).

If there is a change in the cost (average cost or last cost) or selling price of a related item, you will have to re-apply the formula so that the changed cost or selling price is considered when calculating a new price differential.


To simplify the process of updating the price differentials under such circumstances, the **Update Price Differentials** feature has been provided. This feature allows you to update the price difference for both items and kits.
