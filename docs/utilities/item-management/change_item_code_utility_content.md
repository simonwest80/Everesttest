# Change Item Codes


You can replace your existing item codes with new item codes using the  **Change Item Code** utility.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you have given the item code as "StrawDispenser"  in **Everest** for the item Acrylic  Straw Dispenser and your vendor has a more industry accepted code - "ACDISPEN".  You can use the **Change Item Codes**  utility to change it.

To change the item code, do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Utility** > **Change Item Code**. You will see the **Change Item Code** dialog box.
