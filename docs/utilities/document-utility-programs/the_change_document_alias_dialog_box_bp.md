# The Change Document Alias Dialog Box


Use the Change Document Alias dialog box to set up the change from one  document alias to another.


**Document type**
: Select the document type of the alias you want to  change.


**Current document alias**
: Select the document alias you want to change. If  you selected a document type, this field displays only those aliases created  for the chosen type. Otherwise, this field shows all of the document aliases  you created for all document types.


**New document alias**
: Enter the document alias you want to use in place  of the one selected in the Current document alias field. You can enter  a maximum of 25 characters made up of numbers, capital and lowercase letters,  and the following characters:


| # | ; | \_ |
| - | , | > |
| : | / | < |

: All other characters are restricted.
: The following character combinations are reserved  for command line parameters with Microsoft Outlook and are not allowed  in the document alias when followed by a space.


| /a | /m | /t |
| /f | /p | /v |
| /i | /s | /x |



{:.example}
You cannot use the document alias "Sales/P  Order" because it contains "/P" followed by a space.
