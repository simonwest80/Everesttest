# Modify a Task


A **Task** can also be modified  from the following locations:

- From the **My Tasks** browser/**All 
 Tasks** browser (path: **Contact Manager**  > **My Tasks**/**All 
 Tasks**) by selecting **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** or by double-clicking the required task **** under the **Subject** column.
- From the **Calendar View** profile (path: **Contact 
 Manager** > **Calendar View**)  by selecting **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** from the right-click menu or by double-clicking the  required task **** under the **Subject** column.



{:.steps}
To modify a task from the Contact Manager,  do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Contact Manager &gt; 
 Calendar View**. You will see the **Calendar 
 View** profile.
- From the **Calendar View** profile, highlight a task  to be modified from the **Task Pad** and  select **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** from the right-click menu. You will see the **Task**  profile.
- From the **Task** profile make the modifications  and select **Save**.



If you create a task for multiple users, the system creates individual  tasks for each user. Since the tasks created become individual tasks,  they must be modified individually.
