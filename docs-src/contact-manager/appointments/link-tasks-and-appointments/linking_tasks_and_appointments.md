# Link Tasks and Appointments


Tasks and appointments can be linked in the **Task/Appointment**  profile. Linking tasks and appointments identifies interdependencies.  If the completion of one task depends on another, the task can be linked.  Linking also helps to plan a project that has more than one task.


{:.note}
A task also refers to Incoming call, Outgoing  Call and General Note.


Use any of the following combination to link a task or an appointment:


| Task | : | Task |
| Task | : | Appointment |
| Appointment | : | Appointment |
| Appointment | : | Task |



{:.steps}
To link a task or an appointment, do the  following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Contact Manager**  > **Calendar View**. You will see  the **Calendar View** profile.
- Highlight the  task/appointment you want to link to another task/appointment and select  **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** from the right-click menu. You will see the **Task/Appointment**  profile.
- From the **Task/Appointment** profile click **Set Link/s** ![]({{site.cm_baseurl}}/img/cm_set_links_icon.gif) icon. You  will see the **Set 
 Link/s** **for** <**Task/Appointment&gt;**  browser.
- From the **Set Link/s for &lt;Task/Appointment**>  browser select the tasks/appointments you want to link.
- Click **Enter** to link the selected tasks/appointments.



The **Set Link/s** feature sets  up inter-dependencies for tasks and appointments; it does not allow you  to modify tasks and appointments as a single entity.
