# Document Tracking Preferences


Document Tracking allows you to track the status of each document based  on the tracking groups that you have setup for that document type.


![]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  If  you want to track the approval status for purchase quotes, you can set  up a tracking group called ‘Quote Approvals’. Whenever a quote is created  or its approval status changes, you have to tag it with the appropriate  choice for the tracking group ‘Quote Approvals’ through the Custom Tracking  window.
