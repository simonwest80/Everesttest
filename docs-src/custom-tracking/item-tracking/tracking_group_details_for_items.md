# Tracking Group Details for Items


The **Custom Tracking Group - Items**  profile (path: **Custom Tracking Setup 
 - Inventory** browser **&gt; Options 
 &gt; New &gt; Group &gt; In New Window**) allows you to create a  custom tracking group for items.


General Information


This section gives you information related to the **General**  tab of the **Custom Tracking Group** profile.


**Group Code**
: Group code is the unique number assigned to the  custom tracking group. It is automatically generated when you save a new  custom tracking group.


**Description**
: The description identifies the tracking group.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Descriptions  can be self-explanatory like ‘Warranty period of items’


**Allow multiple selections to be tagged**
: Using this option, a particular record can be tagged  with more than one selection for the group.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  multiple selections are allowed for the tracking group 'Featured Items'  with choices ‘Exclusive Items’, ‘New Arrivals’ and ‘Season Special’  then an item can be tagged with more than one choice for the group.


**Force tag at least one selection**
: This option makes  tagging with at least one choice compulsory. This ensures that all records
: have relevant data.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  the tracking group for items ‘Featured items’ compels you to select at  least one choice  when a new item is created or when the profile  of an existing item is accessed after creating the tracking group, the  item profile cannot be closed without tagging the item with one of the  choices for the group ‘Featured items’.


**Refresh tag date if memo is updated**
: You can also give additional information for the  choice as notes. When an item is tagged with a choice, **Everest**  records the date of tagging. This option ensures that whenever you modify  the notes to the choice, the tag date gets updated with the date of modification.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  an item is tagged with the choice ‘Exclusive Items’ for the group 'Featured  Items' you can add a note to the choice that the preference is the items  featured.


**Security Description**
: This field denotes the security right for access  to the custom tracking group created. Only those users who  are assigned with this security right can tag any selection  belonging to this group.
