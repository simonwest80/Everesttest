# fPrompt for Save


The changes you make in the tracking are automatically saved while you  move from one tracking group to another. If you select this option (a  check mark appears beside the option to indicate that it is selected),  **Everest** prompts you to save the  changes you made to tracking when you move from one tracking group to  another.
