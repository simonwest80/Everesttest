# Upper Section - Custom Tracking List Dialog Box (Vendors)


Tracking groups and tracking selections are displayed in the upper section  of the dialog box. This section contains the **Include 
 List** and the **Exclude List** from  which you can select the required groups and choices.


**Include List**


This list enables you to include the tracking options you would like  to consider, in order to generate the vendor list. When you select custom  tracking choices in the **Include List**,  all vendors tagged with any of the choices selected are displayed in the  vendor list.


You can select the custom tracking choices in the **Include 
 List** by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.


Exclude List


This list allows you to generate the vendor list for vendors NOT tagged  with any of the choices selected. When you select custom tracking choices  in the **Include List** and **Exclude List**, all vendors tagged with  any of the choices selected in the **Include 
 List** and not tagged with any of the choices selected in the **Exclude List** are displayed in the vendor  list.


You can select the custom tracking choices in the **Exclude 
 List** by checking the box beside the choices listed below each group.
