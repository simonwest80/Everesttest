# Discontinue/Reactivate a Tracking Category for Vendors


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of tracking categories. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.
