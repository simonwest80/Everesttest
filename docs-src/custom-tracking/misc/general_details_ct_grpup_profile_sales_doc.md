**Allow multiple selections to be tagged**
: If a group allows multiple selections, a record  can be tagged with more than one selection for the group. **Everest**  warns you with a message **Disabling the 
 multiple tag option will not affect pre-existing selections. Are you sure 
 you want to change the setting?** if you have pre-existing selections  and want to uncheck the above option. Click **Yes**  if you do not want to allow multiple selections to be tagged to documents.


**Transfer tags across documents**
