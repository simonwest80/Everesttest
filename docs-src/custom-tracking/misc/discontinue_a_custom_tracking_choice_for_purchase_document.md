# Discontinue/Reactivate a Custom Tracking Choice for Purchase Document


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of custom tracking choices. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.
