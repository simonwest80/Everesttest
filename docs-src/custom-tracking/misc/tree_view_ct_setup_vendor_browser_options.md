# Tree View


The **Tree View** option allows  you to toggle between the 'normal view' and 'tree view' of the browser.  To get the tree view of the **Custom Tracking 
 Setup - Vendor** browser, select **Options 
 &gt; Tree View**. To revert to the normal browser view, select **Options &gt; Tree View**.


The tree view of the **Custom Tracking 
 Setup - Vendor** browser is divided into the following three sections:


**Tracking Category Section**
: This section allows you to create categories and  sub-categories for classifying tracking groups. Tracking categories help  you in organizing tracking groups better.


**Tracking Groups Section**
: This section displays a list of tracking groups  created for the selected tracking category. The tracking groups in the  selected tracking category are listed in order of rank.


**Tracking Choices Section**
: This section lists the available choices for the  tracking group selected. Custom tracking choices for the selected tracking  group are listed in order of rank.


Tracking Group/Choice Rank


The tracking group/choice rank is the order in which tracking choices  are listed when you access the particular custom tracking group.

 Groups/Choices** section.
