# Selection Criteria Details


This **Selection Criteria** dialog  box permits you to specify a date range before generating the vendor list.


**Tagged Date From/Tagged Date To**
: This option permits you to specify the dates between  which the vendors must are tagged with the relevant selections in the  Include and Exclude Lists. A record that is tagged outside this range  is not considered.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  a vendor is tagged with a selection in the Include List on April 15, 2001  and the date range specified is between March 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001,  the vendor will not figure in the list.
: Specifying a date range enables you to narrow down  the selection list.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Let  us assume that you want a list of vendors who are tagged within the past  week with the choice ‘Demo Requested’  in the group ‘Information Requests’. You can generate a list of them by  specifying the date range.


**User**
: This option allows you to view only those vendors  tagged by a specific user.
