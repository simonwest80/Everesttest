# Tree View


The **Tree View** option allows you to toggle between the 'normal view' and 'tree view' of the browser.


To get the tree view of the **Custom Tracking Setup - Inventory** browser, select **Options &gt; Tree View**. To revert to the normal browser view, select **Options &gt; Tree View**.


The tree view of the **Custom Tracking Setup - Inventory** browser is divided into the following three sections:

- [Tracking Category]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/misc/the_tracking_category_section.html)
- [Tracking Groups]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/misc/the_tracking_groups_section.html)
- [Tracking Choices]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/misc/the_tracking_choices_section.html)
