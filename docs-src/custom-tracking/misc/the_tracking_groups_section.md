# The Tracking Groups Section


This section displays a list of tracking groups created for the selected  tracking category. The tracking groups in the selected tracking category  are listed in order of rank.


The Tracking Group Rank


The tracking group rank is the order in which tracking groups are listed  when you access the **Custom Tracking Setup**  browser for an item. It also denotes the order in which tracking groups  are displayed on relevant pages on your **Everest 
 E-Commerce** store.


![]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â You  can reorganize the rank by moving the selected group using ![ct_up_arrow.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/ct_up_arrow.gif) and ![ct_note_icon.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/ct_note_icon.gif) arrows provided beside the **Tracking 
 Groups** section.
