# Using Customer Selection


You can use customer selection to execute the following:


**Sending mass e-mails** - You can  send bulk e-mails to the customers who have e-mail addresses specified  in their profiles, in the displayed list.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you have tracked customers based on hobbies, you can send in e-mails announcing  special sales of sports goods to all those customers whose hobby has been  tagged with ‘Sports’.


**Sending faxes** - You can send  faxes in bulk to customers who have fax numbers specified in their profile,  in the **Tracking Selections** list.


**Printing details** - You can print  details of the selected customers for further action.


A few examples of situations where the **Customer 
 Selection** can be effectively used are:

- Promotional  campaigns
- New  product announcements
- Sending  information on customer requests
- Requesting  current price lists
- News,  events and updates
