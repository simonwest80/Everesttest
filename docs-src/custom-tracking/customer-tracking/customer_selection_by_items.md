# Customer Selection by Items


The customer selection by items helps you obtain a list of customers  whose sales history includes or excludes the items selected in the **Customer Selection by Item** dialog box.


Include List


All items in the database are listed in the Include List grid with details  such as item code, description, total stock etc. You will have to select  the items in the Include List that a customer must have purchased from  you.


A customer is included in the generated list, if he has purchased at  least one of the items selected in the **Include****list**.


Exclude List

All customers who have purchased at least one of the items selected  in the **Include** **list**  and who have not purchased any item selected in the **Exclude****list** is displayed in the generated  list.
