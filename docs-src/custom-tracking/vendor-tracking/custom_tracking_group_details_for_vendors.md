# Custom Tracking Group Details for Vendors


The **Custom Tracking Group - Vendors**  profile (path: **Custom Tracking Setup 
 - Vendor** browser **&gt; Options 
 &gt; New &gt; Group &gt; In New Window**) allows you to create a  custom tracking group for vendors.


General Information


This section gives you details regarding the **General**  tab of the **Custom Tracking Group**  profile


**Group Code**
: Group code is the unique number assigned to the  custom tracking group. It is automatically generated when you save a new  custom tracking group.


**Description**
: The description identifies the tracking group. The  description must specify the information that is to be obtained.


![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Descriptions  can be self-explanatory like ‘Vendor classification’  or ‘Approval status’.


**Allow multiple selections to be tagged**
: Using this option, a particular record can be tagged  with more than one selection for the group.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  multiple selection is allowed for the tracking group 'Vendor Classification'  with choices ‘Legal’, ‘Accounting’ and ‘Insurance’, a vendor can be tagged  with more than one choice for the group.


**Force tag at least one selection**
: This option makes tagging with at least one choice  compulsory.
: ![example.gif]({{site.ct_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  the tracking group for vendors 'Vendor Classification' compels you to  select at least one choice  when a new vendor is created or when  the profile of an existing vendor is accessed after creating the tracking  group, the vendor profile cannot be closed without tagging the vendor  with one of the choices for the group 'Vendor Classification'. This ensures  that all records have relevant data.


**Refresh tag date if memo is updated**
: This option ensures that whenever you modify the  notes to the choice, the tag date gets updated with the date of modification.  When a vendor is tagged with a choice, **Everest**  records the date of tagging. You can also give additional information  for the choice as ‘Notes’.


**Web Enabled**
: Select this option if you want the Tracking Group  to be displayed on your online store.


**Security Description**
: This field denotes the security right for access  to the custom tracking group created. Only those users who  are assigned with this security right can tag any selection  belonging to this group.
