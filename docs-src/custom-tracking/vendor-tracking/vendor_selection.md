# Vendor Selection


The **Vendor Selection** option  (path: **Purchasing &gt; Custom Tracking 
 &gt; Vendor Selection**) generates a list of all vendors based on  the tracking selection criteria you have specified in the **Custom 
 Tracking List** dialog box.

You can use vendor selection to execute the following:

- **Sending 
 mass e-mails** - You can send bulk e-mails to the vendors in the  list.
- **Sending 
 faxes** - You can send faxes in bulk to the fax numbers of the vendors  in the list.

- **Printing 
 details** - You can print details of the selected vendors for further  action.



A few examples of situations where vendor selections can be effectively  used are:

- Promotional  campaigns
- New product  announcements
- Sending information  on customer requests
- Requesting  current price lists
- News, events  and updates
