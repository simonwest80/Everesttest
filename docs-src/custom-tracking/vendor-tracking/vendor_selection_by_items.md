# Vendor Selection by Items 


The **Vendor Selection by Items** option  provides a list of vendors whose purchase history includes or excludes  the items selected in the **Vendor Selection 
 by Item** dialog box.


Include List


All items in the database are listed in the **Include 
 list** grid with details such as item code, description and item  stock status details. You will have to select the items in the **Include 
 list** that you have purchased from a vendor.


A vendor is included in the generated list, if you have purchased at  least one of the items selected in the **Include****list** from that vendor.


Exclude List


All items in the database are listed in the **Exclude****list** grid with details such as  item code, description and item stock status details. Select the items  in the **Exclude** **list**  that you have not purchased from a vendor.


All vendors from whom you have purchased at least one of the items selected  in the **Include** **list**  and from whom you have NOT purchased any item selected in the **Exclude****list** is displayed in the generated  list.
