# The Clock In/Out Dialog Box


The **Clock** **In**/**Out** dialog box allows you to record  the number of hours an employee worked in the office premises.


**Employee**
: Select the employee code. This is a mandatory field.


**Time In**
: The time (start time) that the employee reports  for work is displayed. The  time displayed in this field is automatically obtained by the system from  the local workstation’s operating system settings when the Employee ID  is selected. Once recorded, this time does not change when viewed with  other time zone or daylight saving time (DST) settings.
: DST settings that change after  an employee clocks in but before clocking out impact only the clock out  time and not the clock in time.


**![]({{site.tc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  On  October 28, 2006, an employee clocks in at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time  changes at 2:00am on October 29, 2006. The employee clocks out at 6:00am  on October 29, 2006. The clock out time of 6:00am is from the revised  (changed) time.**


**Validate Time In**
: Click this button to confirm the employee's clock  in time. If the employee has already been clocked in, this button is not  activated.


{:.note}
Unless the clock in time is validated, the  employee clock in time is not recorded. As a result the employee cannot  be clocked out.


**Working Day**
: Check this box if the employee works on a holiday  that is counted as a working day.


**Time Out**
: The time from your local workstation’s operating  system settings is automatically displayed in the **Time 
 Out** field, when you select the code of the employee who is leaving  from work.
: DST settings that change after an employee clocks  in but before clocking out impact only the clock out time and not the  clock in time.


**![]({{site.tc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  On  October 28, 2006, an employee clocks in at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time  changes at 2:00am on October 29, 2006. The employee clocks out at 6:00am  on October 29, 2006. The clock out time of 6:00am is from the revised  (changed) time.**


**Validate Time Out**

{:.note}
If the clock out time is not validated, the employee cannot clock in  again.
