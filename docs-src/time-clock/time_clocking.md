You can also use the **Time Clock**  utility to create employee designations, work shifts, holidays, weekly  days off, leave types and office areas. The time zone and daylight savings  time details default from the client workstationâ€™s operating system settings  and not the **Everest** settings when  recording a transaction. Once a transaction is saved, it does not change  even when viewed from different time zones or with different daylight  savings settings.
