title: Time In
---


The time (start time) that the employee reports for work is displayed.  The time displayed in this field is automatically obtained by the system  from the local workstation’s operating system settings when the Employee  ID is selected. Once recorded, this time does not change when viewed with  other time zone or daylight saving time (DST) settings.


DST settings that change after an employee clocks in but before clocking  out impact only the clock out time and not the clock in time.


![]({{site.tc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  On  October 28, 2006, an employee clocks in at 9:00pm. Daylight saving time  changes at 2:00am on October 29, 2006. The employee clocks out at 6:00am  on October 29, 2006. The clock out time of 6:00am is from the revised  (changed) time.
