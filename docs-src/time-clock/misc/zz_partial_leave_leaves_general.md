title: Partial Leave
---


Check this box if the leave you are applying for is partial, that is,  it is less than one working day.


![]({{site.tc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â If  you take leave on the same day for 2 hours, it is considered as partial  leave, irrespective of whether you check the option or not.


If you specify the Start and End time as  9:00 and 11:00 for a week's leave, it has two implications:


 - If you  check this box, the leave is considered as partial on all the 5 days.


 - If you  do not check this box, the leave is considered as partial only on the  last day.
