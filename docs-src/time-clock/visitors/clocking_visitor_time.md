# Clocking Visitor Time


The Time clock feature allows you to maintain a record of the number  of hours spent by a visitor in the office premises.


The system automatically clocks the start time when the visitor’s name  is entered. It is imperative to validate the clock in time for the visitor  to be clocked out.


When the visitor’s name is  re-selected, the system automatically clocks the end time which is then  validated.


You can record other details including the organization the visitor  belongs to, purpose/nature of visit and the area to which access is permitted.
