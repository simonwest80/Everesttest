 Sample Events** option, do the following:

- From the main menu  bar of the **Everest** window, select **CRM &gt; CRM Studio &gt; Configuration**.  You will see the **Configuration - CRM 
 Studio** dialog box.
- From the **Configuration - CRM 
 Studio** dialog box, select **Options 
 &gt; Install/Upgrade Sample Events**. A **Confirmation**  window appears.
- Click **Yes**  to install/upgrade the sample events.



Whenever you upgrade **Everest**,  which has the CRM  Studio feature installed, you are prompted to install the latest sample  events as you try to access any feature of CRM  Studio. If you do not opt to upgrade the sample events, you can still  access the older version of the sample events. You can use the **Install/Upgrade 
 Sample Events** option from the menu at any point of time to install  the latest upgraded events.


{:.note}
This option will be enabled only when the  user does not have the latest sample events. This latest sample events  will be installed in the /Everest/ACRM  folder. However, the same will not be updated in CRM  Studio. Hence, in order to install the latest sample events, the user  has to either say 'Yes' when prompted or select the menu option manually.


You need to have rights to upgrade the events.
