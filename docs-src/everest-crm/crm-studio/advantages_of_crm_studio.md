# Advantages of CRM  Studio


In addition to the events defined in **Everest**,  you can create custom events by defining conditions. To create a Custom  Event, you are required to specify a condition using filters. Filters  are specific conditions that you give in order to narrow down your search  and get a consolidated data.


CRM Studio  has the following advantages:

- You can create  and monitor exceptional events.



{:.example}
In system events, you can track event when  sales invoice is created. In advanced events, you can track only those  events (by specifying conditions) where sales invoices for amounts greater  than 1000,000 are created. This is an exceptional event.

- You can attach  **Everest** reports to e-mails  dynamically.



{:.example}
When a sales invoice is created, you can generate  the sales invoice report in PDF  format and attach the report with the e-mail and send it to the respective  customer.

- In a similar  manner, reports that need to be send on a periodic basis (like Account  Receivable Aging, Best Customer report, Commission report etc.) can be  sent on a "need to know" basis (i.e., the data in the report  will be specific to the user/customer/vendor for whom it is intended)  at predefined frequency like weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.
