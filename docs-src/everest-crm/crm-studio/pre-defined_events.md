# Sample Events


Everest Software provides you with sample events (for the sample company)  containing more than 100 events and queries which cater to the usual business  requirements of an organization. In addition, CRM  Studio allows you to create custom events, queries, schedule reports,  etc. to meet your business needs.


In order to use the sample events, create a new application and link  the ODBC database  to this application. This will allow you to access events from the database.  You can customize the events according your business requirements.


When you install CRM  Studio, you can choose to install sample events for the Accel Sample Company  by selecting the **Sample Events**  option. This application is named as **Accel 
 Sample Company (Only for Reference) 5.0.XXX**, where 'XXX' is the  version number of the event pack. This version number may not be the same  as the **Everest** client version  number. You can use this as a reference and events can be copied into  new application created in CRM  Studio.


{:.note}
During a custom installation of **Everest**,  you can install the sample events by selecting the option **Sample 
 Events**. Even if you did not install the sample events while installing  **Everest**, **Everest**  verifies the existence of sample events when you select any of the CRM  Studio menu options. You can choose to install the sample events at this  stage also. It is then validated if the sample company is installed. If  the sample company exists, the sample company database and the CRM Studio  Application properties are automatically updated by **Everest**.


In order to use the reference events for the working  application, please note the following points:

- Create a new  working application.
- Copy the required  events from the sample events to the working application.
- Copy the related  query definitions, report definitions, scheduled reports and basic scripts  (if any) associated with the event, to the working application.
- Existing queries,  report definitions, basic scripts should be removed from the copied event  and the same should be attached from the working application.
- After copying  an event, select the **Active** check  box in the **Description** tab of  the event, otherwise the event will not be active and cannot be used.
