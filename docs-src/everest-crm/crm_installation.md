# CRM Installation


**Everest CRM**  is an add-on package to the **Everest**  suite of products. You have the option to buy the package either at the  time of purchasing **Everest**, or  at a later point of time.


For details, refer to **Everest Advanced 
 Edition - CRM Studio** Installation Guide.


{:.note}
- It is recommended  that you install **CRM Studio Server**  on a separate system (other than where **Everest 
 Data Server** is installed) to optimize performance.
- By default,  **CRM Studio** and the data files  install in the **Everest** directory.  They must be located on the same drive as **Everest**.  Â For example,  if you install **Everest** on the  C: drive, **CRM Studio** and the data  files must also be located on the C: drive. Similarly, if you install  **Everest** on the D: drive, **CRM Studio** and the data files must also  be located on the D: drive.
- When CRM Studio  server is installed on Windows 2000 server, the security for authenticated  users for **Data** directory (under  the CRM folder where **Everest CRM Studio**  is installed) should be manually edited and given full rights. Later this  can be revoked once an option is invoked under the CRM Studio menu in  the application.
- After installation  of **CRM Studio Server**, the user  should login to ASC company and invoke CRM - Architect. This will update  the ASC Company Application (for reference) with the latest sample events.  Later the user can access architect of his/her working company.
- There are two  sets of license keys used to activate **CRM 
 Studio**. The first one is entered during the installation of **CRM Studio** and the second one is entered  in the **CRM Studio Architect**.
- **CRM 
 Studio** activation codes are bound to the name of the server they  are installed on. If you need to re-install **CRM 
 Studio** on a different machine or rename it after the first 30 days,  a re-licensing charge will be incurred.
