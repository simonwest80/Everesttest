# Opportunity Management


Opportunity Management in **Everest CRM**helps you keep track of the possible sales opportunities that you  may encounter in business. Prospective customers and the value of sales  expected are tracked in **Everest CRM**using <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">the </font>[Sales  Opportunity]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/standard-crm/opportunity-management/the-sales-process.chm::/sales_opportunities_an_introduction.html) feature. Creating sales opportunities helps you track  the stage each opportunity is in, its probable value and expected date  of closure.


Sales opportunity may be tracked using the details given below:

- [Grade]({{site.sp_chm}}/opportunity-management/opportunity-grades/opportunity_grade.html)
- [Source]({{site.sp_chm}}/opportunity-management/sources-of-opportunities/source_of_opportunity.html)
- [Reason  closed]({{site.sp_chm}}/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reasons_closed_sales_opp.html)
- [Sales  stage]({{site.sp_chm}}/opportunity-management/sales-stages/sales_stages.html)



You can enter sales opportunity details such as source, grade, stage  and reason closed directly in a sales quote, order and invoice without  creating a sales opportunity first.


Maintaining sales opportunity details for sales quotes, orders or invoices  that are created directly is important for the following reasons:

- You can track  the stage in which the sales quote is.
- You can measure  the effectiveness of the various means of advertisement by keeping track  of the source of the sale.
- You can track  the reasons for clinching the order.
