# Define Activities


{:.steps}
To define activities, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Business Activity Monitoring &gt; Processes/Activities**. You  will see the **Process/Activities**  browser.
- From the browser,  select **Options &gt; New &gt; Activity 
 &gt; In New Window**. You will see the [**Activity** profile]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/standard-crm/bam/activity/the_activity_profile.html).



{:.note}
You cannot access a new **Activity**  profile without a process. To enable the new profile, a process should  already exist under which the activity is to be defined.
