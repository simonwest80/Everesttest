A process consists of a series of activities defined under it. When  you define activities, they will be in the order of creation. You can  change the sequence of the order as per your convenience, using the **Activities** section of the **Process**  profile (in the edit mode). Select activities and choose ![]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/img/crm_up_arrow.gif) or ![]({{site.crm_baseurl}}/img/crm_down_arrow.gif) arrows to change the sequence.
