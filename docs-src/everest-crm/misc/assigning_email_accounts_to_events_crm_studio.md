# Assigning E-mail Accounts to Events


You have to assign e-mail accounts to events if you want to send an  e-mail upon triggering of an event. For each event an e-mail account can  be assigned or the same account can be assigned for different events.  When the event occurs, the e-mail is sent from the account that you have  specified.


{:.steps}
To assign e-mail accounts to events, do the  following:

- From the main  menu, select **CRM 
 &gt; CRM Studio 
 &gt; Architect**. You will see the **Everest 
 CRM Studio 
 Architect** dialog box.
- Under **Application Events** in the tree view,  select the application for which you wish to assign the e-mail accounts.
- Select the  **Events** option. You will see a  list of events in the right panel.
- Select the  event for which you wish to assign the e-mail account and double-click  to edit. You will see the **Everest CRM 
 Studio - Application Events/Events** dialog box.
- Select the  **Email** tab and specify the e-mail  account. You can also include reports or files as attachments and send  them along with the e-mail.
