# Assigning Subscribers to Events


You can add subscribers to events and link them in order to retrieve  subscriber information. Subscriber linking is the ability to have **Everest** retrieve subscriber information  (such as a person’s name, e-mail address, fax number, pager number, PIN,  etc.) from one or more external application databases.


Subscriber linking uses an established **Everest**  function – queries – to identify the subscribers you wish to link to.  Just as you would design a query to retrieve a specific set of database  records for an event, Subscriber Linking requires that you design a query  that identifies which records (within a database table) will be retrieved  and subsequently used as potential event subscribers.
