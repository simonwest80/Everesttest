# Database Update Utility


The **Database Update Utility**  is used to update the system and company databases. It safely updates  your current databases to the latest version of **Everest**.  Your old databases are not removed until the new databases have been successfully  updated. Because of this safety feature, additional disk space is required.

When you create a company in **Everest**,  a company database which has all the details pertaining to that company  is created automatically. The system database contains common data required  for the smooth functioning of all the company databases.


When you install a new version of **Everest**,  the default databases are updated. The system database and the company  databases are not updated. If your installation detects that your databases  have not been updated, you have the option to launch the Database Update  Utility. At least one company (other than the Accel Sample Company) must  be updated before you can continue with the installation upgrade. If you  decide not to update the databases, when you log into **Everest**  the next time, a mismatch between the default database and the company  or system database is detected. This occurs because **Everest**  compares the databases and identifies if the company or system database  has to be updated.


**Everest** displays a message and  allows you to proceed with the update process.


Select the **Details** check box  to view additional details.


Click **Yes** to proceed. You will  see the **Database Update Wizard**.


{:.note}
You cannot log in to **Everest**  unless you have updated the database.
