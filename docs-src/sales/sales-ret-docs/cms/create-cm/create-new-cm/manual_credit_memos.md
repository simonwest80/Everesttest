# Manual Credit Memos


Manual credit memos are created when you create an entry in a sales  journal crediting the customer. The document number is auto-generated  and is prefixed with '**M**'  to denote a manual credit memo.


If the document number is left blank, the sequence number for manual  credit memos specified in the logged in location or sub-location is used.  If the location's sequence number is blank, the sequence number specified  for the default location is used.


You can also modify or make refunds from within the manual document  profile.

**View Manual Credit Memos**
: You can view manual credit memos from the **Credit Memos** browser by selecting the  **Accounting** option from the **View** menu (path: **Credit 
 Memos** browser > **View**  > **Accounting**). Manual Credit  Memos have a **CM#** that is prefixed  with “M”.  Manual  documents also display “Accounting” in the **Type**  column.


**Modify Manual Credit Memos**
: You can modify manual credit memos from the **Credit Memo** profile just as you would  with system documents. This is the preferred method for making manual  credit memo modifications since only limited modifications are possible  from the sales journal.
