# Accounting Entries - Creating a Credit Memo


When an item that is sold is returned, the entries made for accounting  for cost of goods sold or expenses are reversed. The returned items are  taken back into stock. The cost at which the item is taken back is:

- **Serialized 
 items** - Actual cost of each serial number.
- **Non-serialized 
 items** - The average cost of the item at the time of creating the  credit memo.
- **Non-inventoried 
 items** -


- Where the non-inventoried  item has an asset account defined, the asset account is credited with  the value of the item considering the average cost of the item at the  time of creating the credit memo.
- Where the non-inventoried  item has an expense and liability account defined, the expense account  is credited with the value of the item considering the average cost of  the item at the time of creating the credit memo and the liability account  is debited.
