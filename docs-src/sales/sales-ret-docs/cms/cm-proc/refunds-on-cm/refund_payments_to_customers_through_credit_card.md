Refunds to customers from a credit memo can be made by credit card.  A credit card payment is automatically processed only when the payment  method for the credit card has the **Use****Payment Processor** option selected  in the **Payment Method** profile  (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window** > **Credit Card Processing** tab).

- From the **Credit Memo** profile, select **Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Refund**. You will see the [**Refund** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/refunds/dlg/the_payment_dialog_box_refund_cm.html).
- Select the  appropriate credit card payment method in the **Payment 
 Method** field.
- Enter the amount  to be refunded in the **Amount** field.
