# Collections on a Credit Memo


You may initially refund a customer for items that are returned. Later,  your customer may decide to take another item in exchange for the returned  item. In this case, you would receive either a full or partial collection  on a credit memo from the customer.


Collections from customers on a credit memo can be made by cash, check  or by credit card. A credit card payment is processed when you select  the **Use Payment Processor** option  in the **Credit Card Processing**  tab (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Credit Card Processing** tab).


{:.steps}
To receive collection on a credit memo, do  the following:

- From the **Credit Memo** profile, select **Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Collect**. You will see the [**Collection** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/collections/dlg/the_collection_dialog_box.html).
- Enter the amount  to be collected in the **Amount**  field.
- Click **OK**.



{:.note}
The **Collect** option  is enabled only when the you have made a refund on the credit memo.
