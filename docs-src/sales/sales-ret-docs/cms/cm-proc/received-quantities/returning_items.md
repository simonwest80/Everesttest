# Receiving Returned Items


**When an existing credit order is processed  to a credit memo, the **Requested** column  for an item displays the 'Requested' quantity at the time of conversion.**


The **Credited** column displays  the quantity committed on the order. If no quantity is committed in the  credit order, the **Credited** column  in the credit memo displays zero.


**If you create a credit memo directly, the  **Credited** column defaults to zero.  Enter the quantity being returned in this column.**
