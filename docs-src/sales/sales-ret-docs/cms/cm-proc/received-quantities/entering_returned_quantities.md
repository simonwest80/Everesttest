# Enter Returned Quantities


The procedure for entering the returned  quantity for items may be categorized under the following:

- **Serialized 
 Items** - If the quantity returned is more than what is committed,  or you are creating a credit memo, select **Options 
 &gt; Attach/Retrieve Serial Number &gt; Serial Number** or **Serial Number Range** or **Manufacturer's 
 Serial Number** to retrieve additional serial numbers. The returned  quantity can be more than the requested quantity.

- **Non-serialized 
 Items** - Double-click in the **Credited** column of a line item to view the **Attach 
 Quantity** profile. The **Attach Quantity**  profile is displayed based on the preference you have set in the **Location** profile (**Stock 
 transfer &gt; Miscellaneous** tab). This **** profile displays a list of stock areas and the quantities attached  for return. Enter the quantity returned in the required stock area.

- **Non-inventoried 
 Items** - The quantity returned can be directly entered in the **Credited** column for the item.


- **Auto-serialized 
 Items** - To attach serial numbers to an auto-serialized item on  the credit memo, select **Options &gt; 
 Attach/Retrieve Serial # &gt; Serial #**. Attach the serial  number from an 'Out' type of stock area to the credit memo. When you save  the credit memo, the item is transferred to a 'Stock' type of stock area.
