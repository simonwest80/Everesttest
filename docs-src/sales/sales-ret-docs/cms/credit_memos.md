# Credit Memos


A credit memo (path: **Invoicing**  > **Credit** **Memos****&gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**)  is created to account for the items or services returned. The credit memo  in **Everest,** thus, serves a dual  purpose:

- **Recording 
 return of items** - The credit memo acts a 'Goods Received Note'  as items are taken into inventory only after their return is recorded  on the credit memo.
- **Accounting 
 for Sales returns** - The credit memo is the base document for accounting  the amount of sales returns.



A credit memo is required to do the following:

- Enter returns  against a credit order.
- Record the  returned items and quantities for inventory purpose.
- Automatically  account for the loss or profit on return.
