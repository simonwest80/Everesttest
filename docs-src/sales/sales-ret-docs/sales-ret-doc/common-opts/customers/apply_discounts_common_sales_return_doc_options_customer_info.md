# Apply Discounts


Discounts are calculated based on the discount schemes that are set  up for items in **Everest**.


The **Apply Discounts** option must  be used in the following situations:

- Where the option  **Automatically apply item discounts applicable 
 to a customer when retrieving the item on a document** is not selected  in the **Documents** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Document Payments**  tab).
- Where modifications  are made to the discounts calculated and applied. Selecting the **Apply Discounts** option re-calculates  discounts available to the customer on all the items and overwrites the  modifications made.



{:.steps}
To apply the discounts, do the following:

- From the Credit  Quote/Order/Memo profile, select **Options 
 &gt; Customers &gt; Apply Discounts**.



The specified discounts are applied and can be viewed in the **Discount 
 Value** and **Discount** **%** columns of the Item Details Grid.
