# Document Date


The date displayed in a sales return document is the date of creation  of the document. If a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted  to a memo, the date displayed on the order or the memo will be the login  date on which the document was converted.


In a credit memo document, the document date determines the accounting  period in which the accounting entries for sales return must be created.


You cannot change the date on the document once it has been saved.

The document date is used to compute the due date for the document,  if the payment terms are **On Account** for  the payment term of type **Specified days 
 from invoice**. (The transaction is a credit transaction and settlement  is required in the due date only).
