# Document Notes


Notes can be attached to sales return documents to keep track of important  messages or information pertaining to the document. The note attached  to the document will not be printed along with the document.

You can also set up flow control preferences for the following:

- To popup  the document note every time a document is opened, select the option **Popup and first show notes attached to the 
 document prior to opening it** (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Documents**  > **Popups**tab).
- To ensure that  notes attached to a document are copied to the final document, select  the option **Copy the notes attached to 
 an order to its corresponding final document (when converting from an 
 order to a final document)** (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Documents**  > **Popups**tab).



![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Notes  attached to a quote can be copied to the order, when the quote is converted  to order. Similarly notes attached to the order will be copied to the  memo.
