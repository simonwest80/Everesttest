# Preview On/Off


The **Preview** **On**/**Off** option (path: sales return document  profile > **Options** > **Preview On/Off**) allows you to view the  extended notes for a line item. When the inline notes extend to more than  one line, the inline note appears in the line below the line item. You  can choose to view the inline notes or hide the inline notes.


Choose **Preview On** to view the  extended notes in the new line and **Preview 
 Off** to hide the same.

You can access the same option in the **Status 
 Bar** of the sales return document by clicking on the ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_preview_on_button.gif) button.
