# Expiry Date


The **Expiry****Date** field displays the date on  which a credit quote or credit order will become invalid. In case of a  credit quote, it also indicates that the rates at which the returns will  be accepted, are valid until the expiry  date. This field also helps to filter for expired credit quotes, so that  they can be purged using the **Purge**  utility.


In case of credit orders,  the expiry  date may be used as the date by which the customer must confirm acceptance  of the RMA.


{:.note}
A credit quote or order that has expired can still be  converted to an order or memo.
