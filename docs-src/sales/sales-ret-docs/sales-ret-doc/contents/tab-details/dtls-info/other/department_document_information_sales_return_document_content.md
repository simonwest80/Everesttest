# Loc/Sub-Loc


The **Loc/Sub-Loc** field identifies  the location or the sub-location to which the document belongs. When a  new quote, order or memo is created, the **Loc/Sub-Loc** field displays the login  location/sub-location. If required you can assign a different location  or sub-location to the document.


When you assign a location/sub-location  to the document, you can keep track of the credit documents by sub-location  and print reports for management information purposes.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You can generate a report  of all credit quotes raised from the retail department to review the returns  received in that department and inquire into the causes.


When a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to a  memo, the location/sub-location specified in the original quote or order  is displayed in the converted order or memo. You can change the location/sub-location  for a sales return document before you post the journal for the credit  memo.


The document's location/sub-location detail is required to print the  addresses and logo on the document. Location/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected,  the address and logo of the sub-location's location is used.

 location/sub-location** (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Documents**  > **Miscellaneous** > **Others &gt; Others 2** tab) to ensure  that users are allowed to open only those documents that belong to the  user's location/sub-location.
