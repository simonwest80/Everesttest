# Ship Via


The **Ship** **Via**  field allows you to specify the delivery method used for item shipment.  Whenever a new sales return document is created, the default delivery  method specified in the **Customer**  profile is displayed (path: **Invoicing**  > **Customer** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Miscellaneous**  tab). You can select another delivery method if required. The delivery  method is a factor in computing sales tax.

The delivery method is also used to:

- Estimate freight  due on the shipment (where the price quoted to the customer is inclusive  of freight).
- To track shipments.
