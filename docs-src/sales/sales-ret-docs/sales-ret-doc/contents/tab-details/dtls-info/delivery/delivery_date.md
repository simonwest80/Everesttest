# Delivery Date


The **Delivery** **Date**  field in a credit quote or a credit order allows you to specify the date  of expected delivery of the shipment from the customer. When a new document  is created, by default the **Delivery Date**  field displays the current system date. This field helps plan management  of inventories or schedule repair jobs.


The delivery date on a credit memo identifies the date on which the  items were actually returned, as there could be a time lag between the  date on which the items were returned and the date on which the credit  memo was created.


When a new credit quote, credit order or credit memo document is created,  the **Delivery Date** field defaults  to the login  date. When you convert a credit quote to a credit order or a credit order  to a credit memo, the following will occur:

- The converted  credit order displays the login  date, if the delivery date on the credit quote is blank.
- The converted  credit order displays the date on the credit quote, if a delivery date  has been specified in the credit quote.
