# Extended Notes


To enter an extended note that wraps across lines, enter the note in  the **Description/Notes** window (path:  Sales Return Document profile > **Options**  > **Inline** **Notes**)  and click on **Expand to** **Document**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_expand_to_document.gif) icon. Each line in your note will be added as an additional  line in the description column.


**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you enter a note with 4 lines and extract it to the document, 4 more lines  are added.**


A timer can be invoked in the **Description/Notes**  window to record the number of minutes and seconds for a service type  item.


**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) In  case of service calls that you record by the hour, you can select an item  that represents the service cost. When you begin to speak to the customer's  customer service, you can activate the timer and on conclusion of the  call stop the timer and thereby record the total time spent on the call.**
