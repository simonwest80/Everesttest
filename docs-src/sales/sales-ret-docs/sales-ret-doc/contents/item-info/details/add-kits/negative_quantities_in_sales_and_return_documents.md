# Negative Quantities in Sales and Return Documents


You can enter negative quantities in sales/sales return documents. This  is useful when accounting for the exchange or return of an item on the  document without having to create a document.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you are creating a sales invoice and the customer returns an item that  was purchased earlier, you can directly enter the returned quantity as  a negative line item, without having to create a credit memo.


When you enter negative quantities in a sales document:

- It is as good as  creating a sales return document and vice versa.



![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Entering  a negative quantity in a sales order is like creating a credit order.

- The back-end processes  and accounting entries are Â the  same as for a sales return document.
- The amount of a  line item with negative quantity also becomes negative.



The total amount of the sales document is the sum of the positive amounts  and the negative amounts. Although you are allowed to enter negative quantities,  the total amount of the sales document after adding the positive and negative  amounts on each line item must be positive. In other words, the document  is not allowed to change its character as the result of entering negative  quantities.

If the total amount of a sales invoice becomes negative,  it in effect becomes a credit<font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000"> </font>memo which is  not allowed.


You can scan and enter the Invoice # or Gift Receipt to process returns.
