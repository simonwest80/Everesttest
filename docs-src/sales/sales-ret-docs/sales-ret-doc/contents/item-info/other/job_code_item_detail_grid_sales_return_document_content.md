# Job Code


The **Job Code** column displays  the job to which the revenues and expenses for the line item in a sales  return document must be allocated. You can select the specific job code  to which the line item in a sales return document must be assigned. All  open jobs are available for selection. If required, you can assign different  job codes to different line items in a sales return document.


{:.steps}
To assign a job code to a line item, do the  following:

- Place your  cursor in the **Job Code** column  in the **Item Details Grid** of the  sales return document and click **Enter**.  You will see a drop-down ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_drop_down_arrow.gif) arrow.
- Click on the  drop-down ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_drop_down_arrow.gif) arrow, you will see a list of job codes. Select  a record and double-click.



**Everest** validates the job code  before assigning it to a line item in a sales return document. The following  are the validations carried out before a job code is assigned to a line  item in a sales return document:
