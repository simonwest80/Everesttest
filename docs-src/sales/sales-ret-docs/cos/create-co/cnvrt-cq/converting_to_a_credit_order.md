# Convert to a Credit Order


**You can convert the quote to a credit order  by using the **Reserve** option. Once  the order has been converted, the credit quote ceases to exist as a system  document and generates a credit order with **Open**  status. The credit quote can no longer be accessed from the **Credit 
 Quotes** browser; however, it appears as a reference number in the  credit order created. The document number for the new credit order is  automatically generated by the system.**


{:.steps}
To convert a credit quote into a credit order,  do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Credit 
 Quote**. You will see the **Credit 
 Quotes** browser.
- From the **Credit Quotes** browser, highlight the  quote that has to be converted to a credit order.
- Select **Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.  You will see the **Credit Quote** profile.
- From the **Credit Quote** profile, select **Process 
 &gt; Reserve**. The credit quote is converted to a credit order.
