# Manual Credit Orders


Manual credit orders are created when you create an entry in a receipts  journal crediting the customer with the entry type 'Miscellaneous Deposit'.  The document number is auto-generated and prefixed with '**M**'  denoting that it is a manual credit order. The sequence number for manual  credit orders specified in the login location/sub-location is used. If  the location's sequence number is blank, the sequence number for the default  location is used.


You can make modifications from within the manual credit order profile  and convert credit orders to credit memos in the same manner as system  documents.

**View Manual Credit Orders**


You can view manual credit orders from the **Credit 
 Orders** browser. Manual credit orders have a **CO#**  that is prefixed with “M”.


**Modify Manual Credit Orders**


You can modify manual credit orders from the **Credit 
 Order** profile just as you would with system documents. This is  the preferred method for making manual credit order modifications since  only limited modifications are possible from the receipts journal.
