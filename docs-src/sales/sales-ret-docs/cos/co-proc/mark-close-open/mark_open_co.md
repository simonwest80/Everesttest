# Mark Open - Credit Order


**Use the **Mark 
 Open** option to re-open a closed order.**


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You close an order when the  customer informs you that the items would no longer be returned to you.  At a later stage, if the customer wants to return the item, you would  open the order.


**You may change the status of a closed credit  order to "open" by increasing the quantity requested or adding  new items on the order, though it is not mandatory.**


**If you try to save a closed credit order  after adding a new item or increasing the requested quantity, **Everest**  prompts you of the same. If you click **YES,**  the order status changes to "Backorder" if there are partially  credited quantities or to "Open" if the quantity credited is  zero. If you click **NO,** the status  remains open and changes are not saved.**


**If you try to re-open a credit order without  adding new line items or increasing the requested quantity, you do not  get any message.**


{:.note}
If you save an order after modification/addition of  inline notes or extended notes, the order status remains closed. Â You  need to select the **Mark Open** option  to re-open the order.


{:.steps}
To mark an order open, you must do the following:

- From the **Credit Orders** browser, select **Options &gt; Received Credit Orders.** You  will see the **Received Credit Orders**  browser.
- Highlight the  required document and select **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**. You will see the **Credit 
 Order** profile.
- Add the item  that is being returned if the item does not exist on the order.
- If the item  to be returned exists on the credit order, increase the requested quantity.



**When items are added to the credit order  and the document is saved, the status of the order changes to 'Open'.**
