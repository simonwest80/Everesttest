# Cancel a Credit Order


**If you do not wish to continue the sales  return process with your customer, you can cancel the credit order using  the **Cancel Order** option from the  **Credit Orders** profile (path: **Credit Order** profile > **Options 
 &gt; Process &gt; Cancel Order**).**


**The following credit orders cannot be canceled:**

- A credit order  that is a backorder.
- A credit order  that has items committed.
- A closed credit  order.



**When you cancel the credit order, it gets  converted to a credit quote irrespective of whether the credit order was  created directly or by converting a credit quote. The credit quote becomes  available again as a system document.**
