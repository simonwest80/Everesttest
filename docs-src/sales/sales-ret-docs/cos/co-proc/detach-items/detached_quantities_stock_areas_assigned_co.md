# Detached Quantities - Stock Areas Assigned


Detached quantities are moved to the default stock area that is specified  in the **Workstation** **Settings**  or the stock transfer preferences specified for the login  location.


Stock areas to which items detached from a credit order are assigned,  are **Out** type of stock areas. This  is because you still do not own the stock returned to you.

The stock area to which detached quantities are assigned is determined  by the following rules:

- If a default  stock area for unassigned items on credit orders is specified in the **Workstation Settings** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales** tab), the  quantities are assigned to this stock area.
- If no default  stock area is defined in **Workstation****Settings**, the items are assigned  to the stock area defined for unassigned items on credit orders in the  logged in location or sub-location (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; 
 New &gt; Location &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Sales Document** tab). If no stock area is defined for logged in location or sub-location,  the stock area defined for the default location is used.

- If no default  stock areas for unassigned items on credit orders are defined in **Workstation Settings** or in stock transfer  preferences of the login  location as above, the default stock area defined for **Sales 
 Invoices** in the **Workstation Settings** (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales** tab)  is used.
- If no default  stock area for unassigned credit orders is defined in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box or the logged in location and no default stock  area for **Sales invoices** is defined  in **Workstation Settings** dialog  box, the items are assigned to the stock area defined for sales invoices  in the logged in location or sub-location (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location** > **Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window** >  **Stock** **Transfer**  > **Sales** **Document**  tab). If no stock area is defined for the logged in location or sub-location,  the stock area defined for the default location is used.
