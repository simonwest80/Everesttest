# Advantages - Creating a Credit Quote


Although you can create a credit order without creating a credit quote,  there are certain advantages in creating a quote:

- **Record 
 customer negotiations** - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.
- **Manage 
 customer contacts** - It helps to easily retrieve the details of  the quote during negotiations with the customer. The contact manager feature  in **Everest** allows you to associate  tasks and appointments, incoming and outgoing calls, with a specified  quote.
- **Minimize data entry while creating credit orders**  - When a credit quote is converted to an order, the information in the  credit quote flows into the credit order, thus, reducing data entry for  order creation.
- **RMA 
 number** - It is the basis for issuing an RMA  number to the customer.
