# Retrieve a Credit Quote


Once a credit quote is converted to a credit order, the credit quote  can no longer be viewed in the **Credit 
 Quotes** browser.


To retrieve a credit quote, you must cancel the credit order. The credit  order then reverts to the credit quote and can once again be viewed from  the **Credit Quotes** browser.
