# Book for Later Shipment


When there is a time gap between the delivery of goods or services and  the time of order (e.g., in mail order shipments), funds can be blocked  from the cardholder's account. Such blocking of funds is called 'booking  for later payment'. This is similar to authorization. When the goods and  services are delivered, another request is sent to capture the funds.
