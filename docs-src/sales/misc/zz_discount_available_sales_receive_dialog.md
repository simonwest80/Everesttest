title: Discount Available
---


Discounts may be available for prompt payment based on the payment terms  for the sales invoice. Whether a payment is eligible for discount depends  on the discount type and login date when recording the payment. The discount  available for the current payment is calculated and displayed in this  field. Discounts are calculated only on sales invoices. This is a display  field.


{:.example}
A document's payment terms indicates that a payment receipt is due 60  days after the invoice date, and a discount of 2% is allowed for payments  made within 30 days. The settings in the **Payment 
 Terms** profile are:


1. **Due Date Type**  is "Specified days from invoice" (for 60 days)


2. **Discount Type**  is "Specified days from invoice" (for 30 days)


You create the sales invoice on 15th September and you receive from  the customer on 15th October. Since payment is made on the 30th day (i.e.  Login date - Invoice creation date), two percent of the document amount  is displayed as the amount of discount available.
