- Select the **Exclude from pull sheet and invoice**  option if committed line items should NOT appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items will NOT be selected on the **Pick 
 Ticket** preview, and therefore, will not appear on the pull sheet.  Â Manually  committed items will still be invoiced if they are part of a sales order  that is converted using the Pull Sheet.
- Select the **Include in the pull sheet** option if  committed items should appear on the Pull sheet. The manually committed  line items will be selected (checked) on the **Pick 
 Ticket** preview, and therefore, will appear on the pull sheet. The  manually committed line items are indicated in bright green on the **Pull Sheet** browser for easy reference.  This lets you know that inventory is already committed to the item. This  option is selected by default when a new filter is created.



{:.note}
If a line item has inventory committed from  multiple stock bins, each bin will be shown on separate lines in the Pull  Sheet and Pick Ticket report.
