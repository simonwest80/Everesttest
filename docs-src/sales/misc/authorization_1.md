**Authorization**


An authorization is a request to charge a cardholder. When a charge is authorized, the cardholder's open-to-buy (available limit) reduces, but the funds are not actually captured. The card is not billed until a request is made by the merchant to capture the transaction.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Let's say your customer has a credit limit of $10000. The customer places an order for goods worth $4000. The available limit reduces to $6000 although the customer is not required to pay the $4000 until you send a request with the authorization code for capturing the funds. The funds are transferred to your account only after this request is made and the customer's account is debited.
