title: Print Line Notes
---


Select this check box to print any line notes associated with the line  item. If there are blank lines in between line items/notes, they are considered  as attached to the item code above them and are printed below the same  line item after sorting.


You can specify line notes:

- Directly in  the **Description/Note** column of  the document.
- In the **Extended sales description** field (path:  **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Item** profile **&gt; Notes** tab).
- Using the **Inline Notes** option (path: document  profile > **Options**).
