# Other Information


The other information that can be specified in the **Recurrence 
 Pattern** dialog box is detailed below:


Document Date
: This section allows you to define the creation date  of sales invoices.


**Schedule date based on recurrence pattern**
: Select this option if the sales invoice date must  be based on the recurrence pattern.
: ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  define the recurrence pattern as 'the first of every month'  and select the **Schedule date based on 
 recurrence pattern** option. You then log in to **Everest**  on 15**th** of May and process  the sales order dated 1**st**  May. The creation date of the sales invoice will be 1**st**  May.


**Date when the order is actually converted to  final**
: Select this option if the sales invoice date should  be independent of the recurrence pattern.
: ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) In  the previous example, if you select the **Date 
 when the order is actually converted to final** option, the sales  invoice will be dated 15**th**  May.


**Create reminder tasks to convert sales order  into invoice on the scheduled dates**
: Select this option to create automatic reminder  tasks using the **Contact Manager**  function in **Everest** reminding  you to convert the sales orders to sales invoices on the specified due  date. Clear this option if you do not want automatic reminder tasks. If  you select this option, when you define the recurrence pattern and click  **OK**, tasks are automatically created.


**Notes**
: Details entered in the **Notes**  field of the **Recurrence Pattern**  dialog box display as **Notes** in  the reminder tasks.
