# Special Tax Rule Override


If you have defined a special tax rule for the jurisdiction specified  in the sales document, select the **Special 
 tax rule override** option to apply the tax code specified in the **Special Tax Rules** profile (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes 
 &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**).


{:.note}
The **Document Override** check box in the **Rules**  tab of the **Special Tax Rules** profile  has to be selected.


If the option selected in the **Tax Calculation 
 Type** field was previously set to **Manual****O****verride**  or **Automatic**, and you select **Special tax rule override**, the tax code  as defined in the **Special Tax Rules**  profile is applied.


If no special tax rule is specified for the jurisdiction, you are prompted  with a message that you cannot override tax and no record with an override  option is found in the **Special Tax Rules**  profile. Click **OK** to return to  the sales document.


The tax code defined in the **Special 
 Tax Rules** profile (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**) is also applied to the new items  added to the documents.


{:.note}
When you manually change the tax code, the **Tax 
 Calculation Type** field displays the **Manual 
 override** option.
