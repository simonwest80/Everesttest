title: Qty

Every time an item is correctly scanned or entered in the  **Scan or type product details** field,  the quantity in the **Qty** field  increases by 1.


The **Qty** field defaults  to 1 for each entry, but with the appropriate security right, you can  change the quantity for regular items. Serial numbers always scan as 1  unit and the quantity cannot be changed.


When committed, the quantity in the **Qty**  field of the **Commit Inventory**  dialog box increases the quantity in the Committed column of the sales  order for the line item.
