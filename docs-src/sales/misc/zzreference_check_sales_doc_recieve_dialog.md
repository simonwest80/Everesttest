Use this option to specify a reference for the payment. When you receive  a check from the customer you can enter the check number here. This number  appears in the receipt journal. Where the payment method is any other  type of payment, enter a suitable reference. In case of cash payments,  you can enter the cash voucher number, or for wire transfers, the transfer  reference.
