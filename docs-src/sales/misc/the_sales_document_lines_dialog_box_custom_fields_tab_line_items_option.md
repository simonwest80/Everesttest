# The Sales Document Lines Dialog Box - Custom Fields Tab


Use the **Custom Fields** tab to  define additional information for any record as character strings, or  date, logical, memo or numeric fields. Custom fields defined in the **Sales Document Lines** dialog box â€“ **Custom Fields** tab apply to all sales  document line items.


{:.example}
To track the box numbers that sales document  line items are placed in for shipping purposes; define a **Box 
 Number** numeric custom field. This line item custom field displays  for all sales document line items.


Sales document line item custom fields carry forward to subsequent document  types as the documents are processed.


{:.example}
Line item custom fields created in a sales  quote will be copied to the sales order as well as the sales invoice as  the document goes through the sales cycle.


Custom fields defined in the **Item**  profile do not carry forward to the document line items.


{:.example}
A **Color**  custom field is defined only in the **Item**  profile. When adding a line item to a sales order, the **Color**  field does not display.
