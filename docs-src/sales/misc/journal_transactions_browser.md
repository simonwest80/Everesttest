# The Journal Transactions Browser


The **Journal Transactions** browser  is displayed when you click the **Posted/Unposted**section in the status bar of the **Sales 
 Invoice/Credit Memo** profile.


This browser displays the accounting entry that is created  when the sales invoice/credit memo is saved. It also displays the accounts  that are debited or credited, entry type, amount of debit or credit, the  sales journal and transaction number in which the entry is recorded, the  document number and date, terms and due date on the document, the source  of transaction, and posted status.


The **Entry Type**  column provides additional information regarding the accounting entry.


{:.example}
This column allows you to easily view commissionable  costs of goods sold.


You can view the amounts in base currency or the customer's currency.  Use the option **View in Base Currency** (path: **Journal Transactions** browser  > **Options &gt; View in Base Currency**)  to view the amounts in base currency. This is a toggle option that also  allows you to view the amounts in the customer's currency.
