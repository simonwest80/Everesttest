The zip or postal code of the  document's location/sub-location is displayed by default. You can change  the zip code from where the shipment originated if required.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If you  create the document in one location but your warehouse is located elsewhere,  you can change the zip/ postal code of the Ship From Address.


The zip or postal code is picked up from the **Location**  profile (path: File > Setup >  Accounting > Location/Sub-Location > Options > Edit > In New  Window).


This field is displayed only if you select the **Zip/Postal 
 Code** option in the **Region**  field.
