# Stage


This field allows you to search for sales orders using the stage defined  in the sales opportunity associated with the order.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If 'Draft proposal'  is a stage, you can search for sales orders on this basis.


{:.note}
For sales orders that are created without creating a  sales opportunity, sales stage 1 is assigned by default in the **Sales 
 Opportunity** profile. Unless you edit the opportunity and change  the sales stage, the orders will appear under stage 1 in this search parameter.


You can select multiple stages.
