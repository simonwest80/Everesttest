# Historical


If you select this option, the **Sales 
 Invoice** browser displays a list of all the sales invoice documents  that have been imported using the [Data  Import Wizard]({{site.utl_chm}}/db-utils/data-import/data_import_wizard_utility_content.html) (path: **Utility &gt; 
 Import &gt; Data**).


**Everest** prefixes the document  number you enter for reference with an 'H' to denote that it is a historical  document.
