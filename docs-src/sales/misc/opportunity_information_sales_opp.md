# Opportunity Information


**Opportunity**
: This is the identification number for the opportunity.  It is generated automatically when you save the opportunity.
: The sequence number assigned to a new sales opportunity  is the next number in sequence specified for sales quotes in the location  of the login sub-location. If you log into a location, the next number  in sequence for the login location is used.

: If sequence numbers have not been specified for  the login location/sub-location, the sequence numbers specified for the  default location are used.

{:.note}
When you create a sales quote directly, the opportunity  ID displays the sales quote number. When you convert an opportunity to  a sales quote, it bears the same number as the opportunity ID.


**Opening Date**
: This is the date on which the opportunity was created.  By default, the login date is displayed here. In case the sales quote,  order or invoice is directly created, the document date is displayed here.


**Document Alias**
: When you create a sales opportunity, by default,  it is created as a sales quote with the document alias 'Sales Opportunity'.  **Everest** automatically creates  this alias for sales quotes. This field displays the document alias with  which the sales opportunity is created. You can also select another alias  from this field.
: Sales opportunities may be viewed from the **Sales Opportunities** browser (path: **Invoicing &gt; Sales Opportunities**).  They may also be viewed in the document alias browser (path: **Invoicing 
 &gt; Other Documents &gt; Sales Quotes &gt; Sales Opportunity**).
