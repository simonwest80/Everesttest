title: Lease Rent
---


The amount that has to be paid as lease/rent is automatically computed  and displayed in this field. This rent is payable once for every period  specified in the lease/rental frequency. The lease/rent is computed by  multiplying the document total by the lease factor specified in the **Lease Plan** profile. The document total  is the sum of the taxable amount, exempt amount and sales tax amount.


{:.example}
If the lease/rent factor is 0.035, and the  document amount is $10000, and frequency is monthly, the lease/rent to  be paid per month is $350 (0.035\*10000).
