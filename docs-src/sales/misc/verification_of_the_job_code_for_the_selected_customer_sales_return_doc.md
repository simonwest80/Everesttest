# Verification of the Job Code for the selected Customer


If a job code is associated to a customer and you retrieve that customer  in a sales document, you are informed that one or more open job codes  exist for the customer. You are further asked if you would like to use  the job code for the document.


The customer code attached to the job code may NOT match the customer  code defined in the billing address of the sales return document. In such  a case, you will be prompted with a message that states that the selected  job code is not assigned to the customer. You will be asked if you still  wish to use the job code. Click **Yes**  if you want to assign the job code to the line item. You need appropriate  security rights to assign a job code that is not assigned to a customer,  to a line item. Click **No** to return  to the sales return document.
