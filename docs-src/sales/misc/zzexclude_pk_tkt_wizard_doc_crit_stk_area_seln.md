Items contained in the bins specified in this column cannot be attached  to the pick ticket. All bins that have been set up for other locations  (other than the logged in location) are displayed by default in this column.


You can include bins by highlighting the required bin in the **Exclude**  column and clicking the ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_exclude_button.gif) button. To include all the bins  click on the ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_include_all_button.gif) button.
