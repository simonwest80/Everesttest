Select this option if advance payment is received through a credit card  for the entire series of sales orders. This option is enabled when you  select the **Credit Card Payment** check  box. The entire amount received is treated as an advance from the customer.  When checked you will be prompted to enter payment details for the entire  series of recurring orders.

12 months, $10 each month, & $120 total.  $10 will then get applied to each individual recurrence.
