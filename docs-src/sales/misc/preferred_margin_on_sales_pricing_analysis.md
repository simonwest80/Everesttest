# Preferred Margin on Sales


Select the **Margin** option to  compute the profit as percentage of the sale price. The sales price and  profit is computed from the **Start Margin** specified.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If the  cost of an item is $100 and the **Start 
 margin** is 10%, and the **Margin 
 step** is 2%, the price of the item is first computed on the starting  margin of 10 %. The **Profit Breakup** browser  displays the selling price as $111.10 with a profit of $11.11. The next  sale price will be $113.63 with a profit of $13.63 and so on.
