**Do not verify CVV2 information**


Select this option if you do not want the message from the processing  network to provide the card verification result.


**Prompt if CVV2 does not match before processing  payment**


Select this option if you want to be prompted when the security code  verification number does not match with the address in the card issuer's  database.


**Prompt Always before processing payment**


Select this option if you want a message from the processing network  providing the verification result to be displayed always.


**Process payment and store CVV2 response**


This option allows you to send the entire  amount of the transaction for authorization and does not prompt irrespective  of whether or not there is a match between the security code provided  and the information at the cardholder's issuing bank. The CVV2 response  is merely stored in the transaction history.
