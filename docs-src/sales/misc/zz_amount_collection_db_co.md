title: Amount
---


This is the amount that you are collecting from the customer. You have  to enter the amount you are collecting from the customer. You cannot receive  an amount that is greater than the value of amount you refunded to the  customer.


{:.example}
If you have refunded an amount worth $1500  on the credit order and you have already collected $500, then the maximum  amount that can be collected is $1000.


If you collect a payment from a foreign currency customer, you cannot  enter an amount in this field. In this case, use the **Prior 
 Payments** tab to specify the amount of collection.
