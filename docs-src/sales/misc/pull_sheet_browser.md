# Pull Sheet Browser


The **Pull Sheet** browser displays  a list of the pick tickets that are generated. One pull sheet is created  for all the pick tickets generated. **Everest** automatically generates the pull sheet number. The pick ticket(s)  and the pull sheet are created simultaneously.


The **Pull Sheet** browser can be  sorted by any column in the browser. This browser allows you to specify  the quantity actually picked for shipping.


**Quantities  can be entered in this browser in the following ways:**

- Specifying  the quantity in the **Quantity Picked** column.
- Scanning the  items picked using a bar code scanner.



**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) The quantity  picked cannot exceed the quantity to be picked. The stock can be picked  only from the stock areas specified in the [**Stock Area Selection** section]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/stock-bin-selection/document_criteria_-_stock_area_selection_pick_ticket_wizard.html) of  the wizard.**


**Entering the Quantity Picked**


Entering the quantity picked is classified under the following:

- [Serialized  Items]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/pull-sheet/serialized_items_entering_qty_pull_sheet_browser.html)
- [Auto-serialized  Items and Non Serialized Items]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/pull-sheet/auto_serialized_non_serialized_and_non_inventoried_items.html)



**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)If you  do not want to enter the quantity to be picked at this stage and try to  close the **Pull Sheet** browser,  **Everest** asks if you want to close  the status of the pull sheet. Select **No**  to keep the status of the pull sheet open. You can enter the quantity  to be picked at a later stage.**


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/steps.gif)After entering the quantity picked, do the  following:

- Click **Options** > **Commit 
 Picked Quantities**. The picked quantity is committed on the sales  order and the **Committed** column  is updated.


- You can then  convert the sales order to an invoice by selecting the **Convert 
 to Invoice** option (path: **Pull 
 Sheet** browser > **Options**  > **Convert to Invoice**).



![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif) You  can also process the sales order to an invoice using the **Process 
 &gt; Invoice** option from the **Sales 
 Order** profile.

- Click **Continue** in the **Pull 
 Sheet** browser. You will see the [**Conclusion**]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/conclusion/conclusion_pick_ticket_wizard.html) section of the **Pull Sheet**.
