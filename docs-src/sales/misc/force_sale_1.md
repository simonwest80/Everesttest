**Force Sale**


Force sale is a transaction type in which a request is made to capture funds for an existing authorization. In case you have an existing authorization received over the phone or if you have made a request only for authorization, funds are merely blocked in the cardholder's account but cardholder is not debited. Force sale is a request to debit the cardholder and transfer the funds to the merchant account.
