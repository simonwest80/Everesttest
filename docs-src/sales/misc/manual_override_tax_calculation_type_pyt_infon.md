# Manual Override


Select this option if you want to manually change the tax code for the  line item. You can also change the tax amounts for tax codes that have  only one tax component.


When a new item is added to the document, the taxes are automatically  calculated based on the jurisdiction of the sales document.


If the tax code associated with a sales order is discontinued, **Everest** prompts you to select another  tax code when you try to edit this sales order or covert it to a sales  invoice.
