# Customer Information


**Customer Code**
: The **Customer Code** identifies the customer for whom the opportunity is created. You  can create several opportunities for each customer. The customer can be  an existing customer or a prospective one. If you are creating the opportunity  for a prospective customer, you must first create a customer account.

: When you access the **Sales 
 Opportunity** profile from within a sales quote, order or invoice,  this field displays the customer code for that document.


**Sales Rep**
: This field **** identifies  the Sales Representative responsible for the opportunity. The sales representative  assigned to the opportunity can be different from the default sales representative  of the customer.
: When a sales quote, order or invoice is created  directly, this field displays the sales representative for that document.  However, if the sales opportunity is converted to a sales quote by another  sales representative, the representative who created the sales opportunity  is displayed by default in the **Sales 
 Rep** field. You can change the sales representative for the document.


{:.note}
Sales commission is calculated on the basis of sales  invoices and not sales opportunities. The sales representative specified  in the sales invoice becomes eligible for the sales commission.
