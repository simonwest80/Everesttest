**Address Verification**


Address Verification Service (AVS)  is a service that verifies the cardholder's address in order to prevent  fraud in card-not-present transactions where the card holder is not present  during the transaction (e.g. mail order, telephone order, internet, etc.).  This address may be different from the customer's billing address. Address  verification is used only in the United States and addresses are verified  only for addresses located within the United States.
