# Analysis by Last Cost


When the analysis is by last cost, the current mark-up percentage and  the current margin is calculated using the selling price for the item  on the document and the last cost for the item.


{:.note}
If the option **Factor 
 Cost (enable cost inflation)** is selected in the **Other****Flow Control** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary**  tab), the costs are inflated by the factor percentage for the item. However,  if the user has logged into extended mode, the costs displayed will not  include cost inflation.


The last cost is computed per sales measure of the item.
