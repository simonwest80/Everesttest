# Shipment Tracking Information


Select this option to view the **Shipment 
 Tracking Information** browser.


{:.note}
You can access this option from the **Sales 
 Order/Invoice** browser and **** profile  (path: **Options** > **Shipment 
 Tracking Information**).


This browser allows you to enter the tracking number for the shipment.  The tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system using a bar code  scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered with different  delivery methods for each shipment. Your online customers can view the  tracking number entered in this browser.


The shipment date defaults to the login date and the delivery method  defaults to the document's delivery method. You can change these as required.


Use this browser when you ship items using multiple delivery methods.  If you ship the items using only one delivery method, you can enter the  shipment tracking number in the **Shipment 
 Tracking** field of the respective document's **** profile.


{:.note}
If you have created a drop-ship purchase order from  a sales order, the delivery method, the delivery date and the shipment  tracking number as entered in the drop-ship purchase


order are displayed in the **Shipment 
 Tracking Information** browser.
