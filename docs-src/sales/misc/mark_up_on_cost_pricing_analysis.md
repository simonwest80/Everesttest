# Markup on Cost


Select the **Markup** option to  compute the profit as a percentage on cost. The sales price and profit  is computed from the **Start Mark-up** specified.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the cost of an item is $100 and the **Start 
 markup** is 10%, and the **Markup 
 step** is 2%, the price of the item is first computed on the starting  mark - up of 10 %. The **Profit Breakup** browser displays the selling price as $110 with a profit of $10.  The next sale price will be $112 with a profit of $12 and so on.


{:.note}
The mark up on cost is computed per sales measure of  the item.
