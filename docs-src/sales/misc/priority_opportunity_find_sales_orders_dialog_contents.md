# Priority


Use this option to search for sales orders based on the priority defined  in the sales opportunity associated with the order. You can select multiple  priorities.


{:.note}
For sales orders created directly (without a sales opportunity),  priority is not assigned by default in the **Sales 
 Opportunity** profile. Unless you enter the priority in the **Sales Opportunity** profile, sales orders  are NOT displayed in the search result.
