# Sales Orders


The sales order (path: **Invoicing**  > **Sales** **Orders**  > **Options** > **New**  > **In New Window**) confirms the  customer's intent to purchase your items and services. It records the  description, quantity and related information for items and services that  the customer wants to buy. When you create a sales order, the opportunity  is marked as closed since the sale is now confirmed. It is only after  you receive an order (as recorded in the sales order) that you can supply  products and services to a customer.


The sales order is useful in the following  ways:

- Serves as an  authorization to sell.
- Maintains a  history of the orders placed and enables follow up negotiations with the  customer.
- Allows you  to issue goods for approval.
- Allows you  to receive deposits from customers.
- Enables you  to create tasks through the contact manager so that follow up action may  be taken.
