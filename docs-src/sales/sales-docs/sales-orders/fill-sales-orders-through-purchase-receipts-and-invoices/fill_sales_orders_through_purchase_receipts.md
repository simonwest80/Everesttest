# Fill Sales Orders Through Purchase Receipts and Invoices


**The **Fill 
 Sales Order** option in purchase receipts/invoices displays a list  of 'open' sales orders that can be populated using the items received  on the **Purchase Receipt/Invoice**.  When you select this option, a browser containing the items on the purchase  receipt/invoice is displayed depending on your selections in the **Parts Fulfillment** dialog box. The browser  also displays the sales orders that are open for those items, the quantity  the order needs and the number of units that can be fulfilled using this  purchase.**
