# Cancel a Sales Order


**You can cancel the sales order if there  is no sales process with the customer. The sales order is canceled using  the **Cancel Order** option from the  **Sales Orders** profile (path: **Sales Order** profile > **Options 
 &gt; Process &gt; Cancel Order**).**


**The following Sales Orders cannot be canceled:**

- A sales order  that is a backorder.
- A sales order  on which a deposit has been received.
- A closed sales  order.



**When you cancel the sales order, the system  converts it to a sales quote, irrespective of whether the sales order  is created directly or processed from a quote. The sales quote becomes  available again as a system document.**
