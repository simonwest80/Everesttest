# Processing Credit Card Payments


Credit card payments from customers can be processed from **Everest**  or processed outside **Everest**.  If you do not want to use **Everest**  to process certain credit card payments, set up your credit card payment  methods so that the **Use Payment Processor**  check box is not selected in the **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Method** profile **&gt; Options** > **New** >  **In New Window** > **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab).


Credit card payments that you accept from customers may be processed  using any of the following payment services that **Everest**  supports:

- ICVerify
- Payflow  Pro
- WorldPay



A credit card payment is automatically processed when you select the  **Use** **Payment 
 Processor** check box in the **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab.


Payment currencies supported


**Everest** currently supports all  currencies supported by the processor. You can specify the currencies  supported by the processor in the **Processors**  profile.
