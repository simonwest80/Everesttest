# Back End Processes - Pre-Authorization


The following back-end processes occur for credit card payments that  are received using the **Pre-Authorize** option:

- When an authorization  is obtained, its details are stored.
- The funds may  be captured for this authorization after delivery of items or services  by processing the authorization using the **Batch Payment 
 Processing** option (path: **Accounting 
 &gt; Account Receivable &gt; Batch Payment Processing**). If you  select the **Batch** **Processing**  check box in the **Receipt** dialog  box, you may capture funds later in batches.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana"> </font>
