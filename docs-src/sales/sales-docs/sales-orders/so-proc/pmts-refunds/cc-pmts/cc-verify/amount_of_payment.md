# Processing Amount


The value entered in the **Amount**  field of the **Receipt** dialog box  is the processing amount. The payment is processed in the currency specified  in the [**Pay in** field]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/payment_currency_exchange_rate_details_payment_dialog_sales_documents.html#pay_in_receipt_db) of the **Receipt**  dialog box (path: **Receipt** dialog  box > **General** tab > **Exchange** **Info**  tab).


If the payment is pre-authorized, the authorized payment is displayed  here when you enter the approval code in the **Use 
 Prior Authorization** section. You cannot edit this field.
