# Editing Payment/Refund Information


You can modify the payment/refund only from an unposted **Receipt****Journal**.


If any modifications are made to the receipt journal, the document payment  information is also updated. A receipt journal can also be voided. The  balance payable on the document then includes the amount of payment that  was voided.


You can reverse the payment received from a customer by using the **Refund** option on the **Sales 
 Order** or **Sales Invoice** profile  (path: **Options &gt; Payment &gt; Refund**).
