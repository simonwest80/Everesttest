# Voiding Customer Receipts and Refunds


Customer receipts and refunds are accounted in **Receipt 
 Journals**. Voiding the accounting entry for the receipt or refund  in the Receipt Journal deletes or voids the customer receipts/refunds.  You can void an accounting entry in any of the following ways:

- [Voiding  the journal from the receipts journal.]({{site.acc_chm}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/receipt-jrnl-proc/rcp-jrnl-purge-trans/voiding_receipts_journals.html)
- [Deleting  transactions from within the receipts journal]({{site.acc_chm}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/receipt-jrnl-proc/rcp-jrnl-purge-trans/purging-trans/deleting_transactions_receipt_journal.html).
- [Voiding  or voiding and recreating the transaction from the Payment Register]({{site.acc_chm}}/payment-register/wizard/browser/voiding-transactions-payment-register/voiding_receipt_refund_transactions_payment_register.html).
