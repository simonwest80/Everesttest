# Back End Processes - Refund on a Sales Order


When a refund is made against a sales order  the back end processes are:

- The customer's  unposted amount  as viewed in the **Customer** profile  increases by the amount of refund. The amount receivable (net balance)  from the customer also increases. When the payment journal for the payment  is posted, the unposted  amount reduces and the posted amount increases with the amount receivable  from the customer staying the same.
- The balance  amount on the sales order increases and the amount paid reduces.
