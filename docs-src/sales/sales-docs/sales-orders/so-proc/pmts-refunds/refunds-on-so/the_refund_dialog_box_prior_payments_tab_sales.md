# The Refund Dialog Box - Prior Payments


This tab is displayed when you make a refund on a sales order to a foreign  currency customer. If you receive advance payments from the customer (over  a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you to  specify the payment that must be applied as a refund.


This tab comprises two sections:

- **Advance 
 Document Available** - Displays all available deposits on the current  sales order. Available deposits are those that are not applied on a sales  invoice.
- **Advance 
 Document Applied** - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the > and >> buttons to move  the available deposits to this column. You can change the amount being  applied in the **Amount** column.



The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the **Amount**  field (path: **Refund** dialog box  > **General** tab).


When you refund a deposit, a transaction is automatically created in  a receipt journal.
