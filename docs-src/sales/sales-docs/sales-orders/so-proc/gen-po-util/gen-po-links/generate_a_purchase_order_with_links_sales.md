# Generate a Purchase Order with Links


If you do not have enough stock of the item while selling to a customer,  you can create a purchase order directly from the sales order. You will  receive the items from the vendor. Once you receive the items, you have  to ship the same to your customer. The purchase order is linked to the  corresponding sales order.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  have to sell 10 units of an item to a customer. While creating a sales  order, you realize that you have only 5 units of the item in stock. You  can then raise a purchase order for the item, immediately from the sales  order.
