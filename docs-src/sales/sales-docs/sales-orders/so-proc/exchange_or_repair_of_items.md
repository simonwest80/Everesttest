# Service Items


You can keep track of items that are received for service or repairs.  To do this, change the item type to 'service'.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you receive a music system for service, create a service order (alias  for sales order) and change the item type to service.


{:.steps}
To track items received for service and bill  for services rendered, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing** >  **Other** **Documents**  > **Sales** **Order**  > **Service** **Order**.  You will see the **Service Orders** browser.
- From the **Service Orders** browser, select **Options** > **New**  > **In** **New****Window**. You will see the **Sales Order** profile.



{:.hint}
If you have not created the document alias 'Service  Order', you  can create a sales order directly by selecting **Invoicing** > **Sales Orders**.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/lens.gif) [Create  a Document Alias]({{site.bp_chm}}/doc-aliases/create/creating_a_document_alias_businesss_process_in_everest_content.html)

- Retrieve the  item code into the document.
- Change the  item type to service by clicking the **Type** column for the line item and pressing the **Spacebar** key.
- [Attach/Commit  the items]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-ret-docs/cos/co-proc/cmt-items-to-co/attach-cmt-qty/attaching_committed_quantities_on_credit_order.html) returned for repair or service.



{:.note}
The serial number must be attached from the 'Out' type  of stock areas for items received from customers for service. These items  continue to be in the ownership of customers; hence, they are not added  back to your stock.

- When you have  completed the order, bill the customer by converting the order to an invoice.  You can charge the customer for the service either by entering a price  in the item's price column or adding another line item for service charges.



You can also generate serial numbers for service items that need to  be tracked from the **Sales Order**  profile (path: **Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve 
 Serial # &gt; Generate Serial #**).
