# Commit Items to a Sales Order


Inventoried items may be committed to a sales order in the following  situations:

- You physically  issue the items but do not remove it from total stock (i.e. transfer ownership)  until it is inspected and approved by the customer.
- You identify  and segregate the items that are to be shipped against a sales order.



You cannot commit items on orders belonging to discontinued customers.


**The **Committed**  column in the **Sales Order** profile  displays the quantity of the item that has been committed on the sales  order. Committed items on a sales order are recorded in an 'In type' of  **Stock Area**.**

**The quantity committed on a sales order  cannot exceed the quantity ordered. However, if the committed quantity  exceeds the ordered quantity, **Everest**  informs you of the same. You are prompted to confirm that you want to  proceed.**


If you choose to continue, the ordered quantity gets updated to equal  the committed quantity. This is applicable to all items - serialized,  non-serialized or auto-serialized.
