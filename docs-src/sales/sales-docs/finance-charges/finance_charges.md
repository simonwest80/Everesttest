# Finance Charges


The **Finance Charges** feature (path: **Invoicing** > **Customers** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window** > **Finance Charges** tab) allows you to apply finance charges on customer invoices that have not been paid even after the due date for payment. These charges appear on the customer statements and become a receivable from the customer.


Finance charges are automatically computed by the system. Charging finance charges is a two-step process:

- [Setting up finance charges information]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/finance-charges/set_up_for_finance_charges.html) on the **Customer** profile.
- [Processing the finance charges]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/finance-charges/processing-finance-charges/processing_finance_charges.html)
