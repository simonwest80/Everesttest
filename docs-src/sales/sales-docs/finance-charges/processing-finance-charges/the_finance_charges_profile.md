# The Finance Charges Profile


The **Finance Charges** profile  allows you to set the criteria for calculating and charging finance charges.


**Date**
: Specify the date up to which finance charges are  to be computed. This field defaults to the current system date.


**Compute Balance Based On**
: Select the documents that are to be included while  arriving at the outstanding balance due from customers. The **All 
 Documents** option is displayed by default in this field. The options  are:

- **All 
 Documents** - When you select this option, the balance due is arrived  at by totaling the customer's invoices and deducting the deposits received  on sales orders.
- **Invoices 
 Only** - When you select this option, the balance due is computed  as the sum of the customer's invoices only.
- **Invoices 
 and Credit Memos Only** - When you select this option, the outstanding  balance is computed by totaling the customer's invoices and deducting  the balances of the customer's credit memo(s).



**Customer From - To**
: Specify the beginning and ending customer codes  for whom the finance charges report must be generated. If these fields  are left blank all customers are included.


**Include Terms**
: Specify the document payment terms that are to be  included. Only five payment terms can be included at one time.


**Exclude Terms**
: Specify the document payment terms that are to be  excluded. Only five payment terms can be excluded.


{:.note}
You can only include terms or exclude terms. That is  you cannot include a few payment terms and exclude other payment terms  at the same time since these options are mutually exclusive.

 Charges Setup** browser]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/finance-charges/processing-finance-charges/finance_charges_setup_browser.html).
