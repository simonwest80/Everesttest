The payment term is specified in the **Sales 
 Order** profile in the **Terms**  field, while the payment term type is specified in the **Payment 
 Term Type** field of the **Payment 
 Term** profile (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Payment** **Terms**  > **Options** > **New**  > **In New Window**).


**Consider orders with credit card authorizations  as fully paid**
: Select this check box if you want **Everest**  to consider sales orders on which authorization for credit card payments  is received. You can capture funds for the sales orders from the **Pull Sheet** window.
