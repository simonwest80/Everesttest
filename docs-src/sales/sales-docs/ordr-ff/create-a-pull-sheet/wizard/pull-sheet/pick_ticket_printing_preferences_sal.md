# Print Pick Tickets - Printing Preferences


From the Pull Sheet, you can use the **Print 
 Pick Tickets** option to print selected pick tickets to show where  items that need to be picked are located in your warehouse.  Details  on the Pick Ticket report are sorted based on the warehouse position of  the stock bin where the items exist.


To do this, on the Pull Sheet, highlight the required pick tickets and  select the **Print Pick Tickets**  option (**Options** > **Print 
 Pick Tickets**) to print the pick ticket(s) associated with the pull  sheet. Items display in the order of the warehouse position and you can  distinguish inventory that has been previously committed.


You will see the **Printing Preferences**  dialog box. You can print the report by clicking the **Print**  icon.
