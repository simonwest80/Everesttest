# Pull Sheet Wizard - Sales Order Selection


This section allows you to define the sales orders  for which you want to generate the pick tickets.


{:.steps}
To select the required sales orders, do the  following:

- Click the **Select Sales Order** button. You will  see the [**Find 
 Sales Orders** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/so-selection/find-so-dlg/find-so-dlg/the_find_sales_orders_dialog_box.html).
- From the **Find Sales Orders** dialog box, specify  the required parameters and click **Find**.  You will see the [**Sales Documents** browser]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/so-selection/sales_documents_browser_pick_ticket_wizard.html).
- Select the  required sales orders and click **OK** to  return to the **Sales Order Selection** section  of the **Pull Sheet Wizard**.
- All the selected  sales orders are displayed in the **Sales 
 Order Selection** section.



When you open a document, it is locked so that other users cannot modify  it at the same time. You cannot therefore create a pick ticket for a document  that is already open elsewhere. If any documents are in use, **Everest**  informs you that another user has locked the document and asks if you  want to deselect  the document.


Click **Yes** to deselect  the document automatically. Click **No** if you wish to deselect  the document manually. If you do NOT want to generate the pick ticket  for any of the selected sales orders, deselect  the check box beside the **SO#**  column.


You can click the **Save Template**  button to save the created pull sheet as template. This button will be  enabled only when the Sales Orders have been selected.

Click **Next**.  You will see the [**Pick Ticket Browser**]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/ordr-ff/create-a-pull-sheet/wizard/pick-ticket-preview-browser/pick_ticket_browser_pick_ticket_wizard.html).
