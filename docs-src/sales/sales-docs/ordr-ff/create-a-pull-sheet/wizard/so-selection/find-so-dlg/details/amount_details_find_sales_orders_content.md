# Amount Details


The **Amount** tab provides you  with search parameters based on the amount fields in sales orders. This  tab comprises the following fields:

- Amount
- Paid  Amount
- Balance
- Taxable  Amount
- Tax  Amount
- Exempt  Amount
- Trade  Discount Amount
- Weight



{:.note}
The amounts in these fields are denoted in base currency  only and therefore, the search is carried out for amounts only in base  currency.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you have a foreign currency sales order of AUD  50 and the base currency amount is USD  25, you have to input 25 in the amount fields for your search.


If you specify an option in ONLY one of the fields, the search result  will yield all the sales documents that satisfy the criteria specified  in that field.
