# Find Sales Orders - Advanced Find


The **Advanced Find** tab facilitates  an advanced search by using conditions such as And/Or/Equal to.


You can specify multiple search parameters. This is a more complex option  than the other tabs in the Find Filters and is extremely useful to narrow  down your search to meet your requirements.
