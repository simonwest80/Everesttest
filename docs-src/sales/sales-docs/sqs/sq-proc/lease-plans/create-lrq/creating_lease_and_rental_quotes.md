# Create a Lease or Rental Quote


You may present a sales quote or a sales order as a lease or rental  quote by attaching lease plans to it. A lease/rental plan must be attached  to the sales quote or sales order from the **Lease/Rent 
 Plan Dialog box**.


A maximum of two lease plans can be attached to a sales quote - one  for a lease quote and the other for a rental quote.


{:.note}
Lease plans cannot be attached on a sales invoice.
