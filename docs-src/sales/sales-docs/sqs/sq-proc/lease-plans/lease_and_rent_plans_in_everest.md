# Lease and Rent Plans in Everest


A lease is a contract, granting use of item(s)  for a specified period in exchange for a specified sum of money. In **Everest**, the lease plan merely enables  you to view the amount of installments that the customer should pay. Receipts  or invoices for the amounts due are not automatically generated.


Having defined lease plans, you can create lease quotes or rental quotes  (path: Sales Document profile > **Options 
 &gt; Lease**).


Creating lease quotes enable you to inform your customer about the lease  installments that must be paid.
