# Lease Plans


A lease plan is a scheme offered by a leasing and finance company where  the buyer instead of purchasing a product, decides to take it on lease  by making periodic payments to the lessor. At the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to convert the lease into a sale or terminate  it.


The entities in a lease plan are:

- **The 
 Lessee** - The lessee is the customer who is taking a product on  lease. The customer instead of purchasing a product, leases it for a specified  period by paying periodic rentals. At the end of the lease period, depending  on the lease plan, the lessee may become the owner of the product.
- **The 
 Lessor** - The lessor is the leasing company that finances the lease.  The lessor buys the product from the merchant and leases it to the lessee.
- **The 
 Merchant** - The merchant sells the product to the leasing company  but ships it to the lessee.
