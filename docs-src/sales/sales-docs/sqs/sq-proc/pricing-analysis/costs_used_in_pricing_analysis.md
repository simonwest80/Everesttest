# Costs Used in Pricing Analysis


Pricing analysis analyses the selling prices of items in a sales document  in relation to its costs. The costs used for the analysis are listed below:

- [Average  cost]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/analysis_by_average_cost.html)
- [Last  cost]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/analysis_by_last_cost.html)
- [User  defined cost]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/analysis_by_user_defined_cost.html)
- Actual cost



These costs must be selected in the **Type 
 of cost to be displayed in Inventory Browsers, Stock Transfers, and Pricing 
 Analysis** option of the **Other Flow 
 Control** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control 
 &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary**). Select **All**  to view the analysis based on all types of costs and **None**  to disable pricing analysis.
