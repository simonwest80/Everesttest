# Maintaining Critical and Minimum Markup/Margin on Sales


You can ensure that the selling price of the item does not fall below  the critical or minimum margins or markup. The critical or minimum markup/margin  is specified in the **Pricing Analysis**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Pricing Analysis**).

The definition of minimum and critical markup/margin differs from company  to company. As a thumb rule, minimum margins/markup are set up to ensure  that the gross margin covers selling, distribution and operational costs.  The critical margins/markup are set up to ensure that gross margins cover  at least operational costs.


**[]()Type of Cost Used**


The cost used for margin/markup calculation is specified in the **Type of cost used for commission calculation**  field of the **Other** **Flow 
 Control** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control 
 &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary** tab).


Markup and margins are calculated using inflated cost if the option  **Factor cost (enable cost inflation)**  is selected in the **Other** **Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow 
 Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; Item Cost/Sales Summary** tab).


Only users with the required security right can create sales documents  with selling prices below either the critical or minimum markup percentages.
