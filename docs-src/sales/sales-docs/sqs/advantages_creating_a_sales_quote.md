# Advantages - Creating a Sales Quote


Although you can create a sales order without creating a sales quote,  the advantages of creating a quote are elucidated below.

- **Comparative 
 Analysis of Quotations made to Customers** - The sales quote records  customer information, product information, terms of the sale and other  details. This allows you to compare and analyze quotes.
- **Track 
 Sales Opportunities** - A sales quote is an opportunity for sales.  Creating sales quotes allows you to track sales opportunities from sales  quotes.
- **Record 
 Customer Negotiations** - You can record important points in the  sales quote that were brought up during customer negotiations.
- **Manage 
 Customer Contacts** - The sales quote is the basis for your negotiations  with the customer. It is very useful to have the details of a quote when  negotiating with the customer. The contact manager feature in **Everest** allows you to associate tasks and appointments with a specified  sales quote.
- **Minimizes Data Entry while Creating Sales Orders**<font color="#000000" class="hcp2"> - When a sales quote is converted to an order, the information 
 in the sales quote flows into the sales order thus reducing data entry.</font>
