# Back End Processes - Converting Sales Opportunity to Sales Quote


The following back-end processes occur when a sales opportunity is converted  to a sales quote:

- The **Opportunity 
 ID** number becomes the **Sales Quote** number since **Everest** puts  sales opportunities on par with sales quotes.
- You can no  longer view the sales opportunity from the **Sales 
 Opportunities** browser.
- All opportunity  details are carried over to the sales quote. You can access the **Sales Opportunity** profile by selecting  **Options &gt; Edit Opportunity**  from the **Sales Quote** profile.
