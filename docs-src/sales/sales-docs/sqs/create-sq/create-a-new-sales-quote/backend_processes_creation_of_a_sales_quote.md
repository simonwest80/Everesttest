# Back End Processes - Creation of a Sales Quote


When a sales quote is created, the following back end processes occur:

- The next sequence  number specified in the login  location or sub-location is assigned to the sales quote.
- If sequence  numbers are not defined for the login  location or sub-location, the sequence number for the default location  is used.
