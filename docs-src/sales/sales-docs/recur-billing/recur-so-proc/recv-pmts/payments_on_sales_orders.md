# Payments on Sales Orders


Customers often make deposits against the sales orders. You can receive  deposits against an order by selecting the **Receive**  option.


{:.steps}
To receive payments on a sales order, do  the following:

- From the **Sales Order** profile, select **Options 
 &gt; Payment &gt; Receive**. You will see the [**Receipt** dialog box]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/sales-orders/so-proc/pmts-refunds/pmts-on-so/rcpt-dlg/the_payment_dialog_box.html).



{:.note}
The **Receive**  option is enabled only on existing sales orders that have been saved.  On a new sales order the option will be available only when the sales  order is saved.


When you click the **Receive** option,  **Everest** checks if there are pending  transactions in the **Batch Payment Process**  browser (sale, authorization, pre-authorization and others) for that document.  If pending transactions are found, **Everest**  prompts you whether you want to process existing batch payment(s) or receive  new payment.


Selecting **Process existing batch payments**  option opens the **Batch Payment Process**  browser for processing the document.


To receive new payments, you should have appropriate security right.


{:.note}
The amount that you see in the message is the sum of  the value of all pending batch payments (sale, authorization, pre-authorization  and others) for the document.
