# Delink Recurring  Documents


Before the recurring sales orders are converted to sales invoices, you  can choose to break the document's link to the recurrence pattern. The  document is no longer displayed in the **Recurring** **Sales Orders** browser.

To break the sales orders link to the recurrence  pattern, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Sales 
 Orders**. You will see the **Sales 
 Orders** browser.
- From the **Sales Orders** browser, select **Options 
 &gt; Recurring Documents**.



{:.note}
Only recurring sales orders that have not been converted  to a sales invoice are displayed in the browser when this option is selected.

- Select the  document(s)  to be delinked.
- From the **Recurring** **Sales 
 Orders** browser, select **Options 
 &gt; Delink 
 recurring documents**.
- **Everest** asks if you want to delink  the selected document(s).  Click **Yes** to delink  the documents. Click **No** to cancel  the process.



{:.note}
Only the selected documents are not be linked. The remaining  sales orders in the series continue to be linked. Once a document's link  is broken, it cannot be linked once again to the series of recurring documents.
