# View Unprocessed Recurring Sales Orders


Unprocessed recurring sales orders are displayed in the **Recurring 
 Sales Orders** browser. Tasks are also created for each sales order  that has to be converted to an invoice. The **Contact 
 Manager** profile also displays information on the sales orders that  have to be processed.


You may keep a sales order pending while processing a subsequent one.
