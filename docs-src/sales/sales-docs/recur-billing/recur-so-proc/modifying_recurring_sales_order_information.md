If you modify a recurring sales order, you can also modify all future  documents in the series.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you change the item price on the fifth sales order in a series of 12 recurring  sales orders, you can choose to update the price change in the seven subsequent  sales orders.


When you modify the document, **Everest 
 ask**s if you want to similarly modify all subsequent documents in  the series. Click **Yes** to modify  all subsequent documents. Click **No**  to modify only the current document.
