![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  your base currency is the US Dollar, and the document currency is Great  Britain Pounds (GBP),  and the rate is expressed as 1 GBP  = 1.42064. Using the formula for quote type **foreign****to** **base,** 1000 GBP = 1000 x (1.42064/1) = 1420.64.


If the rate is expressed as 1 USD  = 0.703973 GBP,  then using the formula for quote type **base****to** **foreign,** 1000 GBP **=** 1000 x (1/0.703973)  = 1420.64.
