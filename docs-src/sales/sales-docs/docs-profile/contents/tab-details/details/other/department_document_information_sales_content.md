# Loc/Sub-Loc


The **Loc/Sub-Loc** field in a sales  document displays the location or the sub-location to which the document  belongs. When a quote, order or invoice is created the **Loc/Sub-Loc** field displays the location/sub-location assigned to the customer  in the **Loc/Sub-Loc** field (**Customer** profile **&gt; Miscellaneous** tab). If required, you can select a different  location or sub-location.


When you select a customer code for the document and if the location/sub-location  assigned to the customer is different from that in the document, the system  informs you of the same and asks you whether you would like to change  the location/sub-location.


{:.note}
When you assign a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of the sales documents by sub-location and print reports  for your management information purposes.

Processed Documents


When a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to an  invoice, the location/sub-location specified in the original quote or  order is displayed in the converted order or invoice. You can change the  location/sub-location for a sales document before you post the sales journal.


Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers


The document's location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Location/Sub-Locations do not have  separate sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected,  the address and logo of the sub-location's location is used.
