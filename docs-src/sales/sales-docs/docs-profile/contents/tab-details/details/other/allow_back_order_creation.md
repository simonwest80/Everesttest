# Allow Back Order Creation


The **Allow Back-Order** **Creation**  option is displayed only on sales orders. This option allows you to indicate  if the items on the order can be partially shipped.<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana"> </font>This option is selected by default if the  **Allow Back-Order Creation** check  box is selected in the **Customer**  profile (path: **Invoicing** >  **Customers** **&gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt;** **Miscellaneous**  tab).


If you clear this check box, the entire order must be converted to an  invoice; there cannot be partial shipments.
