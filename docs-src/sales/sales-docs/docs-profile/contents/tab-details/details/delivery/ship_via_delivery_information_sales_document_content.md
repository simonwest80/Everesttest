# Ship Via


The **Ship Via** field allows you  to specify the delivery method used for the shipment of the item. Whenever  a sales document is created, the default delivery method specified in  the **Delivery Method** field of **Customer** profile (path: **Invoicing 
 &gt; Customer &gt;** **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Miscellaneous**  tab) is displayed. You can select another delivery method if required.  Although the delivery method is a factor in computing sales tax, the tax  code applicable to backorders and fully shipped orders remains the same  even if you change the delivery method.

The delivery method is also used to:

- Estimate freight  due on the shipment (where the price quoted to the customer is inclusive  of freight).
- To track shipments.
