# Promotion Code


Promotions or promotional campaigns are methods by which you can increase  your sales. You can offer discounts or free gifts on certain items for  a certain period to attract more customers.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You can  offer 10% discount to customers who buy goods from Dec 15th to Jan 15th,  and also track expenses and revenues associated with the promotion.


Promotion codes help to keep track of revenues that occur because of  promotion campaigns. You may also want to track the source of a sale based  on promotion codes for the following reasons:

- To compute  the profits of printing a promotion campaign catalog.
- To gauge the  effectiveness of advertising and campaigns based on the source of sales.



A promotion code is defined in the **Promotion****Profile** (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Discounts &gt; Promotions** > **Options**  > **Edit** **&gt; 
 In New Window**).

Promotion codes can be associated with a special pricing that is defined  in the **Special Pricing Details** section  of the **Special Pricing** dialog  box. You can associate a promotion code to a special pricing by selecting  the **Promotion code required** check  box and specifying a promotion code in the **Promotion**  field of the **Special Pricing** dialog  box (path: **Inventory &gt; Discounts &gt; 
 Special Pricing &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**).

The **Promotion Code** field in  the sales document allows you to specify the promotion code to be applied  to the document. If you have specified a special price for the promotion  code in the **Special Pricing** dialog  box, and you select the promotion code in the **Promotion 
 Code** field, **Everest** asks  you whether you want to do the following:

- **Keep 
 the current prices** - If you select this option, the price of the  item will not change. You are Â allowed  to retain pricing on the document if you have adequate security rights.
- **Update 
 prices based on the new promotion** - If you select this option,  the price is recalculated based on the price specified in the **Special 
 Pricing** dialog box. The updated price for the particular item is  then populated in the **Item** **Price** column of the sales document.

If you select a promotion code that has expired, **Everest** informs you of the expired status  of the promotion code. You can apply this promotion code by selecting  **Yes** on the message.
