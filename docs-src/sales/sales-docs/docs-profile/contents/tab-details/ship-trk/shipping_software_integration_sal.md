# Shipping Software Integration


**Everest** has the ability to integrate  with common third party shipping software such as StarShip and UPS WorldShip.  This integration allows you to lookup shipping address details, print  tracking labels, assign shipment tracking numbers and calculate shipping  charges without having to re-key any data between the two systems.  The  result is less mistakes and significant time savings.


Follow the instructions provided by the shipping software provider to  integrate it with **Everest**.  Assistance  from **Everest Software** is also  available as a service. Contact your **Everest**  Account Manager for more information.
