# Discount % and Discount Value


<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">The discount % and discount value for the matrix 
 item is calculated in the same manner as regular items.</font>


Quantity and other discounts apply to individual matrix items, and not  to the sum of quantities of items in the matrix.


**![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  a matrix group consists of 25 items, a discount of 5% would be applicable  to each of the items and not to the matrix group.**


**You can change the  discount value or the discount %.**


{:.note}
You can enter either the **Discount****%** or the **Discount****Value**. If you specify the **Discount** **%**  the **Discount** **Value**  is automatically calculated and vice-versa.
