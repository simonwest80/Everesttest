# Retrieving Kits


If an item kit is retrieved, the item codes of all  the kit components along with their respective prices are added to the  Item Details Grid. The prices displayed in the sales document depends  on the settings specified in the **Details 
 &gt; Pricing** tab of the **Kit**  profile.


If you select the option **Reset item 
 prices to zero and display the total price of the kit on a total line**  (path: **Item profile &gt; Details &gt; 
 Pricing** tab), the prices of individual items in the kit are displayed  as zero. If you replace an original item with a related item, the negative  or positive price differential, or the actual price of the related item  is displayed in the **Item Price**  column of the document profile. The total price of the kit also changes  accordingly.
