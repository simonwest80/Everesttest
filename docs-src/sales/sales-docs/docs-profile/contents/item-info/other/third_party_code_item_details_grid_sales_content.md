# Third Party Code


The **Third-Party Code** column  displays the third-party item code as defined in the **Item 
 Code** field of the **Third-Party**  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Third-Party** **Catalogs**  > **Options** > **New**  > **In New Window**). The code  is displayed only for items from third-party catalogs that are sold on  your **Everest eStorefront** store.


This column does not have any value for sales documents that are not  raised from your **Everest eStorefront**  store.
