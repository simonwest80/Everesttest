# Job Code


The **Job Code** column displays  the job to which the revenues and expenses for the line item in a sales  document must be allocated. All open jobs are available for selection.  If required, you can assign different job codes to different line items  in a sales document.


{:.steps}
To assign a job code to a line item, do the  following:

- Place your  cursor in the **Job Code** column  in the Item Details Grid **** of a  sales document and click **Enter**.  You will see a drop-down ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_drop_down_arrow.gif) arrow.
- Click on the  drop-down ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_drop_down_arrow.gif) arrow, you will see a list of job codes. Select  a record and double-click.



**Everest** validates the job code  before assigning it to a line item. The following validations are carried  out:

- [Verification  of the job code for the selected customer]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/verification_of_the_job_code_for_the_selected_customer_sales_doc.html)
- [Verification  of expired/closed job codes]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/verify_expired_closed_job_codes_sales_doc.html)
- [Verification  of job codes when a new line item is added to an existing sales document]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/verify_job_code_when_a_new_line_item_is_added_to_an_existing_document_sales_doc.html)
