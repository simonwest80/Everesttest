# Picked


The picked column is displayed only in sales orders. The check box in  this column is selected when a pick ticket has been created for the particular  line item of the sales order.


When you open a sales order that contains a picked item, **Everest** asks you to confirm that you want to edit the sales order. If you  click **Yes**, the sales order is  de-linked from the Pull Sheet. Thus you can edit a sales order that contains  a picked item, only when you want to break the sales order's link to the  Pull Sheet, i.e., the sales order will no longer appear in the pull sheet.


This column is automatically deselected  when the pull sheet created for the sales order is manually closed or  is automatically closed by committing all the required items on the pull  sheet.
