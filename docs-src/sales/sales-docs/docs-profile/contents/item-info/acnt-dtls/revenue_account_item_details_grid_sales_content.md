# Revenue Account


The **Revenue 
 Account** column displays the account to which the sale proceeds  of the item are credited. The revenue account is credited with the sales  value (the selling price multiplied by quantity).


The revenue account for the item is determined by the following rules:

- The account defined  for sales revenue in the **Revenue**  field of the **Item** profile (path:  **Inventory &gt; Items** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window** >  **Accounts** tab) is automatically  populated in this column.
- If the sales revenue  account is not defined in the **Item**  profile, it is specified in the **Revenue**  field of the item's **Category** profile  (path: **Inventory &gt; Categories**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Accounting** tab) is assigned.

- If it is not defined  in the item's **Category** profile,  the sales revenue account in the **Sales**  field specified in the **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Revenue Accounts**  tab) is assigned.



{:.note}
You can select any other revenue account for the item  in the specified line. You cannot, however, select any of the accounts  specified in the **Control Accounts**  tab of the **Accounting**  dialog box.
