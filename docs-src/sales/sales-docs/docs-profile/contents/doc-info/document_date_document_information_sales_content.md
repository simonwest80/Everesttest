**The date displayed in a sales quote/order/invoice  is the date of creation of the document.**


**If an opportunity is converted to a quote,  a quote is converted to an order, or an order is converted to an invoice,  the date displayed on the quote, order or invoice is the login  date on which the document was converted. You cannot change the date on  the document once it is saved.**
