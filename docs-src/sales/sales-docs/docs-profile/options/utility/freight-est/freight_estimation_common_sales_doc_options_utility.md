# Freight Estimation


**Everest** allows you to compute  freight using the [**Everest**  Freight Estimator.]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/sales-docs/docs-profile/options/utility/freight-est/everest-freight-estimator/everest_freight_estimator.html) ****


Freight is computed on an item only if you select the **Include 
 in freight calculation** option in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Items** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window &gt; Sales** tab).


{:.note}
You may include freight in a sales invoice even after  saving it. However, you cannot modify a sales invoice whose journal has  been posted.


You can use an external utility to compute shipping charges on your  sales documents. When you open one such document and if you select the  **Prompt** option as a preference  in the **Prompt method for adding shipping 
 charges calculated by an external program** field (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts 
 &gt; Sales Documents &gt; Sales Documents 2** tab), **Everest**  prompts you to confirm if the freight amount must be updated. If you select  **Automatic** in the **Prompt 
 method** **** **for adding 
 shipping charges calculated by an external program** field, freight  amount is automatically updated on the document when the sales order/invoice **** is **** opened**.**
