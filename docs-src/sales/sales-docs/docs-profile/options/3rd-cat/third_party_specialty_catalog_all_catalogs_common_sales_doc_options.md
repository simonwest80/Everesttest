# Third Party Catalog - All Catalogs


Using the **All Catalogs** (path:  Sales Document profile **&gt; Options &gt; 
 Third-Party Catalog &gt; All Catalogs**) option, you can sell an  item present on a third-party catalog on behalf of the vendor. Items contained  in a third-party catalog do not exist in the **Everest**  database.


{:.steps}
To sell an item present on a third-party  catalog, do the following:

- From the Sales  Document profile, select **Options &gt; 
 Third-Party Catalog &gt; All Catalogs**. You will see the **Third-Party 
 Catalogs** browser displaying all the third-party catalogs that have  been created.
- Select **Options &gt; View**. **Items**.  You will see the **Items** browser  listing all the items contained in the third-party catalog.
- Select the  item you want to add to the sales document and click **OK**.



{:.note}
To select more than one item, press the **Shift 
 + Down Arrow** keys.

- The selected  item/s are added to the sales document.



If the model specified for a third party item retrieved on a sales document  is the same as the model of any item that exists in the database, **Everest** retrieves the item that exists  in the database.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  retrieve a third party item called HP Printer whose model is HP DeskJet  895. However, an item called HP DeskJet Printer of the same model exists  in your company's database. Everest retrieves the item HP DeskJet Printer  into the sales document.


{:.note}
You can specify the model of an item in the **Model**  field of the **Item** profile (path:  **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; General** tab).
