# Multimedia Browser


The **Multimedia** **Browser**  option (path: Sales/Sales Return Document **** profile > **Options** >  **Document** > **Multimedia 
 Browser**) brings up the **Multimedia 
 Setup** browser. This browser lists all the files attached to the  sales/sales return document. You can also attach new files from this browser.  The multimedia files can be in any format such as text files, image files  or video files. Individual files may be selected for viewing. Use the  program associated with that file type in the **Windows 
 Explorer Folder** options to open the file.
