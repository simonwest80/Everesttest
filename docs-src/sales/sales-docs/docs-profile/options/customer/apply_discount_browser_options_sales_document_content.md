# Apply Discount


The discount amount and the discount percentage can be changed from  the Item Details Grid (if you choose not to use the default discount scheme  pertaining to the item and customer). To revert to the default discount  method, use the **Apply Discount**  option (path: **Sales Document** profile  > **Options** > **Customer**  > **Apply Discounts**).


{:.note}
When you select **Apply 
 Discount**, discounts are re-calculated for all items in the document  and this replaces all modifications made to discounts.
