# Transaction History


**Everest** records the entire history  of a transaction beginning from the inception (sales quote), to the payment  on the final document. You can view the **Transaction 
 History** browser from any of the following locations:

- From the Sales  Documents browser by selecting **Options** > **Transaction History**.
- From the Sales  Document profile by selecting **Options**  > **Transaction** **History**.



**The **Transaction 
 History** browser displays the following:**

- Details of  sales quote creation such as date and time of creation, amount of document  and the user who created the quote.
- Details of  sales order creation, such as date and time of creation, amount of document  and the user who created the order. The profit made on all the items on  the document is displayed if items are committed on the order.
- Details of  sales invoice creation such as date and time of creation, amount of document,  user who created the invoice, and the profit made on all the items on  the document.
- Details of  payments or deposits received and refunded on the document such as the  payment type and reference number. Details of payments that are applied  to the document are also displayed.
- If payment  is received or refunded through a credit card, the card number, address  verification details, batch processing details and the authorization responses  are also displayed.
- If payment  is received or refunded through a credit card, the card number, address  verification details, batch processing details and the authorization responses  are also displayed. Credit card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).
- Details of  modifications made to documents such as changing the status of the sales  order, changes in the customer contact and shipping addresses, change  in the document alias, payment terms, delivery method, location/sub-location  and jurisdiction.

 history for documents** in the **Documents** dialog box (path: **File** >  **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Documents** > **Miscellaneous**  > **Others** tab).
