# Sales Commission Calculations


**Commissionable/Non-commissionable  Revenues**


Revenues can be classified into commissionable  and non-commissionable.  This helps you in computing the commissions to be given to the sales staff  at the end of a period. The **Include in 
 commission report calculation** check box and the **Commission 
 Rate %** in the **Item** profile  (path: **Inventory** > **Items** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Sales** tab)  facilitate in doing this.


The **Commission Report** calculates  the commission that must be given to the sales representatives for the  sales made by them.
