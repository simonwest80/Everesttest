# Accounting Entry for Non-inventoried Items


The accounting entry for non-inventoried items varies depending on the  following:

- [Where  the item has an asset account defined]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/where_the_item_has_an_asset_account_defined.html)
- [Where  the item has an expense and liability account defined]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/where_the_item_has_an_expense_and_liability_account_defined.html)
- [Where  the item has an expense account defined]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/misc/where_the_item_has_an_expense_account_defined.html)



{:.note}
In a sales invoice, accounting entries for the cost  of a non-inventoried item are created only when you define both an expense  and a liability account for the item.
