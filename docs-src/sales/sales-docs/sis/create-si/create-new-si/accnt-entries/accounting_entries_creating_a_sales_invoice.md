# Accounting Entries - Creating a Sales Invoice


When a sales invoice is created, entries are made in the Sales Journal  to account for the revenue, sales discount, sales tax, and expense for  cost of goods sold.


**Everest** splits the revenue and  cost of goods sold into commissionable  and non-commissionable  based on whether the item is subject to sales commission. It also splits  revenues into taxable and non-taxable based on whether sales tax is payable.


The entry type in the sales journal distinguishes the commissionable,  taxable, non-commissionable  and non-taxable amounts.
