# Discontinue a Reason Closed Group


When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a reason closed group, do  the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **** **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup** **&gt; Reason Closed**. You will see the **Reason****Closed** **Setup**  browser.
- From the **Reason** **Closed****Setup** browser, highlight the reason  closed group that has to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  The record that was selected is no longer visible in the **Reason****Closed** **Setup**  browser.



{:.note}
When you discontinue a reason closed group, the selections  under this group will also be deactivated from the **Reason 
 Closed Setup** browser.
