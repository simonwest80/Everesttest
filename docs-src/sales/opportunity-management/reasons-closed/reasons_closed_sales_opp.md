# Reasons Closed


Keeping track of the reason due to which an opportunity is closed enables  you to track the reasons for success or failure in converting potential  sales. You can define:

- [Reason  Closed Groups]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reason-closed-group/create_a_reason_closed_group_profile.html)
- [Reason  Closed Choice]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/opportunity-management/reasons-closed/reason-closed-selection/create_a_reason_closed_selection_profile.html)



{:.note}
A sales opportunity may be closed because the customer  finds the product too expensive. You can then create a reason closed group  called 'Financial' and the corresponding selection for the group can be  called 'Beyond customer's current budget'.
