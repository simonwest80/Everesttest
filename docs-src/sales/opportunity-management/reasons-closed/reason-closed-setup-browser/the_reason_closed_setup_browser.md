# The Reason Closed Setup Browser


The **Reason Closed Setup** browser  (path: **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Reason Closed**) displays  all the reason closed groups and the corresponding reason closed choices  that are defined under each group.


The browser displays the **Rank**  column. The rank identifies the hierarchy of the reasons for closure.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  "Customer not Interested" is the reason why opportunities are  closed most frequently, you would define its rank as 1.


Use the **Up** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_up_arrow.gif) and  **Down** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_down_arrow_button.gif) arrows to  change the rank of a reason for closure.


Options common to all browsers are also available in this browser.
