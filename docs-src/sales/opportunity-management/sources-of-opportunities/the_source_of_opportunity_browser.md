# The Source of Opportunity Browser


The **Source of Opportunity** browser  (path: **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Source**) displays all  the sources that are defined.


This browser contains the **Rank** column.  The rank identifies the hierarchy of the sources.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  Direct Mailer were the most important method of generating opportunities,  you would define its rank as 1.


Use the **Up** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_up_arrow_icon1.gif) and  **Down** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_down_arrow_icon1.gif) arrows to  change the rank of a sales stage.


Options common to all browsers are available in this browser.
