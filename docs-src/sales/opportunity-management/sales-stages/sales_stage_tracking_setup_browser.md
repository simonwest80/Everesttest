# The Sales Stage Tracking Setup Browser


The **Sales Stage Tracking Setup** browser  (path: **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup &gt; Sales Stage**) displays  all the sales stages that are defined.


The browser contains the **Rank**  column. The rank identifies the hierarchy of the sales stages.


![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If Initial  Contact were the first stage, its rank would be 1.


Use the **Up** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_up_arrow_icon1.gif) and  **Down** ![]({{site.sp_baseurl}}/img/sales_down_arrow_icon1.gif) arrows to  change the rank of a sales stage.


Options common to all browsers are also available in this browser.
