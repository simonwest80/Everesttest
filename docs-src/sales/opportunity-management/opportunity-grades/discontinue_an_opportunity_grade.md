# Discontinue an Opportunity Grade


When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.


{:.steps}
To discontinue an opportunity grade, do the  following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup** **&gt; Grade**. You will see the **Opportunity****Grade** browser.
- From the **Opportunity** **Grade**  browser, highlight the opportunity grade that has to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  You will see the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK**. The record that was selected is  no longer visible in the **Opportunity****Grade** browser.
