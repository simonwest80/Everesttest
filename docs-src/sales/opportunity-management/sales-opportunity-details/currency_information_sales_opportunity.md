# Currency Information - Sales Opportunity


**Currency**
: This field denotes the currency in which you raise  an invoice. This is automatically picked up from the **Customer** profile (path: **Invoicing &gt; 
 Customers &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Accounting**  tab). If the customer's currency differs from your base currency, you  must also enter the foreign exchange value for the opportunity and the  exchange rate on the date of creation of the opportunity.


**Exchange Rate**
: The latest exchange rate for the customer's currency  is displayed in this field. You can edit this field. **Everest**  determines whether the Buy Rate/Sell Rate should be used depending on  the setting in the **Rate for Sales Documents**  field (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences 
 &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Multicurrency &gt; Exchange Rates**).  You can edit this field.

{:.note}

**Forex  Value**
: Enter the value of the opportunity in the foreign  currency. This is translated into the base currency using the exchange  rate specified. The value thus computed is displayed in the **Value** field in the **General** tab.
: Where the sales quote, order or invoice is created  directly, this field displays the value of that document in the customer  currency.
