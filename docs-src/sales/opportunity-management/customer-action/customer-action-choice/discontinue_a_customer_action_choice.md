# Discontinue a Customer Action Choice


When you discontinue a record, it is temporarily unavailable for selection.  The record is not deleted from the database; it is merely deactivated.  A discontinued record can be made available for selection by reactivating  it.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a customer action choice,  do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **CRM 
 &gt; Opportunity Management &gt; Setup** **&gt; Customer Action**. You will see the **Customer****Action** browser.
- From the **Customer** **Action**  browser, highlight the customer action choice that has to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  The record that was selected is no longer visible in the **Customer****Action** browser.
