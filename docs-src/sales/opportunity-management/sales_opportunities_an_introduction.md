# Sales Opportunities - An Introduction


Prospective customers and the value of sales expected are tracked in  **Everest** using the **Sales 
 Opportunity** feature. Creating sales opportunities (path: **Invoicing** > **Sales****Opportunities** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window**) helps you track the stage in which each opportunity  is, its probable value and expected date of closure.


Effective sales management requires that the leads that are converted  into opportunities are evaluated and tracked.


Tracking sales opportunities helps you do the following:

- Estimate the  cash value of future inflows.
- Evaluate the  cash benefits and effectiveness of different sales and marketing channels  such as the Web, newspapers and magazines.
- Evaluate the  effectiveness of sales personnel.
- Manage customer  contacts.
- Analyze the  percentage of opportunities converted to orders, deals lost and the reasons  thereof.
