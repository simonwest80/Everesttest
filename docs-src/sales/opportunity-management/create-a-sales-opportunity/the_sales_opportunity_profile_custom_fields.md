# The Sales Opportunity Profile - Custom Fields


The **Custom Fields** tab allows  you to define additional information for any record as per your requirement.  Custom fields can be defined as character strings, or date, logical, memo  or numeric fields. This **** tab is  displayed only when you save the profile.

You can create a 'character' type custom field, called  'Special packing for long distance customers'.


You can create a 'character' type custom  field to track the contract type in the case of service opportunities  such as yearly, monthly or quarterly.
