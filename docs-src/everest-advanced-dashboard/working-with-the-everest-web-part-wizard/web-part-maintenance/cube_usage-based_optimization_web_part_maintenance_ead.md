# Cube Usage-Based Optimization


For maximum performance of your dashboard web parts, you should optimize  your cubes periodically to improve the query performance of your web parts.  Â This should  be done more frequently if your users continually request new queries.


{:.steps}
To perform Cube Usage-Based Optimization,  do the following:

- From the Windows  Start Menu, select **Programs** >  **Microsoft SQL Server** > **Analysis Services** > **Analysis 
 Manager**.
- Expand **Analysis 
 Servers** in the tree view to view the cubes.
- Right click a cube  and select **Usage-Based Optimization**.  The Usage-Based Optimization Wizard is displayed.
- Follow the directions  in the Usage-Based Optimization Wizard to optimize query performance for  the cube.
- Repeat this procedure  to optimize each of your cubes.
