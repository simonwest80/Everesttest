# Analysis Services


If you are an advanced user, you can use **Microsoft 
 SQL Server 2000/2005 Analysis Services** to further increase the  capabilities of your data warehouse and dashboard. Although this is beyond  the scope of this documentation, you can:

- Add Cubes
- Add Dimensions
- Add Named Sets
- Add Calculated  Members
- Add Cube Roles  (Provides field level security using Windows authentication)



Cubes built for the data mart are the data source for the dashboard  web parts. You can add cubes that are not created by default for your  data warehouse and view additional information in your **Everest**  data warehouse. Most importantly, you can create dimensions from your  custom fields. For more information, see the Analysis Services Books Online  and [www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com).


{:.note}
Cube customizations are not maintained during  migration. We recommend that you back up your customizations before installing  a new version of **Everest**.
