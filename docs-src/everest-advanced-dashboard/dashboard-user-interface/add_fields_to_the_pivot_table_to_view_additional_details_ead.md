{:.example}
After adding the **Media 
 Type** field to the pivot table, the sales per customer is now broken  down by sales per media type per customer. You can see how much of the  store sales for customer Wildon Cameron resulted from In-Store Coupons.  More importantly, you can see which media types are most effective for  each of your customers.


{:.note}
For best results, limit your field additions  to one or two fields per axis at a time.
