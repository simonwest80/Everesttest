# Tasks Dialog Box


Use the **Tasks** dialog box to  change how your tasks are viewed on your Tasks web part. You can toggle  the list between sort by due date then priority or sort by priority then  due date. You can define if the web part includes completed tasks and  if it should display the **% Complete**  column.
