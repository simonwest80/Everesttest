title: Rebuild result set cache every ____ minutes
---


Enter the number of minutes to wait until the cached result set expires.  Lowering this setting decreases the age of the data in your web parts  but it also increases the queries to the cube which can lower performance.  If your business does not require frequent updates to your dashboard web  parts, it is better to increase the time between rebuilding the results  set cache. Â The  default setting to rebuild the result set cache is every 120 minutes.
