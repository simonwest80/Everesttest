# Dashboard Analytics


One of the following four dashboard options is available in **Everest**  depending upon whether or not you have an activation key.

- **None** –  If you do not enter a key, the **Everest**  desktop displays a blank page.
- **Basic**  – If you enter a key for the **Basic**  option, the **Everest** desktop displays  the current **Everest** desktop.
- **Professional**  – If you enter a key for the **Professional**  option, the **Everest** desktop displays  the **Everest Advanced Dashboard**.  This option enables the creation, population, and maintenance of the sales  data mart and default cubes. It also enables the creation of the default  dashboard site populated with the default web parts. Users will be able  to create, maintain, and customize the dashboard. The **Professional**  option provides the following features:

 - **Data Warehouse 
 Dialogs and Menu Options** – Data warehouse configuration along with  status, history, and error information
 - **Sales Data 
 Mart** – Database tables for sales transactions and related data
 - **ETL**  – Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of the sales data mart populates  and maintains the data
 - **Default OLAP 
 Cubes** – Set of OLAP cubes created using **Microsoft 
 SQL Server 2000/2005 Analysis Services** subsequent to the population  of the data mart
 - **Default Dashboard 
 Web Site** – Dashboard web site
 - **Everest Web 
 Part Wizard and OLAP Tool** – Tools to create Business Intelligence  web parts for presenting information from the **Everest**  Data Warehouse.
 - **Default Web 
 Parts** – Web parts created and published on the default site as  part of the default dashboard view.
 - **Task and 
 Events Web Parts** – Web parts created display **Everest**  tasks and events as part of the original **Everest**  desktop view.

- **Enterprise**  – If you enter a key for the **Enterprise**  option, the **Everest** desktop displays  the **Everest Advanced Dashboard**.  This option has the same features as the **Professional**  option plus it provides permission to create customized cubes, data marts,  views, and lists from the **Everest**  Database or Data Warehouse.
