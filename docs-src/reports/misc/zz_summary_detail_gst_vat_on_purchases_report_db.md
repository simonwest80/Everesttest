title: Summary/Detail
---


This option allows you to specify whether you want to see a summarized  or detailed report of the taxes. In both report types the dates are organized  as indicated in the Grouped By option. Select **Summary**  to see just the tax totals for each date. Select **Detail**  to display the tax details for every item contained on each purchase or  purchase return document.


Because manual documents do not include line items, the Detail report  represents the tax values of manual documents using the **Item 
 used for displaying manual documents in tax reports** setting (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Items**).
