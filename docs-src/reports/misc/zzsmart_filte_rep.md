title: Smart Filter
---


Use the **Smart Filter** to select  accounts based on your segments. Wildcards can be used in this field and  up to 250 characters can be entered. **Segment 
 Separators** must be entered between segments because accounts can  contain fewer characters than the segment length. Enter a semi-colon (**;**) to separate accounts in the **Smart Filter**.
