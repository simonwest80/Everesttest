# Printing Reports


Printing reports is a simple process in **Everest**.  Reports print in letter size format. Â If  you use A4 paper, use a printer that will scale in order to ensure that  your reports print correctly.

The following procedure is detailed utilizing  the **Customer List** report as a  sample. You can similarly export other **Everest** reports.


{:.steps}
To print reports in Everest, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Reports &gt; Masters 
 &gt; Customer List**. You will see the **Customer 
 List** dialog box.
- Define parameters  for the selected report type.
- Select a printer,  from the **Printer** drop-down list.
- Click **Print**.



{:.note}
- The **Printer**  field is disabled if you select **Low Speed****C****onnection**  in the **Workstation Settings** dialog  box (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Workstation****Settings** > **General**  > **General Settings** tab). Only  your default printer is available for printing.

- Sales and purchase  documents can be printed either from the **Reports**  menu or from within the document.
