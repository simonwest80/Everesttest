{:.example}
While accounting for GST on a non-cash basis in Australia, you can claim  input tax credits (GST credit on Purchase) when your supplier has issued  an invoice or when you have paid them, whichever is earlier.


However, if an advance is paid against  a purchase order during a reporting period and the items are not received  (i.e., the purchase order is not converted to a purchase receipt), the  input tax credit on this purchase order cannot be claimed in that period.
