title: Document Dates
---


You can filter the report to see only those sales documents created  on a certain date or period. Selecting any option here except **All**,  automatically populates the **From**  and **To** fields, with the date range.  You can edit the **From** and **To** fields only when you select the option  as **Custom**. When a specific date  range is selected, then only those documents whose document date lies  in the above selected date range is included in the report.
