title: Print Serial Discrepancy Details
---


Discrepancies for serialized and auto-serialized items occur for the  following reasons:

- Serial numbers  present in the system are not available physically
- Serial numbers  available physically are not present in the system



For serial numbers to print in this report, they must be present somewhere  in the system. If the serialized items are available in the system but  are not physically present in the stock bin, they display as “Unmatched  Serial # from system” in the report. If the serialized items are available  physically in a stock bin which is different from the stock bin in the  system, they display as “Unmatched Serial # from phys. Count” in the report.


To print such serial numbers, select the **Print 
 Serial # Discrepancy Details** check box. For auto-serialized items,  serial numbers along with manufacturer’s serial numbers are printed.
