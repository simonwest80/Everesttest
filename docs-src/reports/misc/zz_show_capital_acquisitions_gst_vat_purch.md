Select this check box to display tax details for capital acquisitions  in the report. The system considers any account in the items detail grid  defined as a Fixed Asset account (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting**  > **Posting Group** tab) a Capital  Acquisition.


The report lists the Capital Acquisition accounts first and lists all  other accounts under “Other Acquisitions.”


If this check box remains unselected, only tax details for purchases  not considered Capital Acquisitions display in the report.
