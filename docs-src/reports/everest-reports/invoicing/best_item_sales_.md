# Best Item (Sales)


The **Best Item (Sales)** report  provides an analysis of best items sold by your company during a particular  time period. Best items sold may be:

- Items with  the maximum sales (in quantity).
- Items that  generate the maximum revenue.
- Items that  generate the maximum profit for you.



The report is grouped by the item sales measure and displays details  such as item code and description, quantity (sold), revenue, cost and  profit on the item sales, and the cost per unit.


The net revenue displayed = total sales value - value of total sales  return (during the selected period).
