# Accounts Payable Aging Report


Use the **Accounts Payable Aging**  report to view an itemized list of your outstanding payables along with  payment details for each outstanding document. This report helps you to  make payment decisions and to determine your cash flows.


The report displays the following:

- Vendor Account  Name, Code and Vendor Balance (in base or vendor currency).
- Details for  posted or both posted and unposted documents, filtered for all or a specific  vendor and purchase representative, depending on the parameter preferences.
- Details of  all document types outstanding such as purchase orders, purchase invoices,  debit orders and debit memos for both system and manual documents depending  on the parameter preferences.
- Details of  vendors for whom you have outstanding balances.
- Details of  each payment including the Payment Date, Payment Method and Reference  # if any, depending on the parameter preferences.
- Displays Credit  Limit, Invoice/PO #, Rep, and On Hold columns. If the vendor is marked  as **On Hold** in the **Vendor**  profile, this will be indicated with an asterisk mark.
- Advances against  purchase orders/ debit orders depending on the parameter preferences.  Debit orders are displayed in the report only if any advances have been  made against them.
- Amount paid  and the Outstanding Balance.
- Aging details  using either the due date or the document date. For multiple payments  against the same purchase order, all amounts falling in the same time  bucket are summed and displayed in the respective time bucket as a negative  amount.
