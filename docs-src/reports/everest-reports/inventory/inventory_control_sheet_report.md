# Inventory Control Sheet Report


**Inventory Control Sheet** report  lists inventoried and serialized items grouped by category/brand/stock  area based on the option selected in the parameter dialog box. The report  is used to compare the physical stock in your warehouse with the total  stock quantity in **Everest**, and  can be an excellent source of information during inventory audits.


The report displays the following details:

- Item code selected  in the parameter, filtered for the stock area (bin) and location.
- The “Stock” type  of areas and “Bin” type of areas. The report is generated for the selected  bins filtered for the selected locations.
- The lot numbers  of the serialized and inventoried items. This will be blank if the lot  numbers are not assigned.
- The total stock  for the selected bin and the selected lot number. If an item is inventoried  or serialized but not tracked for lots, only the total quantity in that  bin is displayed.
