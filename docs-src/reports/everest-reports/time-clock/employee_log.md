# Employee Log


The **Employee Log** report displays  essential employee attendance information such as the number of hours  worked, time in/out, time in/out variance, shift offsets, and holidays.


This information is beneficial for conducting employee appraisals, and  tracking and improving employee efficiency in your organization. You can  use this report to track time in and time out variances for each employee  for a specified shift. This report provides key employee attendance details  in either a Summary or Detailed format. You can create an Employee Log  summary report that shows the number of hours worked per day along with  the total and average hours worked for the period. You can quickly determine  the number of employees who have worked less than a specified number of  hours or have left early on a particular day. You can also view a detailed  report that includes all in and out times for an employee throughout the  work day.


![]({{site.rpt_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) If a  user does not have a default shift specified, time in/out variance is  calculated using the default shift specified for the company (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Other Defaults &gt; Default Shift Code** field). If a default  shift is not specified for a user or the company, the time in/out variance  is not calculated or displayed.
