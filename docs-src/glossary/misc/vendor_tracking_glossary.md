**Vendor Tracking**


<font color='black'>Vendor tracking can be used to track your vendors by a variety of ways. For example, vendors</font> could be tracked by the type of products or services they provide, whether they are a 1099 vendor, what type of vendor they are (retail, distributor, independent consultant) or any other group that is meaningful for your company.
