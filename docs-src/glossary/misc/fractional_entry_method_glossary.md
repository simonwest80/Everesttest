**Fractional Entry Method**


The fractional entry method allows you to express measures as whole numbers and fractions of the whole. For example, if a sales measure is a quintal and a quintal comprises 100 kilograms, quantities can be expressed only in terms of quintals and as fractions of the quintal.  Quantities such as 3 quintals, 10 kilograms and 300 grams cannot be expressed through fractional entry.
