General Ledger


The general ledger is a summary of totals by journal for each chart  of account. The general ledger reflects a separate account for each kind  of asset and liability, and for equity as well as for revenues and expenses.  Normally asset and expense accounts will have debit balances, whereas  liability, revenue and equity accounts will usually have credit balances.
