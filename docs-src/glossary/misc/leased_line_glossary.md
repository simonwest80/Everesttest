**Leased Line**


A permanent telephone connection between two points set up by a telecommunications carrier. Typically, leased lines are used by businesses to connect geographically distant offices. Unlike normal dial-up connections, a leased line is always active. The fee for the connection is a fixed monthly rate, which varies depending on the distance between end points and the speed of the circuit.
