**Auto-serialized Inventory Item**


Auto-serialization allows **Everest**  to automatically select a random serial number from inventory to assign  to an item at the time of sale.


This type of serialization is generally used when the item is always  purchased from a single source and no warranty information is received  from the vendor.
