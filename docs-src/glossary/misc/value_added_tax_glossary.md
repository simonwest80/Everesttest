**Value Added Tax (VAT)**


Taxes that are paid only on value addition to an item.  Value added tax is an indirect tax on consumer expenditure. Unlike a retail sales tax, VAT is charged and collected at each stage of the production process and not only on the final sale. VAT is normally borne by the consumer in the price paid for goods and services. It is also charged on business transactions.
