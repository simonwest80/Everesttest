# Top Ten Purchase Vendors 


This section displays the top ten vendors against whom the maximum value  of purchase invoices have been generated for the current month, previous  month, and the year-to-date, after accounting for the debit memos raised  in the same period.


The top ten purchase vendors section displays two columns:


| **Vendor** | Lists the names of vendors |
| **Amount** | Net Purchase Value = Purchase Invoice Value - Debit Memo Value |

**Everest** identifies the top ten  vendors based on the highest total of net purchases and lists them in  the descending order even if the net purchase amount for a vendor is negative.


Employees set up as vendors in **Everest**  are not included.
