# Toolbars


Toolbars provide quick access to commonly used menu options. The Toolbars  allow you to organize options in **Everest**  the way you want, so that you can find and use them quickly. You can add  and remove menus and buttons, create your own custom toolbars, hide or  display toolbars, and move toolbars.
