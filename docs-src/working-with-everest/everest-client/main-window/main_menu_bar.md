# Main Menu Bar


The main menu bar is a special toolbar at the top of the window that  contains menus such as **File**, **Inventory**, **Purchasing,**  and **Invoicing**. The drop-down menus  that are displayed when any of the main menus are clicked are called **submenus**. You can customize the main  menu bar as per your requirements.
