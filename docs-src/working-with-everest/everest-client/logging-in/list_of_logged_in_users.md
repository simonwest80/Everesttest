# List of Logged-in Users


You can obtain a list of the users who have logged into **Everest**  by clicking on the **User Count**  icon on the [**Status 
 Bar**]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/everest-client/main-window/status_bar.html).


When you click on the **User Count** ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/users icon.gif) icon, the [**Logged-in Users** browser]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/misc/the_logged_in_users_browser.html)  is displayed.


{:.note}
The **Multiple Companies** option  allows you to license more than one company inside **Everest**  with a single set of registration information. If you purchase this option,  there is no limit on the number of companies you can create in **Everest**.  All the companies will be working off of the same user license count,  and you can log in to the companies in any combination you want as long  as you do not exceed the user count of your license.


The user count icon displayed in the status bar shows the total number  of logged-in users for all companies but clicking on it will display the  **Logged In Users** browser, which  shows only those users who have logged in, to the logged-in company.


{:.example}
Company X and Y are part of the multiple companies with a 50 user license.  40 users have logged into Company X and 10 users in to Company Y. **Everest** displays the user count as "User  50/50" on the status bar of both the companies, but clicking on it  will show the logged in users of the logged in company only.
