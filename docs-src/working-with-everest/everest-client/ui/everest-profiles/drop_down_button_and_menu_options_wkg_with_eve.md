# Drop-down Button and Menu Options in Everest Profiles


The drop-down button ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_drop_down_button.gif) is displayed beside most fields in  **Everest**. Click this button to  view a drop-down list of related records. You can select the required  record from this list.


**Search By <Parameter>**


Some drop-down lists contain many records and provide a **Search 
 By** feature. To search for a record in the list, use the **Search 
 By &lt;parameter&gt;** field. Click a column header to search by  that parameter.


{:.example}
In the Customer profile, **Sales 
 Person** field, click the **Last Name**  column header to **Search by Last Name**.

**Figure: Click a Column Header to Search by that  Column**


In the **Search By &lt;parameter&gt;**  field, start typing the beginning characters of what you are searching  for. When you locate the record in the list, double-click the record to  place it in the original field.


{:.example}
A sales manager wants to select a new sales  representative in the Sales Person field of a Customer profile but does  not know the sales person Code. The Sales Manager clicks the **Last 
 Name** column header to **Search by 
 Last Name** and starts typing the last name of the Sales Rep, in  this case “f” (for Fox) in the **Search 
 by Last Name** field. The Sales Manager then double-clicks the record  for Vivian Fox when it is in view to make the selection in the **Sales 
 Person** field.

To start a new search, click on the column header of the parameter to  use for the search and start typing in the **Search 
 By &lt;parameter&gt;** field to locate the record. Alternatively,  you can delete the characters in the **Search 
 By &lt;parameter&gt;** field and start typing in the **Search 
 By &lt;parameter&gt;** field again to locate a different record.
