# Customize Browsers


As in the case of the main menu bar and toolbars, you can also change  the appearance of browsers to suit your requirements.


{:.example}
You can create a new toolbar containing only  those options that you frequently use to speed up working with **Everest**.

{:.example}
Say, you want to highlight the columns in  your **Sales Orders** browser. You  can change the font colour and size for the column headers. You can also  export the data with these settings to a HTML file for MIS  presentations.


In addition, you can:


**Display menu options as icons or text or both**


You can display the shortcuts to options on Toolbars as icons or text  or both.


{:.steps}
To display options as text or icons, do the  following:

- Click the ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_drop_down_button.gif) icon on any of the toolbars or on the main menu bar and select  **Add or Remove Buttons**. You will  see a drop-down menu listing all the menus in **Everest**.
- Select **Customize**. You will see the **Customize**  dialog box.
- Right-click  on the required option in the browser toolbar.
- From the drop-down  menu, select **Default Style** to  view the option on the toolbars as an image only. Select **Image 
 and Text** to view the option on the toolbar as an image alongside  the name of the option.



{:.note}
The **Text 
 Only (Always)** and **Text Only (in 
 Menus)** options displayed in the right-click menu for an icon are  obsolete and should not be used.
