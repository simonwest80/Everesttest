# Where can we use barcodes?


The **Label Designer**  in **Everest** can create barcodes  for any fields available in browsers.


This includes fields visible in the browsers and those fields  available in the Field Chooser, such as **Vendor 
 Part #** which is available in the Field Chooser from the Items profile.


Common places where users print barcodes are Purchase Receipts,  Items and Advanced Query browsers.


{:.note}
If you want to use fields from the Field Chooser  in your label design, you must add the fields to the browser before opening  the Label Designer so that they will be available for your label designs.
