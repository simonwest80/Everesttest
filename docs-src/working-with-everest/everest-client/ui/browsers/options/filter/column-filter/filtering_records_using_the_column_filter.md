# Filter Records Using the Column Filter


Filtering is a quick way to find a subset of data in a browser. A filtered  browser displays only those records that contain the value you specified.


{:.example}
You can filter the **Sales 
 Invoice** browser to display only those invoices that were created  by a particular sales representative.


{:.steps}
To filter a browser using the column filter,  do the following:

- From the required  browser select **Options &gt; Properties**.  You will see the **Browser Property Editor**.
- From the **General** tab, select the **Show 
 column filters** check box.
- Click **OK** to return to the browser. You will  see arrows to the right of the header columns in the browser.
- To filter the  browser for a particular value, click the arrow in the required column  header and select the value from the drop-down list.
- You can apply  additional condition(s)  to other column(s)  based on the value selected in the previous column by repeating the last  step in the other column(s).



{:.example}
After  filtering the browser for a particular sales representative, you can further  filter it for the sales invoices that have an outstanding balance of more  than $10,000.


The filter arrows in columns that have selected values are blue. You  can filter values in more than one column at the same time.


{:.note}
When records are filtered using the column  filter, **Everest** displays the details  of the filter above the browser's status bar.


{:.example}
If the **Amount**  column in the browser is filtered for amounts above $1,000 the browser  contains the following message![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_column_filter_message.gif). Click on **X**  to clear the filter that has been applied to the browser.
