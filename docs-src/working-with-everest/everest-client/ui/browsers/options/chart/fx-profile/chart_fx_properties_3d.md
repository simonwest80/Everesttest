# The Chart FX  Properties Dialog Box - 3D


This tab allows you to rotate the chart interactively by clicking and  dragging a specific marble around the two intersecting plates. The Preview  on the right side displays the rotation angle you have chosen for the  chart.


**Rotated View**
: Select this check box to activate the 3D rotated  view for a 3D chart.


**X Angle**
: Use this option to rotate the plot area around the  X-axis. The rotation is measured in degrees. The rotated view box must  be checked before applying the X-axis rotation.
: Click and drag the <font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000;">Red</span><span class="hcp1"> </span></font>spot, to alter the 'top/bottom  view' – X Angle. This is similar to holding an object in your hand and  looking at it from the top or from beneath - vertically rotating the item.


**Y  Angle**
: Use this option to rotate the plot area around the  Y-axis. The  rotation is measured in degrees. The rotated view box must be checked  before applying the Y-axis  rotation.
: Click and drag the **Blue**  spot to alter the 'base view' – Y  Angle. This is like placing an object on a flat rounded base and spinning  the base, in any direction - horizontally rotating the item.


**Shadows**
: Use this option to choose a specific rendering method  for a 3D chart. By default, the colored marker will use a fixed-angle  method to achieve a color degradation, which will display a more realistic  effect in a 3D chart.


**Depth**
: Use the slider in the **Depth**  selector to specify the depth of a 3D chart relative to its width.


**Perspective**
: Use the slider to set the ratio of the front to  the back of the chart. It ranges from 0 (default) degrees to 100 degrees.
