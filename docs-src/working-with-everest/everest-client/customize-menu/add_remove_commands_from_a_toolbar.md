# Add/Remove Commands from a Toolbar


**You can add an option to a toolbar in two ways:**

- Add a new command  to a toolbar OR
- Display a hidden  command on the toolbar.



{:.steps}
To add a new command to a toolbar, do the  following:

- Right-click  on any of the toolbars and select **Customize**  from the drop-down list. You will see the [**Customize** dialog box]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/misc/customize_dialog_box.html).
- Select the  **Commands** tab. The main menus and  toolbars of **Everest** are listed  on the left side under the **Categories**  panel and options for each menu are listed under the **Commands**  panel.
- Select the  required menu from the **Categories** column.
- Select the  option that you want to include in the toolbar from the **Commands** column.
- Drag and drop  the option onto the toolbar.



{:.steps}
To display a command that is hidden on a  toolbar, do the following:

- Ensure that  the **Enhanced** or **Flat** option is selected as the **Bar 
 Style** in the **Workstation Settings** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Current Environment Settings** >  **General** tab).
- Select the  drop-down icon ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_drop_down_icon.gif) from the required toolbar.
- From the drop-down  list, select **Add or Remove Buttons**.  All commands that are included in the toolbar are displayed with a check  mark beside them.
- Select the  command to be displayed on the toolbar.



Similarly, to hide a command, ensure that the command is not checked  in the drop-down list.
