# Filter Name


While creating a filter, you can choose the name that most closely describes  your search. You can save the filter and store them in **Everest**.  You can access this filter whenever you want information using the parameters  stored in the filter.


{:.example}
Create a filter for **Contact Manager 
 &gt; Find Tasks/Appointments** from the main menu. Save the filter  by name ‘Find Pending Tasks’ using ‘pending’ and ‘tasks’ as the parameters.


Choose the filter from the drop-down list. The **Find 
 Task/Appointment** dialog box gets populated automatically with all  the parameters saved earlier. You can choose to modify or add to the existing  parameters.


{:.steps}
To run a filter, already created in Everest,  do the following:

- From the main  menu, click the **Filters** ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/wwe_filters_menu_icon.gif) icon. You will see the [**Filters Drop-Down Menu**]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/misc/filters_drop_down_menu_options.html), containing  the filter options.



{:.note}
Filters can also be accessed from the drop-down  main menus that they belong to.
