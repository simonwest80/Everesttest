# Exporting a Company


The **Export Company** (path: **File** > **Export 
 Company**) option in **Everest**  helps you to set up a new company by exporting the default database settings  of the existing company as a template database to be used to create a  new company. The **Export Company**  option can be used to achieve the following:

- Speeding up the  new company setup process
- Allowing resellers  to create a default company to be used for a specific market
- Avoiding recreation  of same information to each customer
- Increasing productivity  and decreasing implementation cost
- Facilitating franchisers  to create the base default database for all franchises
- Creating a company  with similar capacity and settings to the existing one
- Exporting the default  database



{:.steps}
To export the default database settings,  do the following:

- From the main menu  bar, select **File** > **Export 
 Company**. You will see the **Export 
 Everest Company** window.
- Specify the name  of the file to be exported and the location.
- Click **OK**.  You will see the message, ‘Company export successfully completed’ on completion  of exporting process.



{:.note}
- While exporting  the default settings of the existing company (Template Company), the Forms  Designer table data, Interface Settings table data and any customizations  made to database objects will be retained.
- The exported company  database will be stored in .ECD file format.
