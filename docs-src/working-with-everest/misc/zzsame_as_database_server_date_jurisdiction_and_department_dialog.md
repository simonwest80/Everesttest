title: Same As Database Server Date
---


Select this option to ensure that all entries are as per the database server date. If this option is not selected, users from different time zones may login using different dates and transactions created at the same time could have a different date because of the time difference. When this option is selected, you are not allowed to specify a login date. The database server date is displayed by default in this field.
