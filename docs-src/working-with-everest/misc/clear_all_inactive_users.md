# Clear all inactive Users


Use this option to clear all inactive users from **Everest**.


**Everest** checks for all the inactive  users by default, and releases the locks on inactive users. This is a  back-end process which occurs every 180 seconds.


{:.example}
You are working on a document and your system  crashes, you have to start **Everest**  again. During this period another user would like to work on the same  document that you were working on. Since your system has crashed and you  cannot work on the document, this document will be available for the other  user to work on. This is possible when you click on the option **Clear 
 all inactive users**.


{:.steps}
To clear all inactive users, do the following:

- From the **Logged-in Users** browser, select **Options** > **Clear 
 all inactive Users**. This option will identify all inactive users  and clear them.
