# Dimensions


The **Dimension in** field allows  you to choose the unit of measurement for specifying the dimensions of  the label. The following measurements are available:

- Centimeters
- Inches
- Points
- Twips
- Pixels



When you choose one of these measurements, the **Margins**,  **Layout** and **Pitch** fields get automatically populated in that measurement type depending  upon your selection of the dimension group.


Dimensions define the size of the label. The following can be defined:

- **Margins** – Enter the distance you want between the left and top edge of  the page and the label.
- **Layout** – Enter the width and height of each label.
- **Pitch** – Enter the vertical and horizontal gap between the labels.
