title: Skip Labels
---


Specify the number of labels to be skipped when printing commences.  This option is useful when you have a partially used page of labels. This  helps you save stationery.


{:.example}
If you have a page of label stickers on which  the first five stickers were used while printing labels earlier, specify  5 in the skip labels field. When you do so, the next print run will begin  printing labels from the 6th  sticker onwards.
