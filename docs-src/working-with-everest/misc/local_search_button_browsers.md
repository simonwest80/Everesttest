# Local Search Button


This button ![]({{site.wwe_baseurl}}/img/local search button.gif) enables you to perform a quick search for  any record (not just displayed records) from the browser.


Turn **ON** the local search feature  in a browser and enter a relevant value (based on the parameter you are  searching by), in the **Search by &lt;parameter&gt;**  field. **Everest** searches the records  and brings up the matching records.


Turn **OFF** the local search feature  and enter a relevant value (based on the parameter you are searching by),  in the **Search by &lt;parameter&gt;**  field. **Everest** searches all the  records in the browser and brings up the matching records.


{:.note}
You can enter a partial parameter value in the **Search 
 by &lt;parameter&gt;** field. The records that match the partial  value are retrieved and displayed.


{:.example}
To search for a customer “Ray”, whose record is not displayed in the  browser, click the Local Search button **OFF**.  Type “RAY” in the **Search by &lt;Account 
 Name&gt;** field. **Everest**  searches the entire customer database and highlights the first customer  whose account name starts with the above letters.
