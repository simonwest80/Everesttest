title: Field Chooser
---


The **Field Chooser** displays a  list of all the columns available in the browser that you accessed the  label designer from. The first four fields, namely **Company 
 Code**, **Company Name**, **Location/Sub-Location Code**, and **Location/Sub-Location Name**, in the **Field Chooser**, are permanent. Â Multiple  copies of any of the data fields or bar codes can be added. Objects can  be added to the label by just clicking and dragging the object from the  **Field Chooser** to Label design  area**.**


{:.note}
Only the columns shown in the browser are  displayed in the **Field Chooser**.  If a field you need is missing, you must close the **Label 
 Designer** dialog box, add the missing field to the browser and reopen  the **Label Designer** dialog box.
