title: Delimiter

Delimiters mark the beginning/end of a unit of data. Delimiters are  specified only if the data is exported to a Text file.


Specify the marker that has to be suffixed to each field in the output  text file.


{:.example}
If the symbol '{' is specified as the begin marker and '}' as the end  marker when you export data from the **Customers**  browser, the output will be as follows:


'{Account}{Account  Name}{Location/Sub-Location}{Sales Person}{CompanyName}'
