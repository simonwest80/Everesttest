# Page Setup


**Options**


**Separate Legend**
: Select this check box to print the legends on a  separate page.


**Use printer resolution**
: Select this check box to use the resolution of the  printer and not that in the chart.


**Force colors**
: Chart FX  will automatically detect if the default printer is a color printer. If  it is a color printer, the chart will print in color; if not, the chart  is printed in B&W  hatched patterns.
: The default setting of this property is FALSE. This  means, Chart FX  will automatically print hatched B&W  patterns when the printer does not support colors. This improves the chart's  readability when printed. This behavior is particularly useful as you  do not need to preset specific patterns to the series if the target printer  is a B&W  printer.
: When this property is set  to TRUE, and the target printer is a B&W  printer, the printer driver will match the chart colors to a specific  gray scale pattern (not hatched). In some cases, the results are not desirable  and will make the chart printout impossible to read.


**Preview pane**
: The pane on the right side of the dialog box shows  how the page layout will look. As you change the options, the page layout  example changes.
