# Send Messages


**Everest E-Mail** allows you to  send e-mail messages, by clicking the **Send**  button in the **New Message** window.  However, if you are not connected to the Internet, these messages are  stored in your outbox.


{:.steps}
To send messages, do the following:

- From the **Everest E-Mail** menu, select **Tools**  > **Send**. Unsent messages stored  in your outbox  are delivered.



{:.note}
The sent items are stored in the **Sent 
 Items** folder. When you send messages using any other e-mail client  configured on your system, it does not show up in the **Sent 
 Items** folder of **Everest E-Mail**.  But if you send messages using **Everest 
 E-Mail**, it shows up in the **Sent 
 Items** folder of other e-mail clients configured on your system.


You need to be connected to the Internet to send messages stored in  your outbox.
