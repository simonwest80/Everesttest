# Find E-mail - Advanced Find tab


This tab facilitates an advanced search and you can specify multiple  search parameters. This is a more complex option than the other tabs in  the **Find** filters, and is extremely  useful to narrow down your search to meet your requirements.


When you choose parameters in any of the tabs, (such as **Quick 
 Find**), and click the **Find**  button, the find condition is automatically displayed in this tab.


You can specify advanced conditions to search out for mails that match  your condition.


{:.steps}
To create an advanced find filter, do the  following:

- From the **Advanced Find** tab, select <Click  here to add condition>. You will see a new condition added.
- Click the underlined  condition (e.g. Look  In), you will see a drop- down list.
- Select the  condition you want to apply from the drop-down list.
- Click **&lt;?&gt;** and type the condition string  to be filtered. Click **Enter**.



{:.note}
You can add multiple conditions and modify them by clicking <Click  here to add condition>.


You can also select or deselect queries in the **Advanced 
 Find** pane by selecting or deselecting  the query check box.


{:.example}
If you want to search for messages you have  received from Steve, you need to create a query **From**  in **Steve**.


Click **Find** to view the messages  that match your condition.
