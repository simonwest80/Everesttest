**Server Time-outs**
: Server time-out specifies how long **Everest 
 E-Mail** should wait for the mail server to respond when it attempts  to send or receive mail. Set this to a larger time when you have a slow  connection to the Internet or if your servers are very busy.


Sending


**Break apart messages larger than**
: Displays the maximum size of the message (in kilobytes)  that you can send. Messages larger than this size will be split and sent.


Delivery


**Leave a copy of messages on Server**
: Check this option to leave a copy of your messages  on the mail server, after **Everest E-Mail**  downloads your mail.

**Remove from server when deleted from ‘Deleted  Items'**
: Check this option to permanently delete messages  from the **Everest** database and  the mail server.
: To enable this option, you must select the **Leave a copy of message on server** check  box.
: If you do not select the **Remove 
 from server when deleted from ‘Deleted Items'** check box, the messages  deleted from the ‘Deleted Items’ folder are stored in the mail server;  however, they are not displayed in any folder on the **Everest 
 E-mail** window.
: It is recommended that you select the option to  avoid the likelihood of deleted messages being downloaded from the mail  server into the inbox.


**Get headers only**
: E-mail headers provide you with information such  as, the route a message took to reach your e-mail account, origin of the  message, what e-mail client was used to send it, etc.
: Check this option to enable headers to be part of  the message sent or received.
