# Server Timeouts


Server time-out specifies how long **Everest 
 E-mail** should wait for the mail server to respond when it attempts  to send or receive mail.


{:.example}
If you set the time-out to a small value (30  sec.) and your server takes two minutes, you will not be able to send  or receive any mail because **Everest E-mail** will stop the attempt before the server responds.


When you have a fast connection and your servers usually respond quickly,  you can reduce the time-out specified<font style="font-family: Verdana;" face="verdana">.</font>


{:.hint}
Drag the scroll bar to set the server time-out  interval.
