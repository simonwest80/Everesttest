# Check Names Dialog Box


When there are similar names in your address book, clicking on the **Tools &gt; Check Names** option brings  up the **Check Names** dialog box.  When selected, the dialog box displays the matching names in the address  book. You can select the appropriate name (or e-mail ID) to whom you want  to send mail.


{:.example}
You have 'Mary John' and 'John Fredericks' in your address book. When  you type 'John' in the **To**, **Cc** or **Bcc**  fields of the message window and select the **Check 
 Names** option, the dialog box will display both 'Mary John' and  'John Frederick' along with their respective e-mail ID's.


If you misspell a name or type a name which is not present in your address  book, and then select the **Check Names**  option, **Everest E-Mail** does not  recognize it and the dialog box displays "No Suggestions".


**Properties**
: Selecting this option displays the name, server,  and e-mail address for the name selected in the Change To section.


**Show More Names**
