**Leave a copy of message on Server**


Check this option to leave a copy of your messages on the mail server,  after **Everest E-Mail** downloads  your messages.


{:.note}
Some items or folders may not be recoverable  because the period for which mails are stored on the server is set by  your administrator.


**Remove from server when deleted from ‘Deleted  Items'**
: Check this option to permanently delete messages  from the **Everest** database and  the mail server.
: To enable this option, you must select the **Leave a copy of message on server** check  box.
: If you do not select the **Remove 
 from server when deleted from ‘Deleted Items'** check box, the messages  deleted from the ‘Deleted Items’ folder are stored in the mail server;  however, they are not displayed in any folder on the **Everest 
 E-mail** window.
: It is recommended that you select the option to  avoid the likelihood of deleted messages being downloaded from the mail  server into the inbox.

- Click **Next**. You will see the [New  Account Wizard - Exclude Address]({{site.eml_baseurl}}/misc/new_account_wizard_e_mail_exclude_list_mapi.html) section.
