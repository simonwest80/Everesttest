# The Settings Dialog Box - E-mail  Server


This tab allows you to configure the settings required to log on to  the mail server from where you are linking e-mails.


**Profile Name**
: By default, the drop-down list displays the user-profile  name that has been defined for Outlook.  You can select the user name in this field.


![]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  Microsoft Outlook is your local mail client and the name defined for the  user profile is Jason Matthew, the drop-down list will display the name  ‘Jason Matthew’.
: You can specify only one user profile in this field.


**Mailbox**
