# Files in Use Dialog Box


We recommend that you close all other programs on your workstation,  while installing **Everest**. This  minimizes the risk of installation errors. The **Files 
 in Use** dialog box lists the programs running on your workstation.  You can:

- Shut down these  programs and click **Retry**, to continue  installation.
- Click **Ignore**, **** if you want to continue installation without shutting down these  programs.
- Click **Exit** to stop the installation.



Once installation is completed, you will see the **Installation****Wizard** **Completed**  dialog box.
