# Link Existing E-mails


You can link e-mails  that you have received at an earlier date as ‘tasks/e-mails’  as specified in the **Settings** dialog  box.


Linking existing e-mails  is a two-step process. You have to:

- [Retrieve  e-mails]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/existing-emails/retrieve_e_mails_into_everest_mailbridge.html)  from your local mail client, into **Everest** and then
- [Add  the retrieved e-mails]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/existing-emails/add_the_retrieved_e_mails_into_everest_mailbridge.html)  to **Everest**
