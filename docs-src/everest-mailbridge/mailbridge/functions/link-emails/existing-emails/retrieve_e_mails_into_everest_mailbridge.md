# Retrieve E-mails  into Everest


There may be mails that you have:

- Received at  a date prior to the set up of **Everest 
 MailBridge**. ****
- Sent to/received  from Outlook,  while not logged on to **Everest MailBridge**.



You have to first retrieve these mails by processing them, before you  can link them to **Everest** as ‘tasks/e-mails’.


{:.steps}
To retrieve e-mails,  do the following:

- Once you have  logged on to **Everest MailBridge**,  right-click on the ![]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/img/mailbridge_everest_mailbridge_icon.gif) icon on the status bar of your desktop  and select **Process E-mail**.  You will see the [**Process E-mail**  window]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/existing-emails/process-email-wnd/process_e_mail_window_mailbridge.html).
- From the left  panel, select the folder that contains the e-mails  you want to retrieve. All the e-mails  are retrieved into the **Process E-mail**window **** in the right panel.



{:.note}
You can click the ![]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/img/mailbridge_cancel_button.gif) button in the status  bar, to stop the process of retrieving e-mails.
