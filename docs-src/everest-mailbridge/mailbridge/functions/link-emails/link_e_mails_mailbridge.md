# Link E-mails


Using **Everest** **MailBridge**,  you can:

- [Link  existing e-mails]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/existing-emails/link_existing_e_mails_mailbridge.html)
- [Link  new e-mails]({{site.mb_baseurl}}/mailbridge/functions/link-emails/link-new-mails/link_new_e_mails_mailbridge.html)



{:.note}
When **Everest**  links e-mails,  the time that the e-mail  was sent and received is saved in GMT. Â These  times are resolved into the time and date of the login  time zone of the user and displayed. For existing mails that are processed,  the time when the e-mail  is linked, is displayed.
