# View Linked Mails as `E-mails'


If you have configured **Everest****MailBridge**  to link mails as ‘e-mails’  in **Everest**, all linked e-mails  are displayed in the **My E-mail/All 
 E-mail browser**.


{:.steps}
To view mails that are linked as ‘e-mails’  in Everest, do the following:

- From the **Everest** main window, select **Invoicing 
 &gt; Customers &gt; Options &gt; E-Mail 
 &gt; All E-Mail/My 
 E-Mail**.  You will see the **My 
 E-mail/All 
 E-mail**<font color="#000000" class="hcp6"> browser</font>.



If you link e-mails  from/to entities other than your customers, they can be viewed in the  **Everest** **E-mail**  window (path: **CRM 
 &gt; Everest E-Mail**).


{:.note}
You can view the name and e-mail  ID of the sender of the e-mail.  You can do this by opening the e-mail  and right-clicking on the senders name beside the From field and selecting  **Properties**  from  the drop-down list.
