# The Reporting Preferences Dialog Box - Export Settings


Use the **Export Settings** tab  to set global report default settings. Settings made in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab > **Report 
 Settings** tab) override this selection.


**Global Reports Repository**
: Specify the location of your global reports repository.  **Everest Reports** reside in, and  are accessed from this location.


{:.note}
• The reports repository location in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab > **Report 
 Settings** tab) overrides this selection.


• All repository paths in **Everest**  are stored in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths. On a network, the  UNC is a method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer,  without having to specify the storage device it is on. For Windows, the  UNC name format is \\servername\sharename\path\filename.


• You can specify the reports repository of the local workstation, or  another server/workstation on your network, as the global reports repository.


**Export File Path (High Speed)**
: Specify the global default location where you want  **Everest Reports** to be exported  and stored for retrieval at a later date. If a global or workstation setting  has not been made for this field, it defaults to **My 
 Documents**.

The location specified in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab > **Report 
 Settings** tab) overrides this selection.


**Export File Format**

{:.note}
The file format specified in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab > **Report 
 Settings** tab) overrides this selection.


**Prompt User for Export Options**
: Select this global default option to display the  **Export** dialog box, containing  additional options, when exporting reports in **Everest**.


{:.note}
If this option is selected, **Everest**  overrides the path specified in the **Export 
 File Path (High Speed)** field, and the format specified in the Export  File Format field, allowing you to choose alternate formats and destinations  from the **Export** dialog box.
