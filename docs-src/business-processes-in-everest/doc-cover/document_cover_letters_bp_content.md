# Document Cover Letters


When a sales document is faxed or sent to your customer or any other  person, it is normally sent with a cover letter.


Cover Letters for Sales Documents


The cover letter for a sales document normally contains the following  details:

- Customer name
- Customer's  Billing Address
- Customer's  Contact Address
- Date of letter
- Text of letter



To save time, you can create the text of the cover letter in advance  by creating a cover letter using the Cover Letter profile. Select the  cover letter at the time of printing or faxing from the Document Printing  Preferences dialog box.
