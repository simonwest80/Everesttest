{:.note}
The **Job Costings**browser is displayed only in the following cases:

- A job has been  defined for the selected customer (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Miscellaneous**  > **Job Explorer &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window &gt;** **Job****Costing** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In****New** **Window**  > **General** tab > **Customer**  field).
- The job code  does not have a **Closed** status  as defined in the **Status** field  of the **Job Costing** profile.
- The job code  has NOT expired. Whether a job code has expired or not is determined by  the login date and the date specified in the **End 
 Date** field of the **Job Costing** profile (path: **File** >  **Setup** > **Miscellaneous**  > **Job Explorer &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window** > **Job Costing** > **Options &gt; Edit &gt; In 
 New Window &gt; Status** tab).
