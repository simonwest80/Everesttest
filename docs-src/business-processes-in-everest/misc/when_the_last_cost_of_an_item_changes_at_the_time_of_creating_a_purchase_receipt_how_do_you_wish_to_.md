# When the last cost of an item changes at the time of receiving, how  do you wish to prompt the user for updating the last cost?


Select a method to decide how the last cost for an item has to be updated  whenever a purchase invoice is created.


| Always Prompt | A prompt message is displayed whenever a purchase invoice  is created. You can choose:<br/><br/>- To update the last  cost of each item in the purchase invoice.<br/>- Not to update the  last cost of each item in the purchase invoice. |
| Prompt if % difference is | Prompts you to update the last cost of an item only  when the percentage difference between the previous last cost and the  current last cost is equal to or greater than the percentage entered in  the **Enter Percent** field.<br/><br/><br/>If the percentage difference between the previous last  cost and the current last cost is less than the percentage specified,  **Everest** will automatically update  the last cost. |
| Update without prompting | Automatically updates the last cost. |
| Do not update | Does not update the last cost. |
