title: Global Repository
---


Specify the location of your global reports repository. **Everest Reports** reside in, and are accessed  from this location.


{:.note}
• The reports repository location in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **General** tab > **Report 
 Settings** tab) overrides this selection.


• All repository paths in **Everest**  are stored in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths. On a network, the  UNC is a method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer,  without having to specify the storage device it is on. For Windows, the  UNC name format is \\servername\sharename\path\filename.


• You can specify the reports repository of the local workstation, or  another server/workstation on your network, as the global reports repository.
