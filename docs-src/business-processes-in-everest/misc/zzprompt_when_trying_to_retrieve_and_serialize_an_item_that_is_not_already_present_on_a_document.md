title: Prompt when trying to retrieve and serialize an item that is not already present on a document
---


Use this option to first select the item, enter the quantity and then  attach the serial numbers committed to the document when creating a sales  or purchase return document. When retrieving serial numbers, you may retrieve  a serial number of an item that has not been added to the document. If  you do not select this check box, **Everest**  automatically adds the item code of the serial number to the document.
