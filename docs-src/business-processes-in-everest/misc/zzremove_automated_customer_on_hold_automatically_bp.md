title: Remove automated customer on hold automatically
---


Select this check box to remove automatic on credit holds  automatically. The conditions for automatic on credit holds are set in  the **Customer** profile â€“ **Payment 
 Information** tab. If the conditions are met, the system places an  automatic on credit hold for the customer. If you select this option and  the customer no longer meets the automatic on hold conditions, the system  automatically removes the automatic on credit hold. System checks for  automatic credit hold removal occur at the following times:

- Once per day at 12:00  AM
- Every time a payment/refund  or another financial change is made to the customer account



{:.example}
If the **Number 
 of days past due** is 15 days, the customer is put on hold automatically  after 15 days. If the customer makes the required payments according to  the payment terms after the automatic credit hold is placed and the **Remove automated customer on hold automatically**  option is selected, the system automatically removes the credit hold since  the account is current.


If  this option is not selected, the customer must be manually removed from  hold if the customer no longer meets the hold conditions.
