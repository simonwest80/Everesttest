title: Display in Matrix Format
---


Check this option to display the printed documents in matrix  format for matrix items. The line items that are part of a matrix group  will be printed in a matrix format. Printing in matrix format can greatly  reduce the amount of space/paper it takes to print out a document with  a large number of matrix items. Vendor part numbers and serial numbers  will not display if you select this option.


When you select this option, the **Display 
 in matrix format** check box is checked by default in the **Document 
 Printing Preferences** and **Document 
 E-mail Preferences** dialog boxes.
