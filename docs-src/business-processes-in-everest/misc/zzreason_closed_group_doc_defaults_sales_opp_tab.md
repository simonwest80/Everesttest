title: Reason Closed Group
---


Specify the default (reason closed) group to which the reason closed  selection must belong. Sales opportunities are automatically closed when:

- The sales quote  for the sales opportunity is converted to a sales order
- A sales order  or invoice is directly created



When a sales opportunity is automatically closed, the reason closed  group specified in this field is automatically displayed in the **Reason Closed Group** field of the associated  **Sales Opportunity** profile (path:  **Sales Order** profile > **Options** > **Edit 
 Opportunity &gt; Details** tab).
