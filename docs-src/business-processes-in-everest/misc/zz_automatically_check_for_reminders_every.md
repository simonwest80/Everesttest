title: Automatically check for reminders every
---


Select this check box if you want **Everest**  to automatically check for reminders and specify the frequency for checking  reminders. If this check box is not selected, reminders are NOT displayed.


The value in the **Automatically check 
 for reminders every** field on the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; General &gt; 
 Others** tab) defaults to the value specified here. Since this setting  is applicable at the company wide level, deselecting  this box will allow **Everest** to  load faster. If you deselect  this checkbox, the reminder preference in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box cannot be selected. You can specify a maximum  value of 999 in this field.
