{:.example}
A garment company sells more than 10,000 varieties  of garments which are inventoried as matrix groups/items. The company  also sells 50 different items as accessories. For setting a special discount  only for the accessories, apply special pricing to all the items in the  **Special Pricing** browser (path:  **Inventory** > **Discounts**  > **Special Pricing**), and select  this checkbox to ignore the special pricing for the matrix groups.
