title: Automatically apply payment terms discounts for vendor document
---


Select this check box if you want **Everest**  to automatically compute the discount amount based on the Payment Term  while making payments to vendors on a purchase invoice. The discount percentage  has to be specified in the **Discount (%)**  field in the **Payment Terms** profile  (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Payment Terms &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**). The amount that  is available for discount is automatically displayed in the **Discount 
 available** field in the **Payment**  dialog box. The discount amount that can be applied defaults to the discount  which is available and is displayed in the **Discount 
 Applied** field in the **Payment**  dialog box if the above option is selected. You can edit this field if  required.
