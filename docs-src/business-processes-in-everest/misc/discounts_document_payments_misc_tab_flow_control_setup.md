A payment term of Net 60 (payment on the 60th  day from the date on the invoice) with a discount of 2% (applicable if  payment is made within 60 days) is attached to a vendor. If you make a  payment to the vendor within 60 days of the purchase invoice's due date,  **Everest** automatically computes  a discount of 2% on the purchase invoice balance.
