# Prompt method for adding shipping charges calculated by an external  program


You may use an external utility to compute shipping charges on your  sales documents. You have to map the external utility to the required  table and field in **Everest** in  order that the sales orders or invoices are updated with the computed  freight charges. Use this field to define whether or not the freight charges  computed in such a manner have to be automatically updated on the documents.
