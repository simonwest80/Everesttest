title: Retrieve all open purchase invoices, open debit memos and purchase orders with deposits when a vendor is selected in a payment journal
---


Use this option to indicate whether all open purchase invoices and debit  memos, and purchase orders with ‘available’ deposits must be displayed  when you select a vendor in a purchase journal. Clear this option if you  have a large database, and data retrieval takes time.
