# Prompt for customer credit status when sales order is converted into  sales invoice


Select this check box to be prompted when a sales order, which is being  converted to a sales invoice from the **Pull 
 Sheet** browser, has exceeded the customerâ€™s credit limit. By default,  this option is selected.


The **Pull Sheet** browser displays  a list of the pick tickets that are generated. Use this browser to specify  the quantity actually picked for shipping by entering the quantity in  the **Quantity Picked** column or  using a bar code scanner.


After you have confirmed the picked quantity, it is committed on the  sales order retrieved into the browser. Thereafter, you can convert the  sales order to a sales invoice by selecting the option **Convert 
 to Invoice** from the **Pull Sheet**  browser.


If you have defined a credit limit for the customer for whom the sales  order is created, **Everest** prompts  you that the credit limit has been exceeded. If you do not possess the  required security rights, you are not allowed to convert the sales order  into a sales invoice.
