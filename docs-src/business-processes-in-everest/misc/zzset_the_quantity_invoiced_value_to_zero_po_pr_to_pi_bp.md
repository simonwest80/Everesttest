title: Set the quantity invoiced value to zero when converting a PO/PR to a PI
---


When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, the Invoiced  column automatically displays the quantity ordered but not invoiced. When  you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, the Invoiced column  automatically displays the quantity received but not invoiced. If the  quantity you intend to invoice is less than the quantity ordered/received  but not invoiced and the invoice is saved, the amount payable to the vendor  is not correct. Check this option to set the quantity invoiced to zero  so you must manually enter the quantity invoiced.
