# Prompt for duplicate PO number from the same customer


Select this check box to avoid duplication by checking for the customer's  PO number. When you create an invoicing document, you can enter the customer’s  PO number for your reference. If you have entered the same number for  the same customer in the purchase documents and you also check the **Prompt for duplicate PO number from the same 
 customer** option, **Everest** prompts  you that a duplicate PO number already exists. You can therefore check  if the same invoicing document has been duplicated and avoid overstating  your revenues.


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  receive the customer’s PO No. A1124 and create a sales invoice. Subsequently,  the customer sends you a batch of PO’s that includes the PO No.A1124.  When you create a new invoice for the PO No.A1124 and enter this number  as the reference, **Everest** will  prompt you that an invoice with the same invoice number has already been  created. You can thus avoid duplicate sales invoice for the same sales  transaction.
