title: Allow users to access only those stock areas in the logged in location
---


Select this check box to ensure that users assign stock to documents  only from stock areas/bins that belong to the login location. Assigning  means committing or shipping items from these locations on sales and debit  documents.


If a location is short of stock, available stock should be transferred  from other locations. This helps in the following ways:

- You can keep  track of the inventory that is moved to/borrowed from other locations.
- You can also  ensure that locations do not use stocks belonging to other locations.
