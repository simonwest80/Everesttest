Specify the default reason closed selection that must be associated  with sales opportunities that are automatically closed. Only reasons that  belong to the group selected in the **Reason 
 Closed Group** field are available for selection.


When a sales opportunity is automatically closed, the reason closed  selection specified in this field is automatically displayed in the **Reason Closed** field (path: **Sales 
 Order** profile > **Options** >  **Edit Opportunity &gt; Details** tab).


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you specify the default reason closed as "Best Price", the same  is displayed in the  **Reason****Closed** field of the **Sales 
 Opportunity** profile (path: **Sales 
 Order** profile > **Options** >  **Edit Opportunity &gt; Details** tab).
