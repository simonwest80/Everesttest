# Display list of add-ons  when adding items to sales documents


When you sell an item, it makes good business sense to also be informed  about the accessories that can be sold along with it. This option allows  you to define whether the accessories for an item must be automatically  displayed when it is retrieved into a document. This setting is applicable  only to sales orders and invoices. If you select this option, when an  item is retrieved into a document, the add-ons,  if any, defined for the item will be displayed in a separate browser.


Select whether or not add-ons should be automatically displayed when  an item (for which an add-on has been defined) is retrieved into a sales  document. This setting is applicable only to sales orders and invoices.
