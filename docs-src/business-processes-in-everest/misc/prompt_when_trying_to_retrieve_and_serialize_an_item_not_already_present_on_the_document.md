# Prompt when trying to retrieve and serialize an item not already present  on the document


Use this option to first select the item, enter the quantity and then  attach the serial numbers committed to the document when creating a sales  or purchase return document. When retrieving serial numbers, you may retrieve  a serial number of an item that has not been added to the document. If  you do not select this check box, **Everest**  automatically adds the item code of the serial number to the document.
