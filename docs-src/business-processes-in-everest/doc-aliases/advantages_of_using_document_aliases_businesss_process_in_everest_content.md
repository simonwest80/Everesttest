# Advantages of Using Document Aliases


The operational advantages of using document aliases are:

- Better analysis  of sales and purchases - By setting up document aliases, you can obtain  reports for selected document aliases and analyze the total value of the  sales/purchase orders or quotes for a product line.



{:.example}
The browser of the document alias service  orders will display a list of documents of that type.

- Restrict access  to documents - You can restrict access to the document aliases by a user.



{:.example}
Only sales representatives of your service  business are allowed to create document aliases of ‘service orders’.

- Print different  documents for different business lines - Having different titles, the  Sales Invoice for products differs from the Sales Invoice for services.  This helps you and your customers distinguish between the types of sales.
- Customer interaction  and follow-up - The sales representatives can easily identify the status  of documents pertaining to their line, from the document alias. This helps  to follow up on customers.
- Identify the sales  and return documents for each of your **Everest**  eStorefront stores - You can assign a different document alias to the Sales  Orders for each web store thus, helping you process them faster.
