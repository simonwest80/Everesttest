# Discontinue/Reactivate a Document Alias


**Everest** allows you to temporarily  discontinue records of document aliases. When a record is discontinued,  it is not deleted from the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued  record can be made available for selection by activating it again.


{:.note}
A document alias specified as the default  in the **Default Document Alias Preferences**  cannot be deactivated.
