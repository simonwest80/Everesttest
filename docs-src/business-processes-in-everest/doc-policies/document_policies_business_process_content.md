# Document Policies


Document Policies are custom messages/notes/information/conditions that  are printed (usually at the bottom of the document) along with the system  documents and their aliases.


{:.example}
‘All prices are valid for a week from the date of the document’, may  be your company's policy for Sales Orders.


Your POS Invoice may have a message, ‘Thank you for doing business with  us’.


You can also set up a document policy for a document alias or for individual  customer or vendor documents. (Policies can be modified for individual  documents).

- When a document  is created for a specific customer, the policy defined for that document  for the particular customer will be displayed.
- If a policy has  not been set for the customer, the policy defined for the document alias  will be displayed.
- If no policy exists  for the alias, the default policy specified in the **Document 
 Default Preferences** is displayed.



{:.note}
It is not mandatory to attach a document policy  to all your documents.
