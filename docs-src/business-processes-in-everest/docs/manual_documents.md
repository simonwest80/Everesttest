# Manual Documents


**Everest** records journal entries  created by the user, directly (without the use of System documents) as  Manual documents. They consist of orders or final documents only, which  are included in the **Vendor** and  **Customer** aging browsers.


The document numbers are automatically generated when you create Manual  Purchase and Sales Journals. **Everest**  prefixes these numbers with an ‘M’, to denote that it is a manual document.


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  You  can directly record the transaction of miscellaneous items that are either  of low value, or are not regularly dealt in, in a Purchase or Sales Journal,  as the case may be.
