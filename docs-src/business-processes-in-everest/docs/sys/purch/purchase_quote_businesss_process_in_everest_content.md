# Purchase Quote


The **Purchase Quote** is the first  document generated in the purchase process. The purchase quote:

- Records quotation  details received from vendors.
- Helps the Purchase  department evaluate quotes from various vendors and place an order against  the best quote.



The information in the purchase quote flows into the purchase order  and from the purchase order into the purchase receipt and purchase invoice.
