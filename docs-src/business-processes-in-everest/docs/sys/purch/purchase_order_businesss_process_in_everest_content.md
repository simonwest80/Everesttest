# Purchase Order


The **Purchase Order** is the second  document generated in the purchase process. The purchase order:

- Is created  when you decide to purchase products or services from a vendor.
- Records details  of the order placed.
- Helps in materials  planning (the quantities already on order and their expected delivery  dates are considered before placing further orders).
- Records the  receipt of items whose quality has to be assessed before they are accounted  into stock.



Information from the purchase order flows into the purchase receipt  and invoice.


**Everest** also enables you to  do the following:

- Handle drop  shipments (a purchase order can be created from a sales order).
- Generate purchase  orders in bulk for items, based on inventory levels and for existing sales  orders.
