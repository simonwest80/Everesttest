# Purchase Documents


The purchase documents record details of purchases from vendors.


The steps in the Purchase process in **Everest**  are listed below:

- Create a purchase  quote.
- Place a purchase  order.
- Create a purchase  receipt when you receive the items.
- Create a purchase  invoice to make vendor payments.
