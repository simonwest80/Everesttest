# Point of Sale (POS) Documents


The **Point of Sale (POS)** system  is synonymous with across the counter sales, where the items are handed  over to the customer on immediate payment. You need not create an account  for every POS customer. It is relevant only if the items are to be shipped  later, or are sold on credit. **Everest**  handles POS using two documents - the **POS 
 Invoice** and the **POS Credit Memo**.
