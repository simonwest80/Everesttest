# Debit Quote


The **Debit Quote** is the first  document generated in the purchase return process. The quantity of the  items to be returned, or the value of services to be debited is recorded  in a debit quote.


The information in the debit quote flows into the debit order.


{:.note}
The debit quote is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when a debit quote is created.
