# Debit Order


The **Debit Order** is the second  document generated in the purchase return process. The debit order:

- Is created when  you have identified the items to be returned to a vendor.
- Defines the exact  items to be returned, or the stock area from which they are to be returned.
- Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered when assessing free stock).
- Is also used to  record the dispatch of items to a vendor for repairs or replacement.



The information in the debit order flows into the debit memo.


{:.note}
The debit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are **not**  generated when a debit order is created.
