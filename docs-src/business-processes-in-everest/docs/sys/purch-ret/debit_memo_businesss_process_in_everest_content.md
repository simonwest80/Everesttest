# Debit Memo


The **Debit Memo** is the third  and final step in the purchase return process. It is created when inventoried  items are returned to the vendor, or an allowance is given by the vendor  for unsatisfactory services.


You can either create a new debit memo or convert an existing debit  order to a debit memo.


{:.note}
The debit memo is the final document, which  updates the inventory values, vendor balances, stocks and accounts payable.  Accounting entries are automatically generated when a debit memo is created.
