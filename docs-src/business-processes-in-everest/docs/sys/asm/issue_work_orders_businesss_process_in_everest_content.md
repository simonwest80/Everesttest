# Issue Work Orders


When a Work Order is issued, the materials required for the work order  are reduced from their inventories and added to the inventory of the work-in-progress.


![]({{site.bp_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â Accounting  entries are generated when the value of the inventory is transferred from  production to work-in-progress, and from work-in-progress to the Built  stage.
