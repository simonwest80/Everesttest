# System Documents


You can create system documents by using the quotes, orders, invoices,  receipts and memo documents from the Purchasing, Invoicing and Inventory  menus. **Everest** automatically generates:

- The accounting  entries (for the final system documents).
- The sequence numbers  for the system documents.

System documents are further classified into the following categories:

- **Intermediate/Pending 
 documents** - Intermediate/Pending documents are created at the initial  stage of a business transaction. Accounting entries are not generated  at this stage.

- **Final 
 documents** - Final documents are created from the pending documents  to complete the purchase, sale or return process. Accounting entries are  automatically generated when these documents are created.
