# Sales Invoice


The **Sales Invoice** is the last  document in the sales process. A sales invoice:

- Is created  when inventoried items are shipped to a customer, or customers are billed  for services rendered.
- Records details  of the items and services purchased by the customer.



The information in the sales order flows into the sales invoice.
