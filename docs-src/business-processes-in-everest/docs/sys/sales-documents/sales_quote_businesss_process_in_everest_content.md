# Sales Quote


The **Sales Quote** is the first  document generated in the sales process. The sales quote:

- Records details  of quotations sent to customers.
- Helps the sales  department to follow up with prospective customers on the various quotes  issued.
- Tracks prospective  customers and the value of sales expected, using the Sales Opportunity  feature.



The information in the sales quote flows into the sales order
