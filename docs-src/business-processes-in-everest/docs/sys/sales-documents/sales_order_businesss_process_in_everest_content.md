# Sales Order


The **Sales Order** is the second  document generated in the sales process. The sales order:

- Is created  when a customer places an order for products or services.
- Records details  of the order placed.
- Helps in materials  planning (the quantities on order and their expected delivery dates are  considered for the calculation of available stock and for placing the  purchase orders).
- Records the  quantities of items reserved against the order. (You can identify the  exact items to be shipped, or the stock area from which it is to be shipped).
