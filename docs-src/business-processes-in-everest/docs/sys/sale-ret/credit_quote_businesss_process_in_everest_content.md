# Credit Quote


The **Credit Quote** is the first  document in the sales return process. When a customer requests a Return  Merchandise Authorization for defective or unsatisfactory items, the credit  quote records the tentative quantity of these items, or the value of services  for which the customer wants compensation.


The information in the credit quote flows into the credit order.


{:.note}
The credit quote is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when a credit quote is  created.
