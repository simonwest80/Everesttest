# Sales Return Documents


The **Sales Return** documents record  the return of inventoried items by the customer, or are used to reduce  the charges for unsatisfactory services rendered to the customer.


The steps in the **Sales Return**  process in **Everest** are:

- Create a credit  quote.
- Create a credit  order.
- Create a credit  memo.
- Refund customers.
