**Life (in months)**

The IRS standards are summarized in their Publication 534.


**Original Value**

**Salvage Value**
: Enter the amount you would receive if you sold the  fully depreciated fixed asset at the end of its useful life.


**Depreciation (per month)**

: Depreciation = (Original Value - Salvage Value)/Life
