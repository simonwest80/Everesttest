# Discontinue a Fixed Assets Profile


A fixed asset may be discontinued if it has been fully depreciated,  sold or otherwise disposed off. Discontinued fixed assets will not be  considered for calculation of depreciation even if the asset has not been  fully depreciated.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a fixed asset, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Fixed Assets**. You will see the **Fixed 
 Assets** browser.
- From the **Fixed Assets** browser, highlight the  required record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  asked to confirm the deactivation.
- Click **OK**. The record that was selected is  no longer visible in the **Fixed Assets**  browser.
