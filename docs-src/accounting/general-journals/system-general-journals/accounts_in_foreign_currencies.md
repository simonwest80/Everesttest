# Accounts in Foreign Currencies


The following system general journals are always created in base currency:

- Inventory adjustments
- Stock transfers
- Import of item  balances
- Depreciation
- Opening balances
- Year end closing



Adjusting entries for bank accounts in a different currency are translated  into the base currency and displayed.


A general journal transaction may be created for accounts in a currency  different from the base currency. The amounts of debit or credit may be  entered either in the foreign currency or the base currency.


The transaction view is initially in base currency. Switch to the foreign  currency view by selecting the option **View 
 in Foreign Currency**.


**Exchange Rate**


The exchange rate against your base currency is displayed in this field.
