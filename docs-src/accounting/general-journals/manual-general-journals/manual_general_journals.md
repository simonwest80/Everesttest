# Manual General Journals


Manual general journals are created to record transactions that do not  affect any particular customer or vendor account.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â Contra  entries for cash and bank accounts, and adjusting entries.


In a manual general journal, you CANNOT select the following control  accounts:

- Accounts Receivable
- Accounts Payable
- Vendor Deposit
- Customer Deposit



You can however select the 'Inventory control' account and the 'Work  in Progress' account to make adjustments to the stock value. This is however  not recommended since it may cause discrepancies in your inventory reports  and financial statements.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)Before  making manual adjustments to your stock (during stock reconciliation)  ensure the following:

- Post all purchase/sale  journals
- Print the latest  inventory reports



When you select either of these accounts, **Everest** asks you to confirm that you want to proceed.
