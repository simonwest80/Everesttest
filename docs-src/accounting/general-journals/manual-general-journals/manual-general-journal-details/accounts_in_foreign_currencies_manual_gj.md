# Foreign Currency Accounts


A general journal transaction may be created for accounts in a currency  different from the base currency. The amounts of debit or credit may be  entered either in the foreign currency or the base currency.


**Entering amounts in base currency**
: The transaction view is initially in base currency.  Enter the amount of debit or credit in base currency; the amounts will  be translated to the foreign currency using the current exchange rate  defined in the **Exchange Rate** profile  or the rate specified in the **Exchange 
 Rate** column of the **Transaction 
 Entries** section in the **General 
 Journal** profile.


**Entering amounts in foreign currency**
: The transaction view is initially in base currency.  Switch to the foreign currency view by selecting the option **View 
 in Foreign Currency**. Enter the amount of debit or credit in foreign  currency; the amounts will be translated to the base currency using the  current exchange rate defined in the **Exchange 
 Rate** profile or the rate specified in the **Exchange 
 Rate** column of the **Transaction 
 Entries** section in the **General 
 Journal** profile.


**Exchange Rate**
: When you select a foreign currency account, the  current exchange rate for that currency is displayed. The exchange rate  displayed is the exchange rate against your base currency.
: If the exchange rate for the transaction is different  from the current rate, then you can change the rate.
