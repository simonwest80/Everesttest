# Reverse a General Journal


You can reverse a posted/unposted General Journal. You may  wish to reverse a journal to change, nullify, reverse, or change the date  of a General Journal or for any other reason. You can also reverse transactions.


{:.example}
A staff accountant has created a General Journal  on 12/21/2007 debiting Inventory for $5000 and credited the amount to  Inventory - Work in Progress for $5000 on receiving some items. She posts  the General Journal. She later finds that the items have been incorrectly  moved and so reverses the entry. This nullifies the General Journal entry  made on 12/21/2007 and shows a new General Journal entry on 12/22/2007.
