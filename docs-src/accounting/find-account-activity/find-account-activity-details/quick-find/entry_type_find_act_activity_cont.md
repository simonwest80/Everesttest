# Entry Type


The entry type field allows you to search for debit or credit transactions or both. This is particularly useful when you search by journal and would like to see only the account activity for the account debited or credited.


The options are:

- **Both** - when you select both, the find account activity search is carried out in both debit and credit columns of transactions.
- **Debit** - when you select debit, only debit columns of transactions are searched for the account activity.
- **Credit** - when you select credit, only credit columns of transactions are searched for the account activity.
