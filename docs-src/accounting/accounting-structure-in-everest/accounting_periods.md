# Accounting Periods


The business world breaks fiscal years into periods to fit in with their  modes of operation. Each period is called an accounting period. Most companies  follow the standard calendar year with 12 periods (months), although some  use four quarterly periods.


While outside entities are interested in the company's results for a  fiscal year or a quarter, the management requires accounting information  for shorter time spans such as a month or fortnight.


Accounting periods in **Everest**  determine the divisions into which an accounting year is broken. Transactions  are assigned to relevant accounting periods based on the transaction date.  The status of accounting periods also determines whether transactions  can be created for that period.
