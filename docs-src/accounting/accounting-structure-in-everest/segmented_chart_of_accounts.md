# Segmented Chart of Accounts


The Segmented Chart of Accounts in **Everest**  enables you to design the structure of your chart of accounts based on  your industry requirements. Your chart of accounts can be configured by  the creation of up to 22 segments and a maximum of 45 characters. Individual  segments represent your company's reporting structure as you define it.  For example, segments can be defined for division, department, region,  account, and sub-account. You can perform financial analysis for any of  the segments that you define in your account structure. By segmenting  your chart of accounts, you gain the ability to report on selective segments  of your account. Consult your Accountant before creating your chart of  accounts segment format.


The first step in creating a segmented chart of accounts is to create  your segments. Once you define your segments, you can create accounts  using those segments.


If you choose not to set up segments, your **Account 
 Code** defaults to one segment called "**Account**"  with a length of seven characters.
