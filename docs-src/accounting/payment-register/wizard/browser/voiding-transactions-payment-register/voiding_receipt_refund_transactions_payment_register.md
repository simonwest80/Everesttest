# Void Receipt/Refund Transactions - Payment Register


Voiding transactions from the payment register is different from purging  transactions. When a transaction is voided from the payment register,  the transaction balance is set to $0.00 and the customer or vendor associated  with the transaction is removed. When a transaction is purged, the transaction  is deleted from Everest permanently and all references to the purged transaction  are removed.


{:.example}
If a payment transaction is purged from the  **Unposted Payment Journal**, this  transaction is no longer referenced in the **Unposted 
 Payment Journal**, **Journal Transaction**  browser, **Payment Register**, **Document Payment History**, or **Event 
 History**.


You can void a transaction from the **Payment 
 Register** or from the documents through the **Payment 
 History** screen. You can also recreate the voided transaction, if  necessary. The following procedures can be completed using the **Void**  option:

- **Void 
 a Transaction** - In this case, the transaction balance is set to  $0.00, the customer/vendor associated with the transaction is removed.
- **Void 
 and Recreate a Transaction** - In this case, the transaction balance  is set to $0.00, the customer or vendor associated with the transaction  is removed, and a new transaction is recreated to replace the voided entry.



{:.steps}
To void/void and recreate transactions from  the Payment Register, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting** >  **Payment Register**. You will see  the **Payment Register Wizard**.
- Specify the  details and click **Finish** to view  the **Payments Register** browser.
- Highlight the  required transaction and select **Options**  > **Void**. You will see the **Void**  dialog box.



The **Void** option is available  for all UNPOSTED transactions irrespective of whether checks have been  printed or not.


The **Void** option is not available  for the following transactions:

- Reversed
- Reversal
- Already Voided
- Cleared/Reconciled



Click **OK** to void the check and  return to the **Payment Register**  browser.
