# Sales


Sales and sales return transactions may be accounted either through system sales journals (that are generated when sales invoices and credit memos are created) or by making a manual entry in the Sales Journal.


System sales journals are created:

- To account for sales invoices or credit memos created.
- When customer balances are imported.



Manual sales journals are created to manually account for sales returns or credit memos.
