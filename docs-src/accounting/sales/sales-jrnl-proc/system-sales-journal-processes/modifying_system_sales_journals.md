# Modify System Sales Journals


System sales journals cannot be modified. They can only be viewed.


You can modify system journals only by changing the sales invoice or credit memo that created the particular transaction. Changes can be made to a document only till the journal (pertaining to the document) is posted.


When you modify a sales invoice or credit memo, the existing accounting entry is replaced with the accounting entry required for the modified Sales Invoice/Credit Memo. Customer balances are updated accordingly.
