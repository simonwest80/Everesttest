# Delete Transactions - Manual Sales Journals


Transactions can be deleted from the **Sales 
 Journal** profile only if the sales journal has NOT been posted.  If a payment has been received or a refund made against a manual sales  invoice or manual credit memo, you cannot delete the transaction.


A journal is deemed to be voided if all the transactions in the sales  journal are deleted. On voiding a journal, it's status changes to **Voided Journal**.


You can delete a sales transaction from any of the following locations:

- The [**Sales Journal** profile]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/sales/sales-jrnl-proc/manual-sales-jrnl-proc/voiding-deleting/del-trans/delete_transactions_from_the_sales_journal_profile.html)
- The [**Sales Journal Transactions** browser]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/sales/sales-jrnl-proc/manual-sales-jrnl-proc/voiding-deleting/del-trans/delete_transactions_from_the_sales_journal_browser.html) ****
