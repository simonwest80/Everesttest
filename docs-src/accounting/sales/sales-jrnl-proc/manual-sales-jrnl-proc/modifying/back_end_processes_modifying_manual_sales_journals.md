# Back End Processes - Modify Manual Sales Journals


The back end processes when a manual sales journal is modified are:

- The customer's balances are updated if there is a change in the amount.
- If the amount has been changed the document balances are updated.
- If an entry associated to a manual document is deleted, the manual document is deleted.
