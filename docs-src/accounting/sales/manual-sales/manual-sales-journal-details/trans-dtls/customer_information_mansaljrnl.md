# Customer Information


**Customer**
: This field is used to specify the customer to whom the items are being sold. The customer's billing address is displayed below this field. The address cannot be edited. The customer code cannot be modified once the journal is saved.


**On Credit Hold and Credit Limit**
: These fields display whether the customer is on credit hold, and the customer's credit limit. The 'credit limit' and 'on hold status' is the current credit limit and hold status and not the limit at the time of creating the document.
: These details are automatically displayed from the **Customer** profile (path: **Invoicing** > **Customers** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window** > **Payment Information** tab). The credit limit is displayed in the customer's currency.
