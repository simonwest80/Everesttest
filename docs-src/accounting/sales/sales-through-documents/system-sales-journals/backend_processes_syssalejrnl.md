# Back End Processes - System Sales Journal


The following processes occur in the back end when a sales invoice /credit  memo is created:

- When a sales  invoice is created, the customer's unposted amount as displayed in the  **Customer** profile (path: **Invoicing** > **Customers**  > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window**) increases  by the amount credited, and the net balance increases.
- When a credit  memo is created, the customer's unposted amount as displayed in the **Customer** profile decreases by the amount  debited, and the net balance decreases.
