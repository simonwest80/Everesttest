# The Multiple Receipts Browser


The multiple receipts browser provides a detailed break up of the customers  and the documents selected for payment.


Documents whose creation date is after the login date are not included  in this browser.


This browser is displayed when the **Finish** button is pressed in the **Multiple 
 Receipts Wizard**.


**To select a document for payment:**

- Select the  check box beside the document number. The [**Manual Check** profile]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/the_manual_check_profile_mult_rpts.html) is displayed.  Enter the check number in the **Check #** field and select the date of payment. Click **OK** to save the details.
- All documents  can be selected for payment by selecting **Options 
 &gt; Select All**.
- The **Un 
 Select All** option in the **Options** menu deselects  all the documents.



**A receipt transaction is created based on the  following:**

- A transaction  is created for each selected customer.
- The sales invoices  are set off against the credit memos in arriving at the amount receivable.
- In the case  of manual checks, a transaction is created for all documents (sales invoices  and credit memos) having the same check number.



If the total amount on credit memos is greater than the total amounts  outstanding on sales invoices, the excess is presumed to be refunded to  the customer.


The information available in the **Multiple 
 Receipts** browser is categorized under the following heads:

- [Upper  Section]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/upper_section_multiple_receipts_browser.html)
