# Document Criteria - Payment Terms


This section enables you to filter the documents based on their payment  terms.


**Include**

By default, all the  payment terms that have been defined are displayed in this column, but  you have the option of excluding payment terms, if required. To exclude  a payment term, highlight it and click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_exclude.gif) button. Click  on the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_exclude_all.gif) button to move all the payment terms to the exclude  column.


**Exclude**
: Documents that contain the payment terms specified  in this column are not included for payment. To include payment terms,  highlight the required payment terms and click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_include.gif) button.  To include all the payment terms contained in the **Exclude**  column for payment, click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_include_all.gif) button.


After specifying the payment terms to be included, click **Next**.  You will see the [**Document Criteria - Document Aliases**]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/multiple-receipts/wizard/document_criteria_document_aliases_multiplereceiptswizard.html)  section. ****
