# Batch Payment Processing


Payments received or refunds made can be processed online or in a batch  subsequently. The **Batch** **Payment Processing** feature (path: **Accounting** > **Accounts 
 Receivable** > **Batch** **Payment Processing**) allows you to process  pending credit card/cash/check transactions in a batch, instead of processing  the payments for each document individually. Address and CVV2 verification  is also carried out, as required, when you process credit card transactions  using this option.


Transactions recorded in the **Batch 
 Credit Card Processing** browser may be:

- [Transactions  created in Everest]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/transactions_created_in_everest.html)
- [Transactions  created in Everest eStorefront]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/transactions_created_in_everest_e_commerce.html)



There are four types of **Batch Credit 
 Card Processing** browsers:

- [New  sale or refund]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_new_sale_or_refund_browser.html)
- [New  authorization]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_new_authorization_browser.html)
- [Use  prior authorization]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_use_prior_authorization_browser.html)
- [Other]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/customer-receipts-and-refunds/batch-payment-processing/batch_credit_card_process_others_browser.html)
