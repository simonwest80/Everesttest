To batch process payments/receipts, select the **Batch 
 Processing** check box in the **Payment/Refund/Collection**  dialog box.


The following transactions are also displayed in this browser:

- Payments/receipts  that are batch processed, and the associated payment method has no processor  attached.
- Transactions  recorded on your eStorefront  shop, if the real time processing options are not selected.
- Web orders  whose payment method is associated with a WorldPay  processor.
- Sales Orders  that are imported with the payment preference set to "Paid".

**Process Transactions**


When you process these transactions (path: **Batch****Payment Process** browser > **Options** > **Process**),  journal entries will be generated in the relevant journals. Processed  transactions will not be visible in the **Batch 
 Payment Process – Others** browser.
