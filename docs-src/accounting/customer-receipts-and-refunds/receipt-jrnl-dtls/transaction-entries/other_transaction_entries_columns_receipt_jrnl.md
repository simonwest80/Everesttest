# Other Columns in Transaction Entries 


**Short/Over**
: This field indicates the amount by which the transaction  is out of balance and is automatically computed. If the amount displayed  is positive, the total of debits exceeds the total credits; if the amount  is negative, then total credits exceed the total debits.


**Check Box Column**
: This column allows you to select the documents that  are paid or refunded. Once you select a document, you can modify the amount  being received/ refunded.


**Document #**
: This column displays the document against which  the receipt/refund is being made. All documents that have an outstanding  balance are displayed. You can select multiple documents.


**Loc/Sub-Loc**
: The location or sub-location to which the amount  must be allocated is displayed in this column. The location/sub-location  identifies the cost centers or profit centers for an expense or revenue  account. Locations/Sub-Locations cannot be assigned to asset and liability  accounts.


**Notes**
: Notes provide a brief description about the transaction.  You may enter a note for each entry. Notes are not automatically generated  for system entries.


**Job Code**
: The job code identifies the job to which the receipt/refund  has to be allocated.
