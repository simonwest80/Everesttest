# Need for Purging Receipts


Receipt transactions may be voided for any of the following reasons:

- The check received  from the customer was returned due to insufficient funds.
- The receipt  was wrongly recorded. Wrong recording includes accounting for the receipt  from a wrong customer or for a wrong amount. The bank account or payment  method may also be incorrectly selected.
