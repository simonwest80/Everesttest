# Purge Receipt Journals


Receipt journals can be purged only if they have not been posted. When  a journal is purged:

- All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.
- The journal  appears in the browser with the description 'Purged Journal'.



Journals containing the following transactions can be purged:

- Posted transactions.
- Refund transactions  for which computerized checks have been printed.
- Unposted check  payments where the checks are issued manually.
- Unposted cash,  credit card or other type of payments.
- Unposted refunds  to customers.



Journals that contain transactions purged from the payment register  or reversal entries for a transaction purged from the payment register  cannot be purged.
