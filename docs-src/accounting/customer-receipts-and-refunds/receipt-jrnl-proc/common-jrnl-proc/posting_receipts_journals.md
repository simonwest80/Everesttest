Everest does not allow you to post a journal which is not balanced (the  total credits do not equal the total debits). If there are short/over  amounts the journal will not post. In this case, simply balance the journal  In addition, several other conditions will prevent the journal from posting.  See the **Remarks** descriptions in  the **Journal Posting Results** information.

We recommend that you print and review each journal before posting it,  although by default Everest will let  you  post a journal without printing it first. You can deselect the preference  **Allow user to post a journal even if 
 it is not printed** to prevent Everest from posting an unprinted  journal. Make this change in the Other Flow Control preferences (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow 
 Control** > **Other Flow Control 
 &gt; General** tab).


When Everest posts a journal, the respective chart of accounts updates  with the transactions contained in the journal. In the case of foreign  currency documents, the account balances update in both base and foreign  currency.
