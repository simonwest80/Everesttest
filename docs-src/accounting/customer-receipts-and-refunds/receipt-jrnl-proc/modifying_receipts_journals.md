# Modify Receipt Journals


Receipt details cannot be modified from the document on which the receipt/refund  was made. These details can however be modified from the **Receipt 
 Journal** profile. You can make such modifications only till the  journal is posted.


The following modifications are possible:

- New transactions  can be added.
- Existing transactions  can be deleted.
- Certain fields  can be modified.



If a manual sales order is created for entry type 'Miscellaneous Deposit',  then the document number cannot be changed; but the entry can be deleted.  When the amount in an entry is modified, **Everest**  also updates the amounts received against the documents.


If details other than those listed below need to be rectified, you would  have to void the receipt journal and recreate the entries.
