# The Posted Receipt Journal Transactions Browser


This browser is displayed when the **General****Ledger** (**Detail**)  option (path: **Posted Receipt Journals** browser > **Options** >  **Transactions** > **General****Ledger** (**Detail**))  is selected. The **Posted Receipt Journal 
 Transactions** browser lists all the transactions in the selected  journal with details such as the document number, reference data, payment  terms and amounts debited or credited.


If payment is received through a credit card, the card number is displayed  in the **Reference** column. Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).


Options common to all browsers are available in this browser.
