# Journal Information


The journal section displays the journal number in which the adjustment  entry is recorded. The fiscal year, period and date on which the entry  is created is also displayed in this section.


**Journal #**
: This is the unique number used to identify this  journal, and is automatically generated when the details for the adjustment  transaction are saved.
: This transaction is saved as a general journal.  When a new general journal is created, the number assigned is the next  number in sequence specified for general journals in the login location  or the parent location of the login sub-location.
