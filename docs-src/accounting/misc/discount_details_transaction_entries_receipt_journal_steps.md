# Discount Details


**Discount Date**
: The date before which the payment must be received  (from the customer) in order to be eligible for a discount is displayed.  This date is computed only if the document's payment term allows discounts.  This date is determined based on the **Discount 
 Type** specified on the [**Payment Terms** profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/payment-information/payment-terms/set-up-a-payment-term/payment_terms_profile_general_tab.html) (of the document's  payment term).


**Discount Available**
: Discounts may be available for prompt payment based  on the payment terms for the sales invoice. Based on the payment terms,  the total amount of discount available is displayed in this column. Discounts  are automatically calculated only on sales invoices.
: In the case of manual documents the discount is  computed from the document date. This amount is displayed for information  purposes only.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)  To  account for the payment discount allowed to the customer, insert another  transaction entry with transaction type as “Payment Discount”.

The **Discount 
 Date** and **Discount Available** fields  have data only if the document is a final document.
