You can apply documents to set off the amount:

- **Due 
 from the customer against any dues by you to the customer** - Dues  from a customer is the balance to be paid on a sales invoice and the amount  to be paid as a deposit on a sales order. Dues to a customer are the amount  to be paid as deposit on a credit order and the amount to be refunded  on a credit memo.
- **Due 
 by you to a vendor against any dues from the vendor** - Dues to a  vendor is the balance to be paid on a purchase invoice and the amount  to be paid as a deposit on a purchase order. Dues from a vendor are the  amount to be paid as deposit on a debit order and the amount to be refunded  on a debit memo.



Specify the payment method to be used when amounts are applied using  the document payment/refund options from the document profiles. It is  not used in journals.
