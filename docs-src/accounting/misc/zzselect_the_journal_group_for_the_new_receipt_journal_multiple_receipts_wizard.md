This option is enabled only if you have opted to create a new journal. Specify a journal group to which the receipts/refunds belong. The Journal Group specified in the **Workstation Settings** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Workstation Settings** > **Company Settings** tab > **Journal** **Group** field) of the user creating the transaction is displayed by default in this field.
