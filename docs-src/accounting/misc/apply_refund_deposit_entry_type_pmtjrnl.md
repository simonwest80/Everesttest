# Refund Deposit


Select this option if the vendor is refunding a deposit made on an earlier purchase order.


When this entry type is selected:

- The document number to be specified in the **Document #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section is the **Purchase Order** number.
- The **Vendor deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be credited.
- The **Credit** column automatically displays the amount of deposit on the selected purchase order (that has not yet been applied to other documents).
