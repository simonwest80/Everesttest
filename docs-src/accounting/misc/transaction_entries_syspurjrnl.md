# Transaction Entries


**Short/Over**
: This field displays the amount by which the transaction  is not balanced (i.e. the amount of difference between the debits and  credits). This amount is automatically computed. This field displays 'zero'  for entries created in a system journal.


**Account**
: The account that is debited or credited is displayed  in this column.


**Description**
: The name of the account is displayed in this column.


**Loc/Sub-Loc**
: The location or sub-location to which the amount  has been allocated is displayed in this column. The location/sub-location  identifies the cost centers or profit centers for an expense or revenue  account. Locations/Sub-Locations can be assigned only to income and expense  accounts.


**Entry Type**
: Additional information about the accounting entry  displays in this column.


{:.example}
The ACP account can have an entry type of  “Accrued Purchases” or “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”. This column allows  you to easily view price adjustments. The accrued purchases adjustment  to the Purchase Price Variance account due to a price change offsets the  accrued purchases adjustment to the Accrued Purchases account.


**Notes**
: This column displays additional details about the  accounting entry. Notes are not automatically generated for system entries.


**Job Code**
: The job code to which the amount of purchase or  purchase returns is allocated, is displayed in this column.

**Debit and Credit**
: The amount that is debited is displayed in the **Debit** column while the amount that is  credited is displayed in the **Credit**  column. An account cannot be debited and credited in the same transaction  entry. The debit and credit amounts for foreign currency documents are  displayed in foreign currency. To view the transaction in base currency,<font style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000"> </font>select **Options 
 &gt; Base Currency** from the **Purchase
