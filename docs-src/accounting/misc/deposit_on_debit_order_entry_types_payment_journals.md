# Deposit On Debit Order


Select this option if you receive a deposit from the vendor on an existing  debit order.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Debit 
 Order** number should be specified in the **Document 
 #** column of the **Transaction Entries**  section.
- The **Vendor 
 deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting 
 &gt; Accounts** tab) can only be credited.
- The **Credit** column automatically displays the balance amount that can be paid  on the debit order. The balance amount is the difference between the total  value of the debit order and the amount already received as a deposit  on the order.
