# Period Details


**Period Selection**
: Use this field to specify the period (such as the  month or week, depending on how you have defined your fiscal year and  periods) up to which the year should be closed. This is a mandatory field.
: The number of accounting periods that are NOT closed  is displayed by default in this field. This can be changed as required.


{:.example}
If your financial year comprises 6 months  that have not been closed, this field displays 6.
: If the year preceding the login date's financial  year has been closed, this field displays the number of accounting periods  before the log-in date.


{:.example}
If the financial year 2000 has been closed  and your log-in date is November 15, 2001, this field displays 10.
: A year can also be partially closed by selecting  the required period up to which the financial year should be closed.


{:.example}
If you want to close the first three months  of year 2001, specify 3 in this field. When you run the year end closing  process the next time, this field displays the balance accounting periods  i.e., 9 by default.
: If you are partially closing a year, you have to  specify the **New Year code** and  **Description** to create a new year  that will contain the remaining open periods.


**New Year Code**
: Use this field to create a new year comprising the  balance periods of a partially closed year. This field is enabled when  you are partially closing a year. Use a unique alphanumeric code to identify  the fiscal year. The code can span upto  a maximum of 15 characters. Once saved this field cannot be modified.  The new year appears in the **Fiscal Period 
 Setup** dialog box.


{:.example}
If you have closed the first three months  in year 2000 and specified the new year as '2000 A',  this year is displayed as a fiscal year comprising the balance 9 months.
