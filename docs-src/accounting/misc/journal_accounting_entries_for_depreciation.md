# Journal - Accounting Entries for Depreciation


Accounting entries for depreciation are entered in an open general journal  that fulfills the following conditions:

- The journal's  accounting period must correspond with the transaction date.
- The journal  must have the same journal group as the one selected in **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Workstation Settings** >  **Company Settings** tab > **Journal** **Group**  field) of the user creating the depreciation entry.
- The journal  must have the same location/sub-location as the login location/sub-location  of the user entering the making the depreciation.
- The journal  must have the description 'Depreciation'.



If no such open journal exists, a new general journal is created. The  general journal number for the new journal is taken from the sequence  number specified for general journals in the login location or the parent  location of the login sub-location.

If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or the parent  location of the login sub-location, the sequence number assigned to the  default location (path: **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field) is assigned  to the document.
