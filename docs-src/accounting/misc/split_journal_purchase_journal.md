# Split Purchase Journals


You can split journals so that the selected transaction(s)  are moved to a new journal. This option is useful in the following cases:

- When you want  to post only some transactions in a journal. You can then split the journal  and post the required transactions.
- When the journal  that is not posted contains too many transactions and you want to reduce  the number.



The original journal must have at least one transaction after splitting.  A new journal is created with the same journal information as the original  journal but with a new journal number.
