Specify the account to use for all rounding differences, including tax  rounding differences. In situations where an amount in a document differs  from the rounded-off amount in the appropriate account, the difference  is debited or credited to the account selected in the **Rounding 
 Differences** field. All revenue, expense, asset and liability accounts,  except the control accounts, are available for selection. This is a mandatory  field.
