---


This is the unique number used to identify this journal, and is automatically  generated when the details for the adjustment transaction are saved.


This transaction is saved as a general journal. When a new general journal  is created, the number assigned is the next number in sequence that has  been specified for general journals in the login location or parent location  of the login sub-location.


If sequence numbers are not defined for the login location or parent  location of the login sub-location, the sequence number assigned to the  default location (path: **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field) is assigned  to the document.
