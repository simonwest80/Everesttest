# Document Tracking


This option allows you to tag the document with the appropriate tracking  selections for the tracking groups available for the document type. You  can only view selections and cannot change selections if the tracking  group is in a view only mode for that document type. When you select this  option, the **Custom Tracking - Document** dialog box is displayed.
