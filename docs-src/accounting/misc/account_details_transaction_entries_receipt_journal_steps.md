# Account Details


**Account**
: The account that is being debited or credited is displayed in this column. You can manually select an account only if **Miscellaneous Receipt** has been selected in the **Entry Type** column.
: By default, the first line entry defaults to the bank or cash account specified in the payment method (selected in the **Payment Type** field).
: The first line in the **Transaction Entries** section cannot be deleted. Only detailed accounts that have the same currency as the customer's currency are available for selection.

**Debit and Credit**
: Enter the amount being debited in the **Debit** column while the amount being credited is entered in the **Credit** column. An account cannot be debited and credited in the same transaction entry.
: In the case of foreign currency customers, the amount can be entered in foreign currency or the base currency. You must enter the amounts in foreign currency by default. To enter the amount in base currency, select **Options &gt; View in Foreign Currency** from the **Receipt Journal** profile.
: The number of decimals that can be entered depends on the settings made in the **Currency** profile (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Accounting** > **Multi**-**currency** > **Currency** > **Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window** > **Decimals to display** field).
