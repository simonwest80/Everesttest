title: Header/Detail

Specify whether you want to view the header or detail transactions in  a journal or both.


The "Header" is the first entry in any journal and is highlighted  in green on the journal profile. If you select **Header**,  only the single header entry with the total transaction amount is displayed.


"Detail" indicates all entries after the header in a journal  transaction. If you select **Detail**,  all other entries for the transaction in a journal are displayed.


If you select "Both", header and transaction entry details  are displayed in the **Account Activity**  browser.

 Activity** browser by the **Journal#**  and **Transaction#** columns.
