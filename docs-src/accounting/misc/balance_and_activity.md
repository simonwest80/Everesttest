# Balance and Activity


The **Balance** option displays the account balances for each period. The **Activity** option displays the movement of the account in each period.


If the **Balance** option is selected, the budgeted, actual and variance balances in the account are displayed for each period in the selected fiscal year. When this option is selected, the **Budget activity** and **Actual activity** columns are renamed to **Budget balance** and **Actual balance**. Similarly the history columns also change.


Click on this button to toggle between the **Activity** and **Balance** options.
