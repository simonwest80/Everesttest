# The Sales Journal Transactions Browser


This browser lists all the transactions in the journal and displays  details such as the customer code, document type and amounts debited or  credited.


The **Sales Journal Transactions** browser  has the following additional options:

- **Split 
 Journal** - If an unposted journal contains too many transactions,  you may split the journal. Splitting the journal moves the selected transaction(s)  into a new journal.
