# Gain/Loss on Deposit


The Gain on Deposit and Loss on Deposit entries are accounting entry  types that the system uses to compensate for a gain or loss on a multi-currency  transaction due to changes in the exchange rate.


The system uses one of these entry types in the following two scenarios  if the exchange rate when you accepted the deposit(s) differs from the  exchange rate of the final document or the refund:

- You apply the deposit  that is received on a multi-currency order document to a final document
- You refund the  deposit on a multi-currency order



The gain and loss entry types are seen only when you view the accounting  journals in the base currency.


You specify which accounts to use for multi-currency gain and loss on  the **Multi-Currency** tab of the  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Accounting** menu.
