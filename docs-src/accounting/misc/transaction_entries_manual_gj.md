**Job Code**

**Allocate**
: Select the **Allocate**  check box for the transaction entries that you would like to distribute  or “allocate” among accounts based on a percentage. The total percentage  of these accounts should equal 100%.


**% Allocation**
: For the accounts that you have selected to allocate  by marking the check box in the **Allocation**  field, you must enter a percentage in the **% 
 Allocation** field. The total percentage of these accounts should  equal 100%. The Debit/Credit amounts automatically calculate based on  the percentages entered.


**Debit  and Credit**
: Enter the amount being debited in the **Debit**  column, while the amount being credited is entered in the **Credit**  column. One account cannot be debited and credited in the same transaction  entry.
: The amount can be entered in foreign currency or  the base currency if the selected account has been defined as a foreign  currency account.
