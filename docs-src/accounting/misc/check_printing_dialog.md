# The Check Printing Dialog Box


The **Check Printing** dialog box  allows you to specify the check number and date. If you select multiple  journals before selecting the **Print Checks**  option, you are prompted with this dialog box once for every journal that  you highlight. This is to ensure that you can use appropriate pre-printed  stationery for printing the checks, if different bank accounts are selected  in the journals.


**Journal #**
: The payment/receipt journal number is displayed  in this field. This field cannot be edited.


**Bank account**
: The bank account from which the payment is being  made is displayed in this field. This is a display field.


**Next Check #**
: Enter the check number from which you want the printing  to commence. By default, the next check number for the bank account selected  in the payment/receipt journal is displayed in this field. You can change  this number if required.

If you have issued one of the checks in  a series manually, you will have to enter the next number in this field.  For instance, if you have printed checks upto  check # 2000 and you issue check number 2001 manually, you must enter  2002 in this field when you are issuing the next check.
: Checks are printed in order of the transaction number.  Thus the first check will be used for the first transaction, the second  for the next and so on.


Date Assignment


**Check Date**
: Specify the date of the check in this field.


**Assign above date to check(s)  without dates**
: Select this option to print the above date (on checks),  if the check date is not specified in the payment journal. The check will  otherwise be printed with the date specified in the **Date**  field of the **Check Display Section**  in the payment/receipt journal.


**Assign above date to all check(s)**
: Select this option to print the above date on all  checks irrespective of whether a check date is specified in the payment/receipt  journal.


**Printer**
: Select a printer in this field.
