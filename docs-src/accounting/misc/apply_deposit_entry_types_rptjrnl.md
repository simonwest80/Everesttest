# Apply Deposit


Select this option if a deposit received from a customer on a sales  order has to be applied to a sales invoice or another sales order. When  you select this option the Accounts Receivable account will be credited  and the Customer Deposit account will be debited.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Customer 
 deposit** account specified in the **Accounting**  dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be debited.
- The **Sales 
 Order** number must be specified in the **Document 
 #** column of the **Transaction Entries**  section.



{:.hint}
When you select **Apply 
 Deposit** option, you will have to follow it with a transaction entry  of type [Payment on  Invoice.]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/payment_on_invoice_entry_types_rptjrnl.html) or [Deposit  on Sales Order]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/deposit_on_sales_order_entry_types_rptjrnl.html).

- The **Debit** column automatically displays the amount of deposit received  on the selected sales order that has not yet been applied to other documents.
