# The Receipt Journal Transactions Browser


This browser is displayed when the **List 
 Transaction** option (path: **Unposted 
 Receipt Journals** browser > **Options**  > **List Transaction**) is selected.  The **Receipt Journal Transactions** browser  lists all the transactions in the journal with details such as the customer  code, document type and amounts debited or credited.


If payment is received through a credit card, the card number is displayed  in the **Reference** column. Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).


The **Receipts Journals Transactions** has the following additional options:

- **Select 
 All / Unselect 
 All** - Use this option to select or de-select all the records in  the browser. This is a toggle option.
- **Print 
 Check** - You can print the check for each refund transaction separately  from this browser. You can also print multiple checks by highlighting  the required transactions and selecting the **Print 
 Check** option.

- **Split 
 Journal** - If a journal that is not posted contains too many transactions,  you may split the journal. Splitting the journal moves the selected transaction(s)  into a new journal.
