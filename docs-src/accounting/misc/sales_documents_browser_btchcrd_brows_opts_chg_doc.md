# Sales Documents Browser


This browser is displayed when you select **Change 
 Document** from the **Batch Payment 
 Process Browser**. The **Sales Documents**  browser displays all unpaid documents created for the selected customer.


You can apply the payment being received to another document from the  **Sales Documents** browser.


If you select another document, the **Document 
 #** column in the **Batch Payment 
 Process Browser** is updated. When you process the transaction, the  payment is applied to the new document and the balance on the new document  accordingly reduces.
