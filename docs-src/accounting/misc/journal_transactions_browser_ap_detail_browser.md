# Journal Transactions Browser


The **Journal Transactions** browser  is displayed when you select **Options 
 &gt; Journal Transactions** from the **A/P Details** browser.


This browser displays the accounting entry created in the system when  the purchase invoice/debit memo is saved. The browser displays details  such as the accounts that are debited or credited, amount of debit/credit,  the purchase journal and transaction number in which the entry was recorded,  the document number and date and the source of the transaction.


Use the option **View in Base Currency**  (path: **Journal Transactions** browser  > **Options**) to view the amounts  in base currency. This is a toggle option that also allows you to view  the amounts in the vendor's currency.
