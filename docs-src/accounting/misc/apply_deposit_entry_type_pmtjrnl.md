 Order** number should be specified in the **Document

 Deposit** option, you will have to follow it with a transaction entry  of type [Payment  on Purchase Invoice]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/payment_on_purchase_receipt_entrytype_pmtjrnl.html) or [Deposit  on Purchase Order]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/misc/deposit_on_purchase_order_entrytype_pmtjrnl.html).
