# Discount Details


**Discount Date**
: The date before which the payment must be made (to  the vendor) in order to be eligible for a discount is displayed. This  date is computed only if the document's payment term allows discounts.  This date is determined based on the **Discount 
 Type** specified on the [**Payment Terms** profile]({{site.sc_chm}}/options/payment-information/payment-terms/set-up-a-payment-term/payment_terms_profile_general_tab.html) (of the document's  payment term).


**Discount Available**
: Based on the payment terms, the total amount of  discount available is displayed in this column. The number of days considered  for calculating discounts is calculated from the login date to the vendor's  invoice date or purchase invoice date depending on whether the option  **Calculate due date from purchase invoice 
 date** is selected.
: In the case of manual documents the discount is  computed from the document date. This amount is displayed for information  purposes only.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)  To  account for the payment discount received from the vendor, insert another  transaction entry with transaction type as “Payment Discount”.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  The  **Discount Date** and **Discount 
 Available** fields have data only if the document is a final document.
