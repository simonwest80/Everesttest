# Advantages of Maintaining Journals


**Everest** creates journals since there are certain advantages of maintaining journals instead of directly posting entries to accounts. These advantages are:

- Transactions can be viewed in the chronological order of creation, in its entirety.
- Transactions can be reviewed before posting to the accounts.
- Journals can be printed for the purpose of maintaining an audit trail.
- Different locations can maintain their own set of journals for entry and review.
