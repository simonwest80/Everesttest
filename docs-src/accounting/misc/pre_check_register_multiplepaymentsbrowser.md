# Pre-Check Register


This option allows you to print a register of the checks. Doing so allows  you to review and perhaps process for approval, the payment/receipt information.  The report not only lists the names of the vendors/customers who are being  paid, but other details as well:

- The individual  documents that are being paid and the amount of payment on each document.
- The balance  due for each document.
- The total being  paid for each vendor/customer as well as a grand total for all vendors/customers.
