If you have issued one of the checks in a  series manually, you will have to enter the next number in this field.  For instance, if you have printed checks upto  check # 2000 and you issue check number 2001 manually, you must enter  2002 in this field when you are issuing the next check.


Checks are printed in order of the transaction number. Thus the first  check will be used for the first transaction, the second for the next  and so on.
