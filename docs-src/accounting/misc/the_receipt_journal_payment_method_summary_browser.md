# The Receipt Journal Payment Method Summary Browser


This browser is displayed when the **Payment 
 Method (Summary)** option (path: **Unposted 
 Receipt Journals** browser > **Options** > **Transactions** >  **Payment Method (Summary)**) is selected.


The **Receipt Journal Payment Method 
 Summary** browser lists all the payment methods through which payments  have been received from customers or refunds made to customers, and also  the net amount debited or credited with that payment method.


A net credit (indicated by 'CR'  in the **Type** column) denotes that  the payments made through the selected method exceed receipts with that  method. A net debit (indicated by 'DR' in the **Type** column) denotes that receipts exceed payments.


Options common to all browsers are available in this browser.
