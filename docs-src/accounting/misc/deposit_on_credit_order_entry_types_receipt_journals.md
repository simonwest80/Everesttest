# Deposit On Credit Order


Select this option if you make a deposit to a customer on an existing credit order.


When this entry type is selected:

- The **Credit Order** number must be specified in the **Document #** column of the **Transaction Entries** section.
- The **Customer deposit** account specified in the **Accounting** dialog box (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting**) can only be debited.
- The **Debit** column automatically displays the balance amount that can be refunded on the credit order. The balance amount is the difference between the total value of the credit order and the amount already received as a deposit on the order.
