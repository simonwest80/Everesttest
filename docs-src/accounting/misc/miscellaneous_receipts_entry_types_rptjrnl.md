# Miscellaneous Receipts


Select this option when you want to receive payment from the customer  by selecting a General Ledger account of your choice without creating  a sales invoice.
: **&nbsp;**Such  payments are not recorded in the customer transaction history since the  receipt is not associated with any document.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â Sale  of recycled paper can be accounted as miscellaneous receipts.


When this entry type is selected:

- The required  account may be selected and debited or credited.
- A document  number cannot be specified since this is a direct receipt for an expense  and the Account Receivable account is not credited.
