# Save an Incomplete Reconciliation


The **Mark Reconciled** option will  be displayed only when the statement is reconciled with the bank account.  You can quit the reconciliation process at any point of time and return  to it at a later date.


{:.steps}
To save the incomplete reconciliation, do  the following:

- From the **Bank Reconciliation** browser, select  **Options &gt; Save**.
- **Everest**  prompts you to confirm whether the incomplete reconciliation details have  to be saved.
- Click **Yes** to save the details. Click **No** to exit the reconciliation without  saving any details. Click **Cancel**  to return to the **Bank Reconciliation**  browser and continue with the process of reconciliation.



When you return to the reconciliation, the statement balance and the  entries tagged will be automatically displayed.
