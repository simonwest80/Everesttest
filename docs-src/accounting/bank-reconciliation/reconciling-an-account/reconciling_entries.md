# Reconciling Transactions


To select the transactions for reconciliation, you must tag the checks/deposits  that have been cleared.


{:.steps}
To tag a payment or deposit, do the following:

- From the **Bank Reconciliation** browser, highlight  the required transaction and select **Mark 
 Selection** from the right-click menu.
- You will see  a check mark beside the selected transactions.



As you tag the payments/deposits that have been cleared, the summary  section displayed in the right side of the browser will be updated. You  are also provided with a calculator in the **Bank 
 Reconciliation** browser to enable computations.


If certain charges such as bank fees have not been accounted, select  **Options &gt; Adjustment Entries** to  account for the same.
