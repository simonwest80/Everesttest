# Unreconciled Checks


This section lists all the checks that have not been marked as reconciled in the period being closed.


Click **Ignore** to proceed to the [**Finish**]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/year-end-closing/year-close-wizard/finish_year_close_wizard.html) section.


When you click **Ignore**, the unreconciled checks appear in your bank reconciliation as 'unreconciled', in the following year.
