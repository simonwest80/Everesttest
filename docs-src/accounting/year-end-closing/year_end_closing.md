# Year end Closing


Closing an accounting year, briefly stated, is the permanent process  of clearing out revenue and expense accounts and transferring their net  balance to the Retained Earnings account. Unlike closing periods which  prevents further transaction entries, 'year end closing'  closes the accounts so that no further modifications can be made to them.  However if a closed year is reopened, you can modify and view existing  transactions and also add new transactions.


The books of accounts can be closed for a specified period or for the  fiscal year. During year end closing, the following processes take place:

- All asset,  liability and capital accounts are transferred to the following fiscal  year.
- Revenue and  expense accounts are zeroed out by transferring their balances to the  Retained Earnings account. All expense and income accounts will have a  zero balance at the beginning of the following year.



![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  **Everest** allows  multiple open years. But unless a year is closed, the balances of the  income and expense accounts would be carried forward to the next year.  The income and expense accounts are zeroed out ONLY if the year end closing  process is carried out.


If you want the income and expense accounts  for a year to start with a zero balance without going through the year  closing process, you must create a general journal entry to manually zero  out the balances. You must create this entry as the last transaction in  the year whose balances are being zeroed out.


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)  It  is recommended that if you create a manual entry, you use an 'Income Suspense  Account' to  transfer the net profit or loss. The 'Income Suspense Account'  must be a 'Revenue' or 'Expense'  type of account. The accounting entry in this case would be:


| All Revenue Accounts | Debit |
| All Expense Accounts | Credit |
| Income Suspense Account | Debit (for net loss) |
| Income Suspense Account | Credit (for net gain) |



When you use the **Year 
 End &gt; Close Year** option, **Everest** will transfer the balance from the 'Income Suspense Account'  to the 'Retained Earnings Account'.


If your company has foreign currency assets and liabilities, you might  want to run the [Account  Re-measurement wizard]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/account-remeasurement/account_remeasurement_accounting.html) to account for the changes in the values due  to exchange rate fluctuations.
