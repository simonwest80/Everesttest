# Open Old Year


<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Accounts for an old year can be reopened to:</font>

- <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Modify, view and print old transactions</font>
- <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Add new transactions.</font>



<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Opening a closed year will delete the accounting 
 entries created during the year closing process. </font><font color="#000000" class="hcp1">You can only reopen the latest year that was closed.</font>


![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â If  you close all years upto  2002, then you cannot reopen the year 2000 without first reopening 2001.


In order to maintain an audit trail, when you open a  closed year, the "Closed year reopened" event is triggered.
