# Everest Accounting Philosophy


The accounting philosophy of **Everest**  is woven around:

- **Simplicity**  - The accounting function is simplified by integrating it with transaction  processing. You do not need to therefore, create accounting entries manually.  They are automatically created in **Everest**  when:


- A final document  is created in the sales, purchase, customer return or vendor return processes.
- Payments are received  from customers and payments are made to vendors.
- Adjustments are made  to inventory.


- **Real 
 time information** - **Everest** provides  you real time information on critical accounting areas such as:


- Customer and vendor  balances.
- Amounts outstanding  on sales and purchase documents.
- Customer and vendor  deposits.


- **Automation 
 without sacrificing the advantages of tradition** - **Everest**  provides you real time information by automating the accounting process,  but not at the cost of the advantages that traditional accounting methods  provide. **Everest** follows the time-honored  concept of entering all transactions in appropriate journals first. Entries  are posted to the ledger only when you decide to do so. This allows you  to review the entries before posting them to the accounts.
