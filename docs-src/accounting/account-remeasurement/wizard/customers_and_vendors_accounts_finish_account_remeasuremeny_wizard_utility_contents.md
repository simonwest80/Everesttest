# Remeasure Customer and Vendor Accounts


The impact of a fluctuation in exchange rates for foreign currency customer  and vendor accounts is measured the same way as foreign currency asset  and liability accounts. The difference is that the impact is measured  based on the balance for each outstanding document of the customer and  vendor.
