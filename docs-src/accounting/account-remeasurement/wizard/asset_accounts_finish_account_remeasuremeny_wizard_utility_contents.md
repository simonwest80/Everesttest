# Remeasure Asset Accounts


The impact of fluctuation in exchange rate for foreign currency asset  account balances is measured by:

- Converting  the current foreign currency balance of the asset account to base currency  using the exchange rate for the currency entered in the **Exchange 
 Rates** section.
- The current  converted balances in base currency of all asset accounts are totaled.
- The balance  in base currency of these accounts is deducted from the current converted  balance. If the result is positive, there is a gain on remeasurement.  If the result is negative, there is a loss on remeasurement.
