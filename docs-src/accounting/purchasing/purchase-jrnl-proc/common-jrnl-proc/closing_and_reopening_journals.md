# Lock and Open Journals


A journal's status can either be 'Open' or 'Locked'. An open journal  is one that is available for transaction entry. You would mark a journal  as locked when transactions no longer need to be made to that journal.

**Everest** will append system generated  transactions to the first related open journal of the accounting period  in question. If a journal is locked, it is closed for system transactions  and another journal is created for any new system generated transactions.


Only the status of journals that are not posted can be modified.


**When would you lock a journal?**


You might want **Everest** to generate  the transactions in a different journal for a variety of reasons.

- Journals are  normally locked at the end of an accounting period. However, if the number  of transactions grows too large, you may decide to lock it before the  accounting period.
- Journals created  for a specific purpose such as accounting for adjusting entries, accounting  for writing off old customer balances or miscellaneous purchases are locked  when all transactions required have been added to the journal.
- Journals may  also be locked after printing to ensure that new entries are not added;  as new entries may not be printed.
- Journals may  be locked after you verify them to ensure that no new entries are added.
