You can access all unposted Purchase Journals here:  **Accounting** > **Accounts****Payable** > **Purchase****Journal.** To post, go to **Options** > **Post** **Journal(s)**.

Everest does not allow you to post a journal which is not balanced (the  total credits do not equal the total debits). If there are short/over  amounts the journal will not post. In this case, simply balance the journal  and start the posting process again.


In addition, several other conditions will prevent the journal from  posting. See the **Remarks** descriptions  in the **Journal Posting Results**  information.

We recommend that you print and review each journal before posting it,  although by default Everest will let  you  post a journal without printing it first. You can deselect the preference  **Allow user to post a journal even if 
 it is not printed** to prevent Everest from posting an unprinted  journal. Make this change in the Other Flow Control preferences (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow 
 Control** > **Other Flow Control 
 &gt; General** tab).


When Everest posts a journal, the respective chart of accounts updates  with the transactions contained in the journal. In the case of foreign  currency documents, the account balances update in both base and foreign  currency.
