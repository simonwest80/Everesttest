# Modify System Purchase Journals


System purchase journals cannot be modified. They can only be viewed.


You can modify system journals only by changing the purchase receipt/invoice  or debit memo from which the particular transaction is created. Changes  can be made to a document only till the journal (pertaining to the document)  is posted.


When you modify a purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo, the existing  accounting entry is replaced with the accounting entry required for the  modified purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo. Vendor balances are updated  accordingly.
