# Purge Manual Purchase Journals


Manual purchase journals can be purged only if they are not posted.  When you purge a journal:

- All transactions  entered in the journal are deleted.
- The journal  ceases to exist.



You cannot purge a purchase journal that accounts for manual purchase  invoices/debit memos against which a payment has been made/received.
