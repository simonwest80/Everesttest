# Purchasing - Documents/ Manual Entries


Differences between creating documents and manual entries are listed  below:

- When items  are received through a purchase receipt, purchased through a purchase  invoice, or returned through a debit memo, inventory costs and values  of the items are affected. Manual entries affect only the accounts payable  and vendor balances.
- Gain or loss  on vendor returns is automatically calculated when a debit memo is created,  but it has to be manually calculated and entered when making a manual  entry.
