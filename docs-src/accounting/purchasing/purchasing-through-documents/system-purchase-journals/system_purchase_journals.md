# System Purchase Journals 


System journals relating to purchase and purchase returns are created  when:

- Purchase receipts  are created.
- Purchase invoices  are created.
- Debit memos  are created.



You can neither append a manual transaction to a system purchase journal,  nor can you modify it. You can only view the transactions.

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; Account 
 Payable &gt; Purchase Journal**. You will see the **Unposted 
 Purchase Journals** browser listing all purchase journals that are  not yet posted.
