# Accounting Entries - Purchase Receipt


The accounting entries that are created when a purchase receipt is created  depend on the inventory type of the items purchased.


The accounting entries are categorized under the following:

- [Accounting  Entry for Inventoried Items]({{site.pp_chm}}/misc/entry_for_inventoried_items_create_a_pr.html)
- [Accounting  Entry for Non-inventoried Items]({{site.pp_chm}}/misc/entry_for_non_inventoried_items_create_a_pr.html)



**Accounting Entries for Documents Containing Line  Items Associated to Different Accounts**


A purchase receipt/invoice or debit memo may consist of more than one  line item with different accounts to be debited for purchase cost or taxes.  A transaction entry is generated for each account by accumulating the  amounts for each account.


At the document level you can identify the location or sub-location  to which the income or expense account pertains to in the **Loc/Sub-Loc** column of the items details grid.

Since expense and income accounts can be accounted for each location/sub-location  separately, the amounts for such type of accounts are accumulated for  each account and location combination.


If job codes are assigned to the line item, then amounts are accumulated  for each account, location/sub-location and job code combination separately.
