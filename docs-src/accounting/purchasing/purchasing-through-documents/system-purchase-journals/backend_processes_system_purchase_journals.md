# Back End Processes - System Purchase Journals


The following processes occur in the back end when a purchase invoice/debit  memo is created:

- When you create  a purchase invoice, the vendor's unposted amount viewed in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing** >  **Vendors** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Accounting** tab  > **Unposted Amount** field) increases  by the amount credited and the net balance increases.
- When you create  a debit memo, the vendor's unposted amount viewed in the **Vendor**  profile decreases by the amount debited and the net balance decreases.
