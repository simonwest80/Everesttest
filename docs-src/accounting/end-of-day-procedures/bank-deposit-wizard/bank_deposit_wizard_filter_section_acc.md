# Bank Deposit Wizard - Filter Section


The Filter Section


The **Filter** section  is used to filter your undeposited collections. The undeposited collections  for the payment methods and dates that you select appear below the filter  in the Top Grid. Select the receipts to be deposited, indicate the bank  account for the deposit, and enter adjustments, if necessary, in the Bottom  grid. Save your changes to make the deposit.


**Payment Method**
: The **Payment Method**  field allows you to select all active payment methods defined in Everest.  Click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/browse_button_acc.gif) button to view the **Selection**  dialog box. The Selection dialog box lists all the payment methods in  **Everest**. Select the payment methods  for the deposit in this dialog box and click **OK**.

{:.example}
A store manager needs to quickly total the  cash and checks collected to make a deposit on the way home. The store  manager selects the cash and checks payment options in the Selection dialog  box.


**Currency**
: Displays the base currency defined in **Everest**.  Only undeposited receipts in the base currency display in your filter  results.


**Dates – From and To**
: The date filter has the usual options available  in **Everest** browsers. This filter  displays “**Today”** by default. You  can select **Custom** in the **Dates** field and define the required  date range in the From and To drop-down calendars.


After setting the payment method and date filter, you will  see a list of all the receipts for the defined payment method and period  in the Top grid of the Bank Deposit Wizard. Only undeposited receipts,  unreconciled entries, and receipts for the base currency display in your  filter results.
