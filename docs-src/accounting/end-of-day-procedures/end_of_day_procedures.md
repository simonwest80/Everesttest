# End of the Day Procedures


It is important to have a systematic procedure to verify transactions for a standard workday. The daily accounting transactions are recorded in the accounting journals just for this purpose. It is up to the accounting department to verify the daily transactions within the journals prior to making final postings to the general ledger.


For most organizations, the end of day also signifies a critical point for their business. Most organizations use special end of the day procedures to prepare for the next business day. Some of most common end of day procedures include:

- Closing and reconciling point-of-sale registers.
- Preparing bank deposits.
- Printing and reviewing the transactions for the day.
- Posting the daily transactions to the general ledger.
- Printing and filing daily sales and profit figures.
