# How do I Create a Memorized Transactions Template?


Memorized transaction templates are models of journal profile  transactions used to quickly and easily create journal transactions. You  can create these templates from a new or existing unposted journal profile  or from the **Memorized Transactions**  browser. You cannot select control accounts in your template.


{:.example}
A company pays $120 for annual car insurance. They credit the vendor  for $120, debit Prepaid Insurance, and send a check to the vendor for  $120. At the end of each month, in the General Journal, they must credit  Prepaid Insurance and debit Insurance Expense for $10. Instead of manually  entering these GL transactions each month, they open a new general journal,  add the monthly transactions, and use the “Memorize Transactions” option  to save these as a template called “Monthly Car Insurance Expense”.


At the end of every month, they can open a new General Journal profile  and use the “Retrieve Memorized Transactions” option to retrieve these  transactions into the GL. They modify the date and description and save  the GL profile. This saves them precious time at the busy end of the month.


{:.steps}
To create a transaction template from a journal  profile, do the following:

- From any new unposted  journal profile, enter the necessary details for your template including  the description and transaction entries. For existing unposted journal  profiles, you may just want to make slight adjustments as needed.

- Click **OK**  to save (“memorize”) your template. You have now created a template that  can be reused multiple times. You will return to the profile that you  created the template from. At this point you can save the journal to create  it now (new profiles) or you can exit the journal profile without saving.
