# Memorized Transactions Template Profile – Schedule Tab


Use the **Schedule**  tab of your memorized transactions profile (path: **Accounting**  > **Memorized** **Transactions**  > Open a memorized transactions profile from this browser) to schedule  reminders to be sent to assigned users. Users can easily process these  transactions from the reminders. Only users with the appropriate security  rights can schedule the memorized transaction template.
