Users can process  the transactions from the reminders they receive or directly from this  browser. Â From  this browser, you can select multiple occurrences and process them all  at the same time.


Only users with the appropriate security rights can view  the **Scheduled Transactions** browser.  Additional security rights are required to process the transactions from  this browser.
