# Scheduled Transaction Reminders


Reminders are sent to assigned users for each occurrence  of scheduled transactions to be processed. Accounting Staff can quickly  and easily start the automated processing for the scheduled transactions  from the reminder notices.


These reminders are scheduled on the **Schedule**  tab of the **Memorized Transaction Template**  profile (path: **Accounting** >  **Memorized Transactions** > Open  the memorized transactions template to view the profile).
