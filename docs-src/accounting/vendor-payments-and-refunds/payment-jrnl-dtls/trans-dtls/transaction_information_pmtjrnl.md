# Transaction Information


You can have one or more transactions per journal. You can navigate  between transactions in the same journal by clicking on the drop-down  arrow and selecting the required transaction number. After creating a  transaction select **Options &gt; New Transaction**  to create the next transaction.


**Transaction #**
: This is the unique number used to identify the transaction.  The transaction number is generated automatically by **Everest**.


**Date**
: This field denotes the transaction date for the  payment or refund.
: In the case of system entries made for document  payments, the date displays the login date when the payment/refund was  entered.


**Source**
: This field identifies the source type of the transaction.  The source types used when a system entry is made are:


| **Source Type** | Description |
| PAY | Payment for purchase (when payments are made against a purchase invoice,  either as a payment or by applying deposits/debit memos) |
| DGV | Deposit for Purchase Order (when deposits are made against a purchase  order, either as a payment or by applying deposits/debit memos) |
| DGR | Deposit returned for Purchase Order |
| PRT | Payment refunded for Purchase |
| DAY | Payment for Debit Memo (when a debit memo is refunded) |

: When creating a manual payment journal:

- The default  source type displayed is **MPA**(**Manual Payment Journal**)
- You can select  any other manual source type for the transaction

**Payment Type**
: This field identifies the payment method for the  transaction. The payment method is used to identify the entry type for  the bank account in the **Transaction Entries**  section.
: If you apply one purchase document to another, a  transaction is automatically created in a payment journal (for the amount  applied).

: The **Payment Type** field defaults to the payment method selected in the **Workstation Settings** dialog box > **Default Payment Method for Applied Payments** field (path: **File** >  **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Workstation Settings**).  If a payment method is not defined in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box, the payment method selected in the **Default 
 Payment Method for Applied Payments** field (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting**  > **Miscellaneous** tab) will be  used.
: **Manual Entries**
: This field defaults to the payment method specified  in the **Default payment method for Payments**  field of the **Accounting** dialog  box (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults** > **Accounting** > **Accounting** dialog box > **Miscellaneous**  tab).
: **Subsequent Entries**
: For subsequent entries in the journal, you can only  select payment methods that are attached to the account selected in the  **Bank** field. The payment method  for a new transaction defaults to the one selected in the previous transaction.
