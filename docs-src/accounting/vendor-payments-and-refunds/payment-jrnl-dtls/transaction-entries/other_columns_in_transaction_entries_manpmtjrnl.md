# Other Columns in Transaction Entries 


**Short/Over**
: This field indicates the amount by which the transaction  is out of balance (i.e. the amount of difference between the debits and  credits in the journal), and is automatically computed. If the amount  displayed is positive, the total debits exceed total credits; if the amount  is negative, then total credits exceed total debits.


**Check Box Column**
: This column allows you to select the documents to  be paid or refunded. Once you select a document, you can modify the amount  to be paid/refunded.


**Document #**
: This column displays the document against which  the payment/refund is being made. All documents that have an outstanding  balance are displayed. You can select multiple documents.


**Location/Sub-Location**
: The location or sub-location to which the amount  must be allocated is displayed in this column. The sub-location identifies  the cost centers or profit centers for an expense or revenue account.  Locations/sub-locations cannot be assigned to asset and liability accounts.


**Notes**
: Notes provide a brief description on the transaction.  You may enter a note for each entry.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  Notes  are not generated automatically for system entries.


**Job Code**
: This column identifies the job to which the payment/refund  has to be allocated.
: ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  You  cannot specify a job code for an entry that contains either an asset or  liability account.
