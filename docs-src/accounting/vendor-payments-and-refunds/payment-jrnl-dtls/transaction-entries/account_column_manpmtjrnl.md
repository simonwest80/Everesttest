**Debit and Credit**
: The amounts to be debited or credited must be entered  in this column.
: When a document is selected, the balance amount  payable/receivable is displayed in the appropriate column (either debit  or credit). You may change the amount of debit/credit. The entry type  determines whether the entry is a debit or credit.

: The amount for the bank entry displays the net amount  of debits and credits. It is the difference between the total debit and  credit for the subsequent entries. This is automatically calculated and  cannot be entered manually.
: Amounts entered in these columns automatically update  the amount payable to the vendor that is displayed in the check section.
