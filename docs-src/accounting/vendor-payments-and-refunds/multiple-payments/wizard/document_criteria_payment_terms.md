Click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_exclude_all.gif) button to move  all payment terms to the **Exclude**  column.


**Exclude**
: Documents that contain the payment terms specified  in this column are not included for payment. To include payment terms,  highlight the required payment terms and click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_include.gif) button.  To include all the payment terms contained in the **Exclude**  column for payment, click the ![]({{site.acc_baseurl}}/img/act_include_all.gif) button.
