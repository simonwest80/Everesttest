# Control of Checks


Payment is usually made by check, often in a multi-copy format. Using  a computer, may reduce the need for the extra copies. Nonetheless, you  may at least choose to keep a copy attached to the invoice and file by  vendor and/or by month. Additionally, you can keep the copies of the checks  in chronological order of the check numbers for easy retrieval at a later  date.


The most important controls in the payments function generally include:

- Limiting access  to the blank checks.
- Limiting access  to authorized persons (a security function you can set in **Everest**).
- The signing  of checks by an individual with proper authority i.e. the authorized signatory.
- Separation  of responsibility for preparing and signing of checks.
- Restricting  access to creation of payment or refund entries.
- Careful examination  of the supporting documentation by the person who signs the check (the  vendor invoice should agree with the purchase invoice document or transaction  you created in **Everest**).
- The checks  should be pre-numbered and printed on special paper that makes it difficult  to alter the check details like name or amount.
- Care should  be taken to physically control blank, voided, and signed checks before  they are mailed.
- It is also  important to have a method of canceling the supporting documents to prevent  their reuse as support for another check at a later time. A common method  is to write or stamp the check number on the supporting documents.
- Check with  your CPA and lawyer for the proper control of checks, check writing process,  etc, within your business operation.
