# Excerpts from Publication 15, Circular E: Employers Tax Guide (2009)


**“Reconciling Forms W-2, 
 W-3, and 941 or 944**. When there are discrepancies between Forms  941 or Form 944 filed with the IRS and Forms W-2 and W-3 filed with the  SSA, the IRS must contact you to resolve the discrepancies.


To help reduce discrepancies:


1.  Report  bonuses as wages and as social security and Medicare wages on Forms W-2  and on Form 941 or Form 944,


2.  Report  both social security and Medicare wages and taxes separately on Forms  W-2, W-3, 941, and 944,


3.  Report  employee share of social security taxes on Form W-2 in the box for social  security tax withheld (box 4), not as social security wages,


4.  Report  employee share of Medicare taxes on Form W-2 in the box for Medicare tax  withheld (box 6), as Medicare wages,


5.  Make  sure the social security wage amount for each employee does not exceed  the annual social security wage base limit (for example, $102,000 for  2008),


6.  Do  not report noncash wages that are not subject to social security or Medicare  taxes as social security or Medicare wages,


7.  If  you used an EIN on any Form 941 or Form 944 for the year that is different  from the EIN reported on Form W-3, enter the other EIN on Form W-3 in  the box for “Other EIN used this year,”


8.  Be  sure the amounts on Form W-3 are the total of amounts from Forms W-2,  and


9.  Reconcile  Form W-3 with your four quarterly Forms 941 or annual Form 944 by comparing  amounts ported for:


a.   Income  tax withholding;


b.   Social  security wages, social security tips, and Medicare wages and tips.  Form  W-3 should include Form 941 or Form 944 adjustments only for the current  year (that is, if the Form 941 or Form 944 adjustments include amounts  for a prior year, do not report those prior year adjustments on the current-year  Forms W-2 and W-3);


c.   Social  security and Medicare taxes. The amounts shown on the four quarterly Forms  941 or the annual Form 944, including current-year adjustments, should  be approximately twice the amounts shown on Form W-3. This is because  Form 941 and Form 944 include both the employer and employee shares of  social security and Medicare taxes; and


d.   Advance  earned income credit (EIC).


Do not report on Form 941 or Form 944 backup withholding  or income tax withholding on nonpayroll payments such as pensions, annuities,  and gambling winnings. Nonpayroll withholding must be reported on Form  945, Annual Return of Withheld Federal Income Tax. See the Instructions  for Form 945 for details. Income tax withholding required to be reported  on Forms 1099 or W-2G must be reported on Form 945. Only taxes and withholding  properly reported on Form W-2 should be reported on Form 941 or form 944.


Amounts reported on Forms W-2, W-3, and Forms 941 or Form  944 may not match for valid reasons. If they do not match, you should  determine that the reasons are valid.”


**Keep your reconciliation 
 in case there are inquiries from the IRS or the SSA.**
