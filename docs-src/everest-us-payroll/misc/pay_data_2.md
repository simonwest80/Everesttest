# Pay Data


**Pay Period**
: The employee's pay period identifies the frequency  of payments to the employee.


**Yearly Salary**
: This is the annual salary of the employee. The salary  for a pay period is calculated by dividing the yearly salary by the number  of pay periods in a year.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  an employee is paid weekly, and the yearly salary is $52000, then the  employee's weekly salary is $1000.


**Hourly Regular Rate**
: This is the rate at which the employee is paid for  regular hours worked.

 Pay** in the **Pay Details**  tab of the **Employee** profile.


**Hourly Overtime Rate**
