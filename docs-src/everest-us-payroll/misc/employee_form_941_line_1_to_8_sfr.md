A company has 50 employees as of Mar 12. A new employee with a monthly  pay period joins on Mar 10 and receives the first pay on April 01. Since  this pay period includes March 12 (March 01 - March 31), the employee  is included in the count.

An existing employee with a monthly pay period quits on Mar 10 and is  due for the last pay only on April 01. Since this pay period includes  March 12 (March 01 - March 31), the employee is included in the count.

A new employee with a semimonthly pay period joins on March 13 and receives  the first pay on March 16 (March 13 - March 15). Since this pay period  includes March 12, the employee is included in the count.

An existing employee with a semi-monthly pay period quits on March 13  and  is  due for the last pay on March 16 (March 13 - March 15). Since this pay  period includes March 12, the employee is included in the count.

A new employee with a daily pay period joins on March 13 and is due  for the first pay on March 14 (March 13 - March 13). Since this pay period  does not include March 12, the employee is NOT included in the count.

An existing employee with a daily pay period quits on March 13 and is  due for the last pay on March 14 (March 13 - March 13). Since the employee  was on the company rolls on March 12 the employee is included in the count.

An existing employee with a daily pay period quits on March 10 and is  due for the last pay on March 11 (March 10 - March 10). Since the employee  was not on the company rolls as of March 12 and thereby not paid for the  pay period including March 12, the employee is NOT included in the count.

This line displays the total wages, sick pay, or fringe benefits subject  to social security taxes paid to the employees during the quarter, prior  to making any deductions. Sick pay includes payments made by an insurance  company to your employees for which the insurance company has notified  you. Social Security tips are not included in this amount.


The rate of social security tax on taxable wages is 6.2 percent (.062)  each for the employer and employee, or 12.4 percent (.124) for both. You  can stop paying social security tax and reporting an employee's wages  on line 5a when the employee's taxable wages (including tips) reach the  social security wage base limit.


Column 1 of line 5a displays all payroll items of Type 'Addition', and  'Company Contributions' that are checked for 'Social Security'.


Calculate the taxable social security wages for each employee transaction  and then sum it for all the employee transactions in that quarter. Ensure  that the social security wages or the sum of social security wages and  tips does not exceed the social security wage base.


**![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) The value  displayed in line 5a should be equal to the sum of Form W2 - Box 3 for  all employees who have been paid in that quarter.**


Column 2 of line 5a is calculated by multiplying the figure in Column  1 by 0.124.

This line displays all the tips reported by employees to their employer  for that quarter.


An employee must report cash tips, including tips you paid the employee,  totaling $20 or more in a month. This must be done by the 10th of the  next month. For this purpose, employees may use Form 4070, Employee's  Report of Tips to Employer, or submit a written statement or electronic  tip record.


Do not include allocated tips on this line as they are not reportable  on Form 941 and not subject to withholding of income, social security,  or Medicare taxes. You can report allocated tips on Form 8027, Employer's  Annual Information Return of Tip Income and Allocated Tips.


To calculate the amount in column 1, first calculate the tips for each  employee transaction in each quarter, and then sum up the tips paid to  all employee in that quarter. Ensure that the tips individually or along  with the actual social security wages do not exceed the social security  wage base.


The value in column 2 of line 5b is calculated as the product of column  1 of line 5b and 0.1214.


The figure in line 5b should equal the total of Form W2 - Box 7 for  all employees for that quarter.


**![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) **Everest** calculates line 5b before calculating  line 5a. The tips for each employee transaction in Line 5b are considered  first and then Line 5b is compared against the social security wage base.  If Line 5b is less than the wage base, **Everest**  considers the social security wage portion in Line 5a, provided Line 5a,  individually or along with Line 5b, does not exceed the social security  wage base.**

Report all wages, tips, sick pay, and taxable fringe benefits that are  subject to Medicare tax in this line. Unlike social security wages, there  is no limit on the amount of wages subject to Medicare tax.


Include all tips your employees reported during the quarter, even if  you were unable to withhold the employee tax of 1.45%. However, continue  to withhold income and Medicare taxes for the whole year on wages and  tips even when the social security wage base ($106,800 for 2009) has been  reached.


The value in column two of line 5c is calculated as the product of column  1 of line 5c and 0.029.

This field displays the total of social security tax, social security  tips tax, and Medicare tax. In other words, it is the sum of lines 5a,  5b and 5c. You cannot edit this field.

: Employees whose date of wage payment (for the quarter)  is before the generation of Form 941 (for the quarter) must be included  in this count.


{:.example}
: A company employs 50 people as of March 12.  A new employee joins on April 1 and the employer generates Form 941 on  April 15. Form 941 must display 50 as the number of employees as of March  12, for the first quarter, and not 51 since the new employee was not on  payroll on March 12.
: A new employee with a monthly pay period  joins on Mar 10. If the new employee receives the first paycheck on April  15, but Form 941 is generated on April 08, which is prior to the date  of payment, the employee is not included in the count.


**2 Wages, tips and other compensation**
: This field displays all the payroll items of the  type additions and company contributions that are taxable to FITA.
: Omit supplemental unemployment compensation benefits  from this amount, even if you withheld income tax on them. Also, do not  include any contributions to employee plans if these are excluded from  the employee's wages; for example, retirement programs such as section  401(k) and 125 plans. If you run an insurance company, this entry should  not include any sick pay you paid your policyholder's employees.
: The amount for line 2 is calculated by summing up  the values in Form W2-Box 1 for all the employees for each quarter.


**3 Total income tax withheld from wages, tips  and other compensation**
