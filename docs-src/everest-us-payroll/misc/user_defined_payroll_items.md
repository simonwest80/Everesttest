# User-Defined Payroll Items


**Everest US Payroll** allows you to define new payroll items as per your requirements. Unlike default payroll items, the user-defined items are applicable only to the specific employee for whom the payroll item has been defined. Bonus, special allowances etc., are examples of user-defined payroll items.
