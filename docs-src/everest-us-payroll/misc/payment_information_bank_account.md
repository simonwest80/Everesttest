# Payment Information - Bank Account


Use this section of the wizard to specify the bank account for making  payments.


**Bank Code**
: Specify the bank account for making payments in  this field. When you select the bank code, the name of the bank is also  displayed in the field adjacent to the **Bank 
 Code**. This is a mandatory field.


**Posted Balance**
: This field displays the posted balance of the bank  specified by you in the **Bank Code**  field. You cannot modify this field. This balance does not include the  value of transactions created in journals that have not been posted.


**Bank Currency**
: The bank currency is displayed by default, when  you specify the bank account. The bank currency could be different from  your payroll currency. You cannot modify this field. Bank currency specified  in the **Currency Code** field of  the **Chart of Accounts** profile  (path: **Accounting &gt; Chart of Accounts**  > double-click on the required account > **Multi-currency**  tab) is populated in this field.


**Exchange Rate to Base**
: This field denotes the exchange rate for translating  the bank currency into your base currency. By default, the value in this  field will be one. You can change it as per the requirements.


**Payment Currency**
: This field denotes the currency in which you are  making the payment. The currency that you specified in the **Payroll 
 Company Setup** dialog box (path: **Payroll 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Company**) is populated in this field. You can, however,  modify this field and select a currency other than USD as the payment  currency.


**Exchange Rate to Base**
: This field denotes the exchange rate for translating  the payment currency into your base currency. By default, the value in  this field will be one. If you specify a currency other than USD in the  **Payment Currency** field, this field  is also enabled and allows you to enter the exchange rate accordingly.


Click **Next** to resume. You will  see the [**Payment
