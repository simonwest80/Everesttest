# Pay Type and Pay Period


This section includes details of pay period, transaction type, date  range and the date of transaction.


The pay type - **Regular** or **Supplemental** - that you specified in  the **Payroll Transaction Processing**  section of the wizard is displayed beside the **Pay 
 Period** field.


**Pay Period**


This field denotes the period for which an employee is paid. The pay  period specified in the **Payroll Transaction****Processing** section of the wizard **** is displayed by default.


**Pay Date**


This field denotes the payday for the transactions.


{:.note}
The pay date should not be less than the end  date of the payroll period.


**Start Date/End Date**
: These fields denote the date range for which the  employee is being paid. **Everest** automatically calculates the date range **** based on the payroll period selected. You cannot modify these fields.


**Pay Period Regular Hours**
: This is used to prorate salary when the employee's  release date or joining date is in between the payroll period for which  transaction is created. In this case, the number of hours worked is divided  by the number of regular hours in that pay period and multiplied by the  salary for that pay period to get the prorated salary.


{:.note}
For supplemental payroll processing, **Pay Period Regular Hours** field is not  applicable and hence does not appear in the user interface. And in case  the filing state is **California**,  a new field **Calculation Type** is  introduced. This field has two options - **Bonus**  and **Commission** - based on which  the supplement payroll is calculated.


The **Calculation 
 Type** field is displayed only if the employees' filing state is  CALIFORNIA.
