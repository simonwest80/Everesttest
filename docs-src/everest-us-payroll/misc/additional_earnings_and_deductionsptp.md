# Additional Earnings and Deductions


All payroll items set up for the employee that are not part of standard  earnings are displayed in the **Additional 
 earnings and deductions** grid.


**Base**
: If the payroll item is calculated as a percentage  or by multiplying a number of units by rate, then this field is enabled.  You are required to specify the base amount (if calculated as a percentage)  or the number of units (if calculated on a rate basis). This option is  disabled, if the payroll item is not calculated as a percentage or on  a rate basis.
