title: Deductions

If the Employee profile specifies a payroll item of the type “**Deductions**”, **Everest 
 US Payroll** automatically calculates and displays the total in this  field. You cannot modify this field if it is automatically calculated.  If necessary, you can change this amount in the Additional Earnings and  Deductions section. If the Employee profile does not specify deductions,  you can enter the deduction amount in this field.
