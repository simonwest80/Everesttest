: Multiply line 7 by .054 and enter the result on  line 9.
: If you were not required to pay state unemployment  tax because all of the wages you paid were excluded from state unemployment  tax, you must pay FUTA tax at the 6.2% (.062) rate. For example, if your  state unemployment tax law excludes wages paid to corporate officers or  employees in specific occupations, and the only wages you paid were to  corporate officers or employees in those specific occupations, you must  pay FUTA tax on those wages at the full FUTA rate of 6.2% (.062). When  you figured the FUTA tax before adjustments on line 8, it was based on  the maximum allowable credit (5.4%) for state unemployment tax payments.  Because you did not pay state unemployment tax, you do not have a credit  and must figure this adjustment.
: **If line 9 applies 
 to you, lines 10 and 11 do not apply to you**. Therefore, leave lines  10 and 11 blank. Do not fill out the worksheet in the instructions or  Part 2, **Schedule A** (Form 940).
