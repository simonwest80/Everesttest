You can sort the transaction records to be listed as per your requirements.  The filter options are common to **Payroll 
 Transaction List**, **Payroll Journal** and **Void Payroll Journal**  dialog boxes.


**Description**
: This field identifies the type of journal. By default,  ' Payroll journal' is displayed here. You can also enter an appropriate  description, e.g., â€˜Salaries for January 2002'. This is a mandatory field.


**Journal Group**
: The journal group identifies the group to which  the journal belongs. Specify the journal group. This field defaults to  the journal group specified in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab > **Journal Group** field)  of the user creating the entry.

: If your base currency is the same as the payroll  currency, the value in the field will be '1' and it cannot be modified.


**Dates**
: Specify the filter option based on which the transaction  records have to be sorted. By default, the filter option **All**  is displayed.
