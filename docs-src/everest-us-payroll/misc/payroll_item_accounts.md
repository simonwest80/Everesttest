# Payroll Item Accounts


US Payroll allows you to allocate payroll amounts to different accounts  at the employee level. Further, payroll amounts may be allocated to different  locations/sub-locations for each employee. This ensures that the payroll  amounts are allocated to appropriate cost centers or profit centers.


If the payroll item account is blank, the default expense or liability  account specified for the payroll item would be used. If an account is  selected and the location/sub-location is left blank, the account is not  allocated to any location/sub-location.


**Debit Account Code**
: This is the account to which the payroll item is  debited. If the payroll item is a third party payment or company-paid  expense or deduction, this field is disabled.


**Location/Sub-Location**
: Location/Sub-location is the location/sub-location  to which the payroll amount is allocated.
: If the account field is blank and the location/sub-location  is assigned for the item, the company's default expense or liability account  for the item is used and the amount is allocated to the selected location/sub-location.
: If the account is selected and the location/sub-location  is blank, the amount is debited to the selected account and allocated  to the location/sub-location assigned in the **Payroll 
 Items** dialog box (path: **Payroll 
 &gt; Payroll Items &gt;** from the **Payroll 
 Items** browser, double-click the required record).


**Credit Account Code**
: This is the account to which the payroll item is  credited.


**Vendor Code**
: **Vendor Code**  identifies the vendor to whom the amount must be paid.
: If the **Credit Account 
 Code** field is blank and the **Vendor 
 Code** is assigned for the item, the company's default expense or  liability account for the item is used and the amount is credited to the  selected vendor.
: If the **Credit Account 
 Code** field is selected and the **Vendor 
 Code** is blank, the amount is credited to the selected account and  to the vendor assigned in the **Payroll 
 Item** dialog box (path: **Payroll 
 &gt; Payroll Items &gt;** from the **Payroll 
 Items** browser, double-click the required record).
: The **Credit Account 
 Code** field is disabled for payroll items of type additions.
