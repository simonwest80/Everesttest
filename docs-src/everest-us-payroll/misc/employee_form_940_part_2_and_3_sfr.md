# Form 940 - Part 2 & 3


PART 2: Determine your FUTA tax before adjustments  for 2007.


Adjustments referred here are the IRS specified adjustments for allowing  credit based on liability for SUTA payments. If any line in Part 2 does  not apply, leave it blank.


**3. Total payment to all employees during calendar  year**
: The total amount payable to the employees, before  any deductions, is displayed in the **Calculated 
 by Everest** field. This amount includes all forms of salary, irrespective  of whether the payroll item is taxable to FUTA or not.
: Make adjustments in the **Adjustments 
 (if any)** field. The **Adjustments 
 (if any)** field refers to manual adjustments made by users in **Everest**. If you enter the adjustment  amount in this field, the amount will be calculated automatically by **Everest**. US Payroll adds or subtracts  the adjusted amount to the amount displayed in the **Calculated 
 by Everest** field and displays the net value in the **Final 
 Amounts** field.

**4. Payment exempt from FUTA tax**
: **You only report 
 an amount as exempt from FUTA on line 4 if you included the amount on 
 line 3.** If you enter an amount on line 4, check the appropriate  box or boxes on lines 4a through 4e to show the types of exempt payments  you made.

: Make any adjustments in the **Adjustments 
 (if any)** field. US Payroll adds or subtracts the adjusted amount  to the amount displayed in the **Calculated 
 by Everest** field and displays the net value in the **Final 
 Amounts** field.


**5. Payments for services of more than $7,000  for services. Enter only amounts over the first $7,000 paid to each employee.  Do not include any exempt payments. The $7,000 amount is the federal wage  base. Your state wage may be different.**
: Only the first $7,000 you paid to each employee  in a calendar year is subject to FUTA tax. This $7,000 is called the FUTA  wage base. Enter on line 5 the total of the amount over $7,000 you paid  to each employee during 2007 after subtracting any exempt payments shown  on line 4.


{:.example}
: You had 3 employees. You paid $44,000 to Employee  A, $8,000 to Employee B, and $16,000 to Employee C, including a total  of $4,500 in payments exempt from FUTA tax for all 3 employees. (To determine  the total payments made to each employee in excess of the FUTA wage base,  the payments exempt from FUTA tax and the FUTA wage base must be subtracted  from total payments. These amounts are shown in parentheses.)


| : Employees | : A | : B | : C |
| : Total payments to employees | : $44,000 | : $8,000 | : $16,000 |
| : Payments exempt from FUTA tax | : $2,000 | : $500 | : $2,000 |
| : FUTA wage base | : (7,000) | : (7,000) | : (7,000) |
|  | : $35,000 | : $500 | : $7,000 |
| : $35,000 + $500 + $7,000 = **$42,500** | : Total of payments made to each employee in excess  of $7,000. You would enter this amount on line 5. |

: If you are a successor employer
: When you figure the payments made to each employee  in excess of $7,000, you may include the payments that the predecessor  made to the employees who continue to work for you only if the predecessor  was an employer for FUTA tax purposes and therefore, was required to file  Form 940.


{:.example}
: During the calendar year, the predecessor employer  paid $5,000 to Employee A. You acquired the predecessor's business. After  the acquisition, you employed Employee A and paid Employee A an additional  $3,000 in wages. None of the amounts paid to Employee A were payments  exempt from FUTA tax.

| **$5,000** | Wages paid by predecessor employer |
| **+3,000** | Wages paid by you |
| ****$8,000**** | **Total payments to Employee A. You would include  this amount on line 3.** |
|  |
| **$8,000** | Total payments to Employee A |
| **- 7,000** | FUTA wage base |
| **$1,000** | **Payments made to Employee A in excess of  $7,000.** |
|  |
| **$1,000** | Payments made to Employee A in excess of $7,000. |
| **+ 5,000** | Taxable FUTA wages paid by predecessor employer |
| **$6,000** | **You would include this amount on line 5.** |


**Calculated by Everest**
: This field displays the amount computed by **Everest**.


**Adjustments (if any)**
: Enter the amount for adjustment in this field. You  can enter positive or negative amounts.


**Final Amounts**
: This field displays the net value by adding the  adjusted amount to the amount calculated by **Everest**.


**6. Total Exempt payments (line 4+line5)**
: To figure your total exempt payments, add the amounts  on lines 4 and 5 and enter the result on line 6.


**7. Â Total  Taxable FUTA wages (line 3-line 6=line 7)**
: To figure your total taxable FUTA wages, subtract  line 6 from line 3 and enter the result on line 7.


**8. FUTA tax before adjustments (line 7x 0.008=line  8)**
: To figure your total FUTA tax before IRS specified  adjustments for allowing credit on account of paying SUTA , multiply line  7 by .008 and enter the result on line 8.


PART 3: Determine your adjustments.
: If any line in Part 3 does not apply, leave it blank.


**9. If ALL of the taxable FUTA wages you paid  were excluded from state unemployment tax, multiply line 7 by 0.054 (line  7 x 0.054=line 9).**
: Multiply line 7 by .054 and enter the result on  line 9.
: If you were not required to pay unemployment tax  because all the wages you paid were excluded from state unemployment tax,  you must pay FUTA tax at the 6.2% (.062) rate. For example, if your state  unemployment tax law excludes wages paid to corporate officers or employees  in specific occupations, and the only wages you paid were to corporate  officers or employees in those specific occupations, you must pay FUTA  tax on those wages at the full FUTA rate of 6.2% (.062). When you figured  the FUTA tax before adjustments on line 8, it was based on the maximum  allowable credit (5.4%) for state unemployment tax payments. Because you  did not pay state unemployment tax, you do not have a credit and must  figure this adjustment.
: **If line 9 applies 
 to you, lines 10 and 11 do not apply to you**. Therefore, leave lines  10 and 11 blank. Do not fill out the worksheet in the instructions or  Part 2, Schedule A (Form 940).


{:.note}
**Line 11 and Part 2 of Schedule A (Form 940)  were shaded out for 2006 and 2007 because there are no credit reduction  states for these years.**


**10. If SOME of the taxable FUTA wages you paid  were excluded from state unemployment tax, OR you paid ANY state unemployment  tax late, fill out the worksheet.**
: The worksheet takes you step by step through the  process of figuring your credit.


{:.note}
**Do not complete the worksheet if line 9 applied  to you.**

**11. If credit reduction applied,**
: The U.S. Department of Labor has announced that  there are no credit reduction states for tax year 2007. Therefore, do  not complete lines 2 and 11. A state that has not repaid money it borrowed  from the federal government to pay unemployment benefits is called a credit  reduction state. The U.S. Department of Labor determines which states  are credit reduction states.
: If you paid wages that are subject to the unemployment  tax laws of a credit reduction state, you may have to pay more FUTA tax  when filing your Form 940.


{:.note}
**Line 11 was shaded out for 2007 because there  are no credit reduction states for 2007. For more information, see [http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i940/](http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i940/)**
