---


SITA is rounded off in some US states and in some it is not. In states  where it is rounded off, specify how you want the rounding to be done,  by selecting one of the following options from the drop-down list.

- **Round 
 based on state policy** - If you select this option, then SITA will  be rounded off as per the rounding policy suggested for that state.
- **Round 
 to the nearest dollar** - If you select this option, then SITA will  be rounded off to the nearest dollar, cutting off the decimal part.



{:.example}
If the SITA is 35.75 USD, it will be rounded  off to 36 USD upon choosing the above option.

- **Do 
 not round** - If you select this option, tax will not be rounded  off and the decimal part is retained as it is.
