title: zzannual limit field
---


Select this check box for which the annual limit needs to be set. Enter  the value in the field beside for the annual limit. This check box is  enabled only if the options **Deductions**  or **Company Contribution** is selected  in the **Type** field.


{:.example}
If there are two payroll items ‘Company contribution  to 401K’ and ‘Employee Insurance deduction’  then you may decide to set the limit only for ‘Company contribution to  401K’ and so select the **Annual Limit** check box, but leave it unchecked for the ‘Employee Insurance deduction’.  Where no amount is entered in this field, it would mean that there is  no limit for the particular payroll item.
