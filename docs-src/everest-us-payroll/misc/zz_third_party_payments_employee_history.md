title: Third Party Payments
---


If the Employee profile specifies a payroll item of the type “**Additions**” and pay type “**Third 
 Party** **Payment**”, **Everest 
 US Payroll** automatically calculates and displays the total in this  field. You cannot modify this field if it is automatically calculated.  If necessary, you can change this amount in the Additional Earnings and  Deductions section. If the Employee profile does not specify third party  payments, you can enter the amount of the third party payments in this  field.
