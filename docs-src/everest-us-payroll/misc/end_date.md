These fields denote the date range for which the employee is being paid.  **Everest** automatically calculates  the date range based on the payroll period selected.


{:.example}
Assume that the payroll period selected is  ‘Monthly’ and you enter 01/07/00 in the **Date 
 From** field. Then **Everest**  automatically calculates the end date by adding 30 days to the date entered  in the **Date** **From**  field.
