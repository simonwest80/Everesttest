If you reported $50,000 or less in taxes during the lookback period,  you are a monthly schedule depositor unless the $100,000 Next-Day Deposit  Rule discussed in section 11 of Pub. 15 (Circular E) applies.


You are a monthly schedule depositor for the calendar year if the taxes  reported on Form 941 for the lookback period are $50,000 or less.


![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) The lookback  period constitutes the four consecutive quarters ending on June 30 of  the prior year. For 2007, the lookback period begins July 1, 2005, and  ends June 30, 2006. For details on the deposit rules, see section 11 of  Pub. 15 (Circular  E).

# Form 941 - Part 2 & Part 4


Part 2: Deposit schedule for this quarter


This part of the form indicates if the employer is a monthly or semi-weekly  schedule depositor for that quarter.


**14. State Abbreviation**
: In the spaces provided, write the two-digit Postal  Service abbreviation for the state where you deposit your taxes using  Form 8109 or initiate EFTPS transfers. If you deposit in multiple states,  enter "MU" in the spaces provided.


**15. Check One:**

- Line 10 is  less than $2500; [Go  to Part 3]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/the_employee_form_941_address_sfr.html#part3_details_form_941)

{:.note}
: The total tax liability is calculated as  the sum of the tax liability for the three months that comprise the quarter.  The tax liability in each month is the sum of all the payroll items checked  for FITA, social security and Medicare after reducing the amount of advance  EIC and grouped on a monthly basis (for the months in that quarter).
: If the total tax liability for the quarter  is not equal to the total taxes shown on line 10, **Everest** notifies you of the same and asks if you would like the difference  to be adjusted in line 7a, that is, the **Current 
 quarter’s fraction of cents** field.
: Now you can proceed to [Part  3]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/the_employee_form_941_address_sfr.html#part3_details_form_941).

If you are a semiweekly schedule depositor, your tax liability in each  month is the sum of all the payroll items checked for FITA, social security  and Medicare after reducing the amount of advance EIC and grouped on a  daily basis (for the months in that quarter).


| ![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) | **On February 6, 2007, Pine Co. discovered that  it had over reported the social security tax on a prior quarter return  by $2,500. Its Form 941 taxes for the first quarter of 2007 were as shown  below:**<br/><br/><br/>| January | $2000 |<br/>| February | $2000 |<br/>| March | $2000 |<br/><br/><br/><br/>**Pine Co. adjusts liabilities on line 15 as  follows to offset the over reported amount of $2500:**<br/><br/><br/>| Month 1 | $2000 |<br/>| Month 2 | $0.00 |<br/>| Month 3 | $1500 |<br/>| Total | $3500 |<br/><br/><br/><br/>**Since the error was not discovered until February,  it does not affect the liabilities reported in the month of January, that  is, Month 1 of line 15. For the month of  February,  the entire amount of $2000 is used to offset the over reported tax liability;  thus, Month 2 of line 15 displays zero. The balance amount of $500 is  adjusted against tax for the month of March; hence, $1500 makes up the  amount for Month 3 on line 15.**<br/><br/><br/>**Using the above example, if the over reported  social security tax on a prior quarter return was $10,000, Pine Co. could  carry the excess negative adjustment of $6,000 ($10,000 - $2,000 - $2,000)  to the next quarter. Pine Co. would only report $4,000 of the adjustment  on line 7e because line 10 must equal the total shown in line 15. See  Form 941c for reporting requirements and information on the option of  filing a claim for refund of overpaid employment taxes.** |
