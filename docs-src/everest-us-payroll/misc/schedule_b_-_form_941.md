# Schedule B - Form 941


Schedule B (Form 941) is used to report the tax liability of an employer  on a daily basis.


Tax Liability = Income tax withheld + Social Security (employee and  employer) + Medicare Taxes (employee and employer) - Advance earned income  credit payments


**Monthly Depositors**: You are  a federal monthly depositor if your company's federal tax liability during  the lookback  period was less than $50,000. This is why all new employers are monthly  depositors. Monthly depositors pay taxes for a given month by the 15th  of the next month.


{:.example}
Taxes for the month of June are due by July  15th. However, if the 15th falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the due  date is deferred to the next banking day.


**Semiweekly Depositors**: If your  lookback liability  is greater than $50,000, you are a semi-weekly depositor. You pay taxes  on three banking days after the end of any semi-weekly period in which  you accrued a liability. The IRS divides the week into two periods: (1)  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and (2) Saturday, Sunday, Monday and  Tuesday. Taxes accrued during the Wednesday-Friday period are due on the  following Wednesday, and taxes accrued during the Saturday-Tuesday period  are due on the following Friday. In some cases, when a bank holiday occurs  during the week, you are granted an extra day to make the tax payment.


Exceptions to the Deposit Schedule Rules


There are two main exceptions to the monthly and semi-weekly tax deposit  requirements:

- **Next-Day 
 Deposit Rule**: If you accrue $100,000 or more in federal tax liability  at any point during a deposit period, you must remit taxes on the next  banking day. This could result from a single payroll, or it could result  from multiple payrolls within a single deposit period (month or semi-week).



{:.example}
If you are a monthly depositor and pay a one-time  bonus to employees that results in more than $100,000 in liability on  a single day, you must pay the amount due immediately. You also become  a semiweekly depositor until your lookback  liability falls below the $50,000 threshold again.

- **Quarterly 
 Exemption**: If your federal tax liability is less than $2,500 for  a quarter, regardless of your deposit schedule, there is an option of  paying taxes due with your tax filing at the end of the quarter, instead  of making deposits during the quarter.



{:.note}
Schedule B must also be used by semiweekly  schedule depositors who file Form 941-SS, Employer's Quarterly Federal  Tax Return (for American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands,  and the U.S. Virgin Islands).
