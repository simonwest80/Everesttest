# Vacation and Other Accruals


**Vacation Accrual** - An employee is eligible to avail vacation leave for a particular number of hours for every pay period that the employee works.

The employee may utilize the vacation hours at a future date but the vacation hours are earned in the current pay period. The vacation pay paid to the employee when they were utilized is an expense that belongs to the period in which they were earned and not the period in which they were utilized.
