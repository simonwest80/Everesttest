# Purge a Payment


{:.steps}
To purge a payment, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting** >  **US Payroll** > **Payments**  > **Reverse Payment**. You will  see the **Reverse Payments** browser  listing all the payment journals created in Everest.
- Highlight the  record you want to purge and select **Options**  > **Purge**.



{:.note}
- Purging removes  the transaction from the **Reverse Payment**  browser and relocates it to **Void Payroll 
 Journal** dialog box.
- You can select  the **Reverse Payment** option only  when the payment has a check number assigned.
- If you select multiple  transactions to be purged, only zero amount payment transactions and those  transactions that do not have a check number assigned and printed will  purge.
