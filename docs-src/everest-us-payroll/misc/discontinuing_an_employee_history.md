# Discontinue an Employee History


When you discontinue a particular employee history, it is temporarily  unavailable for selection. The record is not deleted from the database,  it is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available  for selection by activating it again.

{:.steps}
To discontinue an employee history, do the  following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Payroll &gt; Employees**  > **Employee History**. You will  see the **Employee History** browser.
- Highlight the  record you want to discontinue.
- From the **Employee History** browser, select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will see  the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK** to discontinue the specific information.



{:.note}
If you discontinue a historical transaction,  subsequent payroll transactions that would have calculated taxes on the  year to date amounts including the historical amounts, would now be wrong.  **Everest** displays a warning if  you discontinue a historical transaction of an employee who has payroll  transactions that are processed after the historical pay date, in the  same calendar year.


You can choose whether or not to discontinue  this transaction by clicking **Yes**  or **No**.


**Everest**  also logs an event if you choose to discontinue such historical transactions.
