# Form 940 - Part 4 & 5


PART 4: Determine your FUTA tax and balance due or  overpayment for 2008.


FUTA rate for 2008


The FUTA tax rate is scheduled to decrease from 6.2%  to 6.0% for 2008. However, legislation is pending that would eliminate  the reduction in the rate. If the legislation is enacted, the rate will  remain at 6.2% for 2008.


The adjustments referred here are the IRS specified adjustments for  allowing credit on account of paying SUTA. If any line in Part 4 does  not apply, leave it blank.


**12. Total FUTA tax after adjustments**
: **Everest**  displays the sum of the amounts shown on lines 8, 9, and 10.


{:.warn}
If  line 9 is greater than zero, lines 10 and 11 must be zero because they  would not apply.


{:.note}
- If you are not  liable to pay SUTA in any state, then you will not benefit from the additional  credit and end up paying FUTA at 6.2%. This line would show the sum of  tax due on Line 8 (at 0.008) + tax due on line 9 (at 0.054).
- If you pay SUTA  in one or more state, then you fill out the worksheet and then this line  would display the sum of line 8 and line 10 (Line 11 will not apply for  year 2006 and Line 9 will not apply if Line 10 applies to you).


**13. FUTA tax deposited for the year, including  any payment applied from a prior year**
: Enter the amount of total FUTA tax that you deposited  for the year, including any overpayment that you applied from a prior  year.


**14. Balance due**
: If line 13 is less than line 12, **Everest**  displays the difference on line 14.
: If line 14 is:

- More than $500,  you must deposit your tax.
- $500 or less,  you can deposit your tax, pay your tax with a major credit card, or pay  your tax by check or money order with your return.
- Less than $1,  you do not have to pay it.



{:.warn}
If you do not deposit as required and pay  your tax with Form 940, you may be subject to a penalty.

**15. Overpayment**
: If line 13 is more than line 12, the system displays  the difference on line 15.
: If you deposited more than the FUTA tax due for  the year, you may choose to have us either:

- Apply the refund  to your next return, or
- Send you a  refund.

: Also, check the appropriate box in line 15 to tell  which option you select. If you do not check either box, you will automatically  receive your overpayment. Also, the overpayment may be applied to any  past due tax account you have.
: If line 15 is less than $1, you will receive the  refund or it may be applied to your next return only if you ask for it  in writing.


PART 5: Report Your FUTA Tax Liability by Quarter  Only if Line 12 Is More Than $500.00. If not go to PART 6 in General Tab
: Fill out Part 5 only if line 12 is more than $500.  If line 12 is $500 or less, leave Part 5 blank and go to Part 6.


**16. Report the amount of your FUTA tax liability  for each quarter**
: The system automatically displays the FUTA tax liability  for each quarter on lines 16a-d. You may however make any adjustments  if necessary. Do not enter the amount you deposited. If you had no liability  for a quarter, leave the line blank.

| **16a**. 1rst quarter (January 1  to March 31). |
| **16b**. 2nd quarter (April 1 to  June 30). |
| **16c**. 3rd quarter (July 1 to  September 30). |
| **16d**. 4th quarter (October 1  to December 31). |
: To figure your FUTA tax liability for the fourth  quarter, complete Form 940 through line 12. Then copy the amount from  line 12 onto line 17. Lastly, subtract the sum of lines 16a through 16c  from line 17 and enter the result on line 16d.


{:.example}
: You paid wages on March 28 and your FUTA tax on  those wages was $200. You were not required to make a deposit for the  1st quarter because your accumulated FUTA tax was $500 or less. You paid  additional wages on June 28 and your FUTA tax on those wages was $400.  Because your accumulated FUTA tax for the 1st and 2nd quarters exceeded  $500, you were required to make a deposit of $600 by July 31.
: You would enter $200 in line 16a because your liability  for the 1 st quarter is $200. You would also enter $400 in line 16b to  show your 2 nd quarter liability.


**17. Total tax liability for the year**
: The system displays the sum of the amounts entered  in the lines 16a, 16b, 16c and 16d on the line 17. If the amount entered  in line 17 of Form 940 does not match with the amount on line 12 of Form  940, you will see the Error message displayed with the difference amount.


**Enter the amount of payment you are making**
: Enter the amount of payment against your FUTA tax  liability.
