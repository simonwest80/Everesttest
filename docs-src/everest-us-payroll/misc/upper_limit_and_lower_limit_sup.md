# Upper Limit and Lower Limit


**Upper Limit**
: Upper limit is the annual gross or net salary of  the employee beyond which the local tax need not be deducted. Local tax  is deductible until the annual gross pay or net pay reaches this limit.
: <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">Upper limit will be the annual 
 gross pay, if you have specified the calculation type as </font>**% of Gross**. It will be the annual net  pay, if you have specified the calculation type as **% 
 of Net Pay**
: ![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) <font face="verdana" class="hcp3">If the upper limit 
 specified is $7000, then the local tax is not deducted when the annual 
 gross or net pay of the employee exceeds $7000.</font>


**Lower Limit**
: Lower limit is the annual gross or net pay of the  employee up to which the local tax need not be deducted. Local tax is  deductible when the annual gross pay or net pay crosses this amount.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) **** If the lower limit specified is $2000,  then the deduction for the local tax starts when the annual gross or net  pay of the employee exceeds $2000.


**Amount/Percentage**
: The amount is the actual amount of the local tax  payable by the employee and employer. This is either the percentage or  rate or the flat amount depending on the calculation type selected. If  you specify the calculation type as **Flat 
 Amount** or **Based on the Hours Worked**,  the **Percentage** field changes to  the **Amount** field. For rest of  the calculation type, the **Percentage**  field is displayed.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) **** If the calculation type is a percentage  of something (**% Gross** or **% Net Pay**); then you have to enter the  percentage in the **Percentage** field.  If it is **Based on the Hours worked**,  then enter the rate in the **Amount** field.


**Everest** will calculate the amount  at the time of payroll processing based on the tax rates specified in  the **Local Tax** dialog box.
