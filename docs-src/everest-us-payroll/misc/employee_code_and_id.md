# Employee Code and ID


**Employee Code**
: This is the code of the user who is to be set up  as an employee.
: **Everest**  requires that all employees are initially set up as users for the following  reasons:

- The user's  address and contact information need not be replicated in the setup.
- The user's  Social Security Number is used in the Form W2 for the employee.
- **Everest**  encompasses all areas of your company's operations and most employees  are likely to be set up as users of **Everest**.  Information specific to users such as custom fields, multimedia information  need not be recreated in the **Employee**  setup.



**Employee ID No**
: This is the identification number given to that  employee by your company's Human Resource department. This helps you correctly  identify the employee. All users who are not set up as employees are available  for selection.


**Vendor for Take-home Pay**
: For all practical purposes, an employee is a vendor  of services to your company. US Payroll credits the take home pay of the  employee to a vendor account. You must therefore set up a vendor for each  employee to credit take home pay.
