# Transactions Grid


This grid displays the transaction records of the employees belonging to the payroll period specified in the **Select Payroll Transactions** dialog box. This grid lists details of transaction records such as whether the record is of a regular or supplemental transaction, whether a payroll journal is created for the transaction.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)<font face='verdana'>  </font>If a payroll journal is created for the transaction, then the **Payroll Journal** check box will be selected in the grid.


If you want to view details of a specific transaction, highlight the record. Details of the transaction will be displayed in the **Earnings and Deductions**, **Additional earnings and Deductions** and **Taxes** tabs.
