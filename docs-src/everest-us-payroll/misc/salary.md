# Salary 


The salary of the employee is calculated by dividing the yearly salary specified in the **Employee** profile by the number of pay periods in the year.


**![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  In the **Employee** profile, the yearly salary of an employee is specified as $75,000 and the pay period is monthly. Therefore the employee's salary for a pay period is 75,000 / 12 = 6250.**
