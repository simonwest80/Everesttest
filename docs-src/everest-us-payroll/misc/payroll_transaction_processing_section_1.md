# The Payroll Transaction Processing Section â€“ Select Employees


This section lists the employees for whom you need to process payroll  transactions. Details of the employees include employee code, first name  and last name. These details are derived from the **Employee** profile (path: **Payroll &gt; Employees 
 &gt; Employee Data** > from the **Employees**  browser, double-click the required record).


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you create a regular payroll transaction for an employee for the period  April 1, 2001 - April 15, 2001, you cannot create a new regular transaction  for the same employee for the period April 15, 2001 - April 30, 2001.  However, you can create a supplemental transaction, if no other supplemental  transaction exists for the same period.

When you click **Finish**  in the next section of the wizard, **Everest**  warns you if the following conditions are met:

- A payroll transaction  with a pay date subsequent to the current one exists
- If the pay date  of the subsequent transaction is in the same calendar year
- If the payroll  transaction is for the selected employee


You can choose whether or not to create this transaction by clicking  **Yes** or **No**.


**Everest** also logs an event if  you choose to create such payroll transactions.
