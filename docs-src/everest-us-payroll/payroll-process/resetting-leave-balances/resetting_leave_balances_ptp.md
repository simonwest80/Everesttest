# Resetting Leave Balances


You can reset the vacation and sick leave balances of the employees  to zero at the beginning of every calendar year, if you do not want to  carry over them.


Only the leave balances of the employees for whom you have selected  the options **Reset sick every year**  and **Reset vacation every year**  in the **General** tab of the **Employee** profile (path: **Payroll 
 &gt; Employees &gt; Employee Data** > from the **Employees**  browser, double-click the required record) are set to zero.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the option **Reset sick every year**  is not selected for an employee in the **Employee**  profile, the sick leave balance of that employee will not be set to zero,  when you reset the leave balance.

- From the main  menu bar, select **Payroll &gt; Reset Leave 
 Balance**. You will see the **Confirmation**  window.
