# Payroll Payments Browser


The **Payroll Payments** browser  displays all the transaction records selected for payment. This browser  allows you to generate a computer check for the selected transactions.  You can also make a manual payment from this browser. You can access this  browser by clicking **Finish** in  the **Employee Information** section  of the **Payroll Payment Wizard**.


This browser also displays the **Payment 
 Type** (payment method), **Bank Code**  and the date range that you specified in the **Payroll 
 Payment Wizard**.


**Transactions Grid**
: Transaction grid in this browser displays details  of each transaction such as transaction number, pay date, take home pay  etc. Amount of payment is the take home pay and it cannot be edited.
: If you want to generate a computer check, select  the option **Computer Check**. Leave  this option unchecked to make a manual payment, where check is written  out by hand or a wire transfer etc.
: If you are making a manual payment, you need to  enter the reference number for payment in the **Check 
 #** column. For a manual payment, you can also specify the check  date in the **Check Date** column.  The **Check #** and **Check 
 Date** columns are disabled, if you have opted for a computer generated  check.


**Zero Dollar Transactions**
: Employees with a take home pay of  $0.00  are also listed in this browser.
: ![]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/hint.gif)  You  can create payroll payment journals even when an employee’s take home  pay is nil in order to record the payroll transaction and generate statutory  forms and pay stubs.
: For such transactions, you cannot print computer  checks. You must enter the check number and date in the **Reference 
 #** and **Reference Date** fields.  When you select this transaction for payment, accounting entries are not  created for the same. However, the transaction is marked as paid in the  back end.
