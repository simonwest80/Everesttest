# Reverse Payments Browser


The **Reverse Payments** browser  (path: **Accounting** > **US 
 Payroll** > **Payments** >  **Reverse Payment**) lists all original  payment payroll transactions for which a payment journal has been created.  When you reverse a transaction in this browser, **Everest**  reverses it but you will not be able to perform further reversing, purging,  or voiding on this transaction. If you reverse and recreate a transaction  in this browser, **Everest** replaces  the reversed transaction with the new recreated one.


{:.note}
Only those transactions that have check number  assigned and printed can be reversed.


Information in the Reverse Payments browser is grouped into the following  sections:

- [View  Options]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/view_options_reverse_payment_browser.html)
- [Transactions  Grid]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/transactions_grid_reverse_payment_browser.html)
