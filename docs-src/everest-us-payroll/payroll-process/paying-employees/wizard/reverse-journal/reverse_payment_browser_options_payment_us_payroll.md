# Reverse Payment Browser Options


The following options (path: **Reverse 
 Payments** browser > **Options**)  are available in the **Reverse Payments**  browser.


**Select/Unselect/Select All/Unselect All**
: Use these options to select or unselect individual  or all transaction records from the transactions grid.


**Purge**
: Use this option for computerized checks that are  not printed or for zero amount payroll transactions. When you select this  option, the transaction is removed from the **Reverse 
 Payments** browser and moved to **Void 
 Payroll Journal** dialog box. This enables you to create another  payroll transaction for the same period and print the check.

**Reverse Payment**
: Use this option to reverse and recreate a payment  journal that has a check number assigned.  When  you select this option, **Everest**  creates a reversal entry for the original transaction, and an entry to  recreate it. If you have just reverse a payment journal, the reversed  and the reversal entry will no longer appear in this browser. However,  it will appear in the **Void Payment Journal**  dialog box and will create a new journal entry for reversal in **Unposted 
 Payment Journal** browser. If you have reversed and re-created an  entry, only the re-created entry will appear in this browser.  Also,  two new journal entries for the reversal and reversed journal will appear  in **Unposted Payment Journal** browser.  You can choose the transaction dates for both entries as the date of the  original transaction or a different date.


All the other options available in this browser are standard options  common to all browsers in **Everest**.
