Following are the steps in the **Payroll 
 Transaction Processing** wizard:

- Tax details  for taxes applicable, filing state, filing status and exemptions claimed,

 Transactions** profile only if you process payroll transactions using  the option **Process with Preview**.

- Hours of sick  leave
- Hours of vacation  leave
- Regular hours
- Overtime hours
