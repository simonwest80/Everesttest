# Employer Taxes


The **Employer Taxes** tab displays  details of the federal and state taxes paid by the company that are associated  with the employee's earnings in the pay period.


Taxable Amount


This section displays the amount that is taxable to federal, state and  local taxes.


Taxes Deducted


This section displays the federal, state and local tax amounts paid  by the company. You can make changes to the amounts in these fields as  per the requirements.

If you change the regular, overtime, vacation  or sick hours or the amount in the **Additional 
 earnings and deductions** grid, then **Everest 
 US Payroll** recalculates these taxes and you will lose all the changes  made to these taxes.
