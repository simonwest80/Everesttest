# Create a Payroll Journal


You can create a payroll journal from the following location:


The **Payroll Journal** dialog box  - Select **Options &gt; Create Payroll 
 Journal**.


{:.steps}
To create a payroll journal, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Accounting &gt; US Payroll 
 &gt; Payroll Journal &gt; Create Payroll Journal**. You will see  the **Payroll Journal** dialog box.
- From the **Payroll Journal** dialog box, select the  transaction records for which you want to create a payroll journal. Then,  select **Options &gt; Create Payroll Journal**.



{:.note}
The **Payroll 
 Journal** and the **Purchase Receipt**  is created as on the pay date for the transaction. The pay date is displayed  in the **Payroll Journal** browser.  If pay dates of the selected transaction records are different from each  other, new payroll journals are created for each of them. The newly created  payroll journal can be viewed in the **Unposted****Purchase Journals** browser (path: **Accounting &gt; Account Payable &gt; Purchase 
 Journal**).


You cannot create a Payroll Journal for discontinued  vendors. If a vendor (to whom Federal, State or Local taxes are payable)  is discontinued, and the option **Create 
 Payroll Journal** is selected, **Everest**  displays an error message about the same and asks you to try after either  activating the vendor or associating an active vendor with the employee's  payroll accounts.


If the take home pay is zero, accounting entries  are not created.
