# Modify a Supplemental Payroll Transaction


You can modify only those payroll transactions for which payroll journals  have not been created. You can modify all the enabled fields in a **Payroll Transactions** profile.


When you modify a supplemental payroll transaction, the following amounts  are recalculated based on the current details in the **Employee** profile:

- Additional  earnings based on an amount or percentage
- Taxes



The amounts of any of the above are recalculated only if the existing  value in a relevant field is modified.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  commission and bonus are 2 items, and you modify the base for commission,  only commission is recalculated using the current percentage given in  the **Employee** profile.
