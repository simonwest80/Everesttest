# Form 941 (Schedule B) Dialog Box


Click the **Schedule B** button  adjacent to the **Semiweekly Schedule Depositors**  check box (path: **Accounting &gt; US Payroll 
 &gt; Statutory Forms &gt; Form 941 &gt; Lines 16 and 17**) to display  the **Form 941 (Schedule B)** dialog  box.


Schedule B Summary


The **Schedule B Summary** section  depicts the tax liability of each month of the current quarter and of  the quarter immediately preceding it. The quarters must necessarily belong  to the same calendar year. If the current quarter refers to the first  quarter of the year, the **Previous Values**  section is not displayed.


Months 1, 2 and 3 indicate the tax liability for each month of the quarter;  whereas, Month 4 represents the total tax liability of the aforesaid quarter.


{:.note}
The total liability for a quarter in Schedule  B must equal the value in line 10 on Form 941(or Line 8 on Form 941-SS).  In case of a discrepancy, **Everest**  apprises you of the same and asks if you would like to adjust the difference  in Form 941-Line 7a ("Current quarter's fraction of cents" box).


The grid at the bottom of the **Form 
 941 (Schedule B)** dialog box consists of three tabs: **First**,  **Second** and **Third**.  These tabs correspond to the three months that make up the quarter for  which you are reporting the tax liability.


Columns of the Grid


Day


This column displays the days of the month.


Calculated Amount


The tax liability for each date when wages are paid is calculated by  **Everest** and displayed in this  column. You cannot edit this amount.


Adjustments


Enter the amount of under-reported or over-reported tax liability as  adjustments in the **Adjustments**  column. You can enter both positive and negative amounts in this column;  however, the figure should not exceed the amount displayed in the **Calculated Amount** column. Since an over-reported  liability has to be offset only against subsequent liabilities, the credit  adjustment amount cannot be more than the 'Calculated amount'.


{:.note}
Under-reported tax liability must be adjusted  against the date on which the error is discovered.


{:.example}
Tax liability for the quarter April-June 2007  was $15,000. However, the tax reported in Schedule B for that quarter  was only $ 13,000. If you notice this difference of $2000 on December  4th, 2007, report the same in the October-December  quarter of 2007 against the date December 4th.


{:.note}
To rectify an over-reported liability, adjust  the amount as a credit in subsequent liabilities until the amount is exhausted.


{:.example}
You pay wages on every alternate day of the  month: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and so on. On the 3rd of December, you  discover that you have over reported social security tax on a prior quarter  by $12,000. Break up the over-reported amount and adjust it against the  tax liabilities of three pay days: ($5000) on 3rd December, ($5000) on  5th December and ($2000) on 7th December.


Final Amount


The ‘Final Amount’  is calculated as a sum of the columns 'Calculated Amount' and 'Adjustments'.
