# Statutory Forms


**The statutory forms are the reports required  by the Federal Government. The Federal Government specifies the format  of these forms<font face="Verdana" class="hcp2">.</font>**


****Everest 
 US Payroll** provides the following statutory forms<font face="Verdana" class="hcp2">:</font>**

- [Form  W2]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-w2/form_w2_sfr.html) - Annual Wage and Tax Statement
- [Form  W3]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-w3/form_w3_sfr.html) - Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements
- [Form  940]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-940/form_940_sfr.html) - Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment
- [Form  941]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/statutory-forms-and-reports/form-941/form_941_sfr.html) - Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return



{:.note}
For the W2, W3, 940 and 941 statutory forms,  we do not maintain formats specific to each year in **Everest**,  as that would be too cumbersome in terms of maintaining numerous templates  and the respective calculations. If you print a form for any of the previous  years, the data for that year displays in the latest IRS format.
