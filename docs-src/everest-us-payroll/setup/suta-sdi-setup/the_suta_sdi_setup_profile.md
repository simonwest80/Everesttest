# SUTA and SDI Details


Some states collect state unemployment tax (SUTA) and/or state disability  insurance (SDI) from either the employer or employee, or both


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Virginia collects SUTA  from employers. California collects SDI from employees.


State unemployment tax and state disability insurance rates for every  calendar year must be set up for every state in which you pay either SUTA  or SDI. The **SUTA/SDI Setup** dialog  box allows you to define these rates. The tax applicability of a state  is specified in the **State Setup**  profile (path: **Payroll &gt; Setup &gt; 
 State** > from the **State Setup**  browser, double-click the required record).


Some of the states that collect SUTA charge different rates for new  employees.


Contents of the **SUTA/SDI Setup** dialog  box have been grouped into the following sections:

- [Year  and Code]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/suta-sdi-setup/year_and_code.html)
- [SUTA]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/suta-sdi-setup/suta.html)
- [SDI]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/setup/suta-sdi-setup/sdi.html)
