# Employee History


US Payroll does not mandate that you set up information and begin payroll  transactions at the beginning of a calendar year. You may start using  payroll in the middle of a calendar year by setting up the history of  earlier payroll transactions.


If you are setting up **Everest US Payroll**  in the middle of a calendar year, you are required to enter the details  of all payroll transactions that have been paid till date. This process  is known as setting up **Employee History**.  This is necessary for creating statutory forms such as the Forms W2, 940  and 941.


When you set up an employee's history, you may either enter the details  of individual transactions or the consolidated amounts for all previous  transactions.
