# Create an Employee History


If you are setting up **Everest US Payroll**  in the middle of a calendar year, you are required to specify details  of all the payroll transactions that have been paid till date.


You can access the **Employee History**  dialog box from the following locations:

- The **Employee 
 History** browser - Select **Options 
 &gt; New &gt; In New Window**.
- An existing  **Employee History** dialog box -  Select **Options &gt; New**.



{:.steps}
To create an employee history, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Payroll** >  **Employees** > **Employee****History**. You will see the **Employee History** browser.
- From the **Employee History** browser, select **Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window**.  You will see the [**Employee History** dialog box]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/the_employee_history_dialog_box_sup.html).



{:.note}
When you click **Finish**  in the next section of the wizard, **Everest**  warns you if the following conditions are met:

- A payroll transaction  with a pay date subsequent to the current one exists
- If the pay date  of the subsequent transaction is in the same calendar year
- If the payroll  transaction is for the selected employee


You can choose whether or not to create this transaction by clicking  **Yes** or **No**.


**Everest** also logs an event if  you choose to create such historical transactions.
