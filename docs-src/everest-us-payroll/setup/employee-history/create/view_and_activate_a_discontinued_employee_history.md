- Highlight the  record you want to activate.
- From the **Discontinued Employee History** browser,  select **Options &gt; Activate**.  You will see the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK** to activate. The activated record  will be displayed in the **Employee****History** browser.



{:.note}
If you activate a discontinued historical  transaction, subsequent payroll transactions that would have calculated  taxes on the year to date amounts will not include the transaction being  activated now.


**Everest**  displays a warning if you activate a discontinued historical transaction  of an employee who has payroll transactions that are processed after the  historical pay date, in the same calendar year.


You can choose whether or not to activate  this transaction by clicking **Yes**  or **No**.


**Everest**  also logs an event if you choose to re-activate such historical transactions.
