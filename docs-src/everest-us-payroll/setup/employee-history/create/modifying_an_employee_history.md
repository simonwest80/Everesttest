# Modify an Employee History


An employee's history may be modified at any time. However, if you modify  an employee's history after processing payroll for the same calendar year,  then the tax computations for the transactions processed may be erroneous.  You can modify all fields in the **Employee 
 History** except those fields that **Everest 
 US** **Payroll** automatically  calculates.


![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You create historical  transactions until June 2005. The FUTA taxable amount till June is $6500.  When you process payroll for July 2005, Everest computes FUTA for $500  by deducting $6500 from $7000 (the FUTA upper limit for 2005). If you  later modify the historical transaction and the FUTA taxable amount till  June 2005 is $7000, then you would have paid more FUTA than what is required  in July.


You can access the **Employee****History** dialog box you want to  modify from the following locations:

- **Employee 
 History** browser - Highlight the record you want to modify and select  **Edit &gt;** **In 
 New Window**.
- The **Employee 
 History** dialog box - Specify the transaction number of the record  you want to edit.



{:.note}
You can access only the transaction details  of a particular employee by specifying the transaction number in the **Employee History** dialog box.
