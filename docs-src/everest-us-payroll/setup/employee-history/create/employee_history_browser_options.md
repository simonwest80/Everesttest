# Employee History Browser


The **Employee History** browser  (path: **Payroll &gt; Employees &gt; Employee 
 History**) displays all transactions created from the **Employee 
 History** dialog box. Each row is specific to an employee and provides  transaction details of that employee.


Except **Employee Data**, all the  other options (path: **Employee History**  browser > **Options**) available  from this browser are standard options common to all browsers in **Everest**.


Employee Data


This option allows you to access the **Employee**  profile of the selected record.
