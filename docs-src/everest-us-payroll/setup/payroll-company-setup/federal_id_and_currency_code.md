# Federal ID and Currency Code


**Federal ID**
: The federal identification number is the employer  identification number given to you by the Federal Government.


**Currency Code**
: This code identifies the currency in which you are  paying your employees. If your company is headquartered  abroad with a branch in the US, your base currency (in which transactions  are accounted) would be different from the US dollar. Since you pay the  US employees in USD,  the amount must be converted to your base currency for accounting purposes.


{:.note}
The currency code for the US Dollar must be  set up in the **Currency** profile  (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting 
 &gt; Multi-currency &gt; Currency**).
