# State Setup Details


Although the United States has 52 states, your company may be registered  as an employer only in some of the states. **Everest 
 US Payroll** requires you to identify the states where you operate  and the taxes that you pay in each state for the following reasons:

- To ensure that  you identify the payroll tax accounts for each state that you are likely  to pay taxes to.
- To minimize  data entry errors at the time of specifying an employeeâ€™s filing state  and SUTA state in the **Taxes** tab  of the **Employee** profile (path:  **Payroll &gt; Employees &gt; Employee 
 Data** > From the **Employees**  browser, double-click on the required record > **Employee** profile > **Taxes** tab).
- If you are  paying the state unemployment tax, your state identification number must  be reported in the Form 940 - the Federal Unemployment Tax Act return.  The **State Setup** profile allows  you to specify the state ID.



The **State Setup** profile provides  information of the state in which your company is located and the taxes  applicable to that state. Contents of the **State 
 Setup** profile have been grouped into the following sections:
