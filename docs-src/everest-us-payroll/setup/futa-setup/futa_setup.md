# FUTA Setup Details


The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is payable by employers and  calculated on the taxable wages of each employee. You must set up the  FUTA tax rates for each calendar year. The rate that you pay depends on  whether you are eligible for a rebate on FUTA rates for also paying state  unemployment tax (SUTA).


You will have to specify FUTA details in the **FUTA 
 Setup** dialog box.


**Year**
: The year is the calendar year for which you are  setting up the FUTA tax rate.


**Lower Limit Amount**
: FUTA becomes payable for an employee if an employee's  taxable FUTA wages cross the lower limit.
: ![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The lower limit for 2001 is $0 which  means that FUTA is payable on the taxable wages of all employees.


**Upper Limit Amount**
: The upper limit is the maximum taxable wages of  an employee for which FUTA is payable in the calendar year.
: ![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The upper limit for 2001 is $7000,  which means FUTA is calculated and paid on the taxable wages of an employee  until the employee's wages exceed $7001 in the calendar year.


**Percentage**
: The rate of percentage is the rate at which you  pay FUTA and not the federal rate specified. The rate that you pay depends  on whether you are eligible for a rebate for contributions to state unemployment  funds.
: ![example.gif]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The rate for 2002 is 6.2% with a  maximum rebate of 5.4%. If your company qualifies for maximum rebate,  the rate that you set up would be 0.8%.
