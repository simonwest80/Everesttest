# Set up W2 Tracking


The W2 form includes the wages taxable to income tax - medicare and  social security, fringe benefits, dependent care benefits, reported tips  and allocated tips. Your company's wage and compensation structure would  include the payroll items which may have to be specified in one or more  of the boxes in the **Employee Form W2 
 Tracking**. Therefore, you have to set up the W2 tracking for payroll  items.


**Everest US Payroll** processes  the W2 details for each employee based on the tracking specified while  you generate the W2 form report.


{:.steps}
To set up W2 tracking, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Payroll &gt; Setup &gt; 
 W2 Tracking**. You will see the [**Employee Form W2 Tracking**]({{site.prl_baseurl}}/misc/employee_form_w2_tracking.html).
