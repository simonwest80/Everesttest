# Set up a Company


**Everest** is multiple-company  enabled. It can be used to run the operations of more than one company.  The company set up process involves identifying the critical components  of a company's database such as the code that identifies the company,  its location, its chart of accounts, items, customers and vendors.


**Everest** provides you with the  **Company Creation Wizard** to take  you through each step in the set up process. You cannot create a company  database from any other area or menu option.


{:.steps}
To create a company, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; New Company**.  You will see the [**Everest Administrator Login** dialog box]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/the_everest_administrator_login_dialog_box.html).



{:.note}
You must have rights to create a company.

- Enter the details  and click **OK**. You will see the  [Company Creation Wizard]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/the_company_creation_wizard.html).
- Click **Next**. You will see the [Company  Information - Name section]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/company/company_information_name_company_setup.html).
- Enter the details  and click **Create Company**.
- A company is  created with the code and name specified.



{:.note}
The **Company 
 Creation Wizard** is called the **Company 
 Setup Wizard** when it is accessed after the initial company creation.  Once the company has been created, you can also access the **Company 
 Setup Wizard** by selecting **File 
 &gt; Company Wizard** from the main menu bar.
