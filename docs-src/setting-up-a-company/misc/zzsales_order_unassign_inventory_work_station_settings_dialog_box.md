Items committed on a sales order should be detached from it, if the  customer cancels or modifies the order. Specify the stock area/bin where  items once assigned to the sales order must be transferred when they are  detached from the sales order.


{:.example}
**Items detached from sales orders may be moved  back to a stock area called 'Main'.**
