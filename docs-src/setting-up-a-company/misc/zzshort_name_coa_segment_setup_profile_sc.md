If a segment is defined with a length of four  characters, the segment **Short Name**  can be 1-4 characters.

To make your segment template more meaningful,  create Short Names with the same number of characters  as the segment length.


The **Short Name** can be edited  at any time but the number of characters in the Short Name cannot be changed.


{:.example}
A **Short Name**  can be changed from DIV to BRC. It cannot be changed from DIV to BRANCH.
