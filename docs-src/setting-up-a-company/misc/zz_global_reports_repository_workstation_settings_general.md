title: Reports Repository
---


Specify the location of your workstation reports repository. **Everest 
 Reports** reside in, and are accessed from this location.


{:.note}
**• Locations that you enter in this field override  the global reports repository path in the Reporting Preferences (Path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Reporting Preferences** >  **Export Settings** tab).**


**• All repository paths in Everest are stored  in UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths. On a network, the UNC is a  method by which you can identify a shared file in a computer, without  having to specify the storage device it is on. For Windows, the UNC name  format is \\servername\sharename\path\filename.**


**• You can specify the reports repository of  the local workstation, or another server/workstation on your network,  as your workstation reports repository.**
