title: Default stock area for initial items
---


Before you can specify the opening balance of items, you should indicate the stock area that will contain the items. From the drop-down list, select the appropriate stock area. This default stock area will be used unless the stock area is changed for individual items in the **Initial Items Quantity** dialog box.
