# Set up and View Measures


A 'Measure' is used to quantify an item. The price of an item is fixed  per unit of sales measure.


{:.example}
Hour, inch, foot, yard, pint, quart, gallon,  bushel, ounce, pound, short ton, long ton, each, six-pack, case, dozen,  hundred etc.


Measures are used to price items in formats other than a single unit.  The measure to be used for an item is specified when the item is created  in the **Item** profile. **Everest**  can maintain different units of measure for the sale and purchase of an  item.

 and sell it in smaller quantities, say ounces.</font>
