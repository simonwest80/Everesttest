# The Customer Balances Dialog Box


The **Customer Balances** dialog  box lists all the customers who are created in your database.


{:.steps}
To enter the opening balance for a customer, do the following:

- From the **Customer Balances** dialog box, select  the required customer.
- Select the  **Open Documents** from the right-click  menu. You will see the [**Open Documents**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/the_open_documents_dialog_box.html) dialog box.
- Enter the details,  and click **OK**.



{:.note}
When you click **OK**  in the **Open Documents** dialog box,  an accounting entry is automatically created where the 'Accounts Receivable  Control account' is 'debited' and the 'Unreconciled Difference account'  is 'credited' with the value of the receivables. For further details on  account opening balances click [here]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/opening_account_balances.html).

- Continue the  process of entering the opening balances for the customers. Once this  is done, click **OK** to return to  the [**Customer 
 - Account Balances** section]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/customers/customers_account_balances.html) of the **Company 
 Creation Wizard**.



{:.note}
Once the details are saved, you can neither  edit the balances entered, nor can you enter other opening balances.
