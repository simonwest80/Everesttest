title: Apply Tax Rate to Add-On Costs
---


Select this option to include  add-on costs to the item value and then calculate tax on the total amount  during purchases. This setting is applicable for each tax component only  if you have distributed add-on costs and the document’s FOB Type is set  to Destination. Documents set to FOB Origin never include add-on costs  for calculating tax.
