Specify the method for displaying menus and toolbars in **Everest**.

- **Standard 
 -** Select this option to view menu options and toolbars in the standard  Windows view. Infrequently used menus will not be hidden from view when  this option is selected.
- **Enhanced**  - Select this option to display an additional drop-down button beside  the toolbar, using which you can customize the toolbar. Otherwise, the  display will be same as the "standard" display.
- **Flat**  - Select this option to flatten the appearance of toolbars and menu options  (which is three-dimensional in the above two options). When you place  the cursor over the toolbar or the menu options, the display color is  different from the normal view.
