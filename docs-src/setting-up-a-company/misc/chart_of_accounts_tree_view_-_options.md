# Chart of Accounts Tree View - Options


All options available in the **Chart 
 of Accounts** browser are also available in the tree-view of the  Chart of Accounts. Additionally, you can do the following:

- Re-organize  the chart of accounts by dragging and dropping the parent or child accounts  in the required place. Thus, the parent accounts that are defined for  an account can be easily changed.



{:.note}
**You cannot move an account from one financial  category to another; for example, you cannot move an account from category  **Assets** to category **Expenses**.**

- Change the  names of the parent accounts. Highlight the required account in the left  panel and select **Rename** from the  right-click menu or press the **F2**  key. Enter the new account name and press the **Enter**  key to save details.
