# Functions


Functions are the key areas in **Everest**  such as Accounting, Inventory and Invoicing. To sort the security rights  based on functions, click the ![]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/img/sort_by_function.gif) icon<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000"> 
 </font>on the toolbar.


It is useful to sort the security rights based on a particular function,  to assign rights pertaining to a particular function to several users.  The time and effort for assigning rights is thereby considerably reduced.


{:.example}
To assign rights to new users in the sales  department, sort the security rights based on the Invoicing function and  grant the required rights.
