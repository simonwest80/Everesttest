---


Select this check box if you are accessing a report server to generate  reports on your workstation, using a WAN (Wide Area Network) or remote  connection and when your workstation is outside the Local Area Network  of your application server. If this option is selected, the report is  generated at the reports server and sent back to the workstation, one  page at a time.


{:.warn}
You need not select this option if you are not accessing a reports server  for generating reports. There might be formatting differences and limitations  in reports generated when the ‘Low Speed Connection' is selected.


{:.note}
If this option is selected, the **Export** option for **Everest Reports**  will not be available. If this option  is selected, only your default printer will be available for printing.


{:.example}
If you have your main office in the United  States and a subsidiary in Singapore, to run reports in the Singapore  office, you must select the **Low****Speed** **Connection**  check box.


The **Low Speed Connection** check  box is disabled if both the **Everest**  Client and the reports server are on the same Microsoft Windows ® Vista  machine.
