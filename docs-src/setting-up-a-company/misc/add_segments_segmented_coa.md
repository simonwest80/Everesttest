# Add Segments


You can add segments at any time after creating your initial segment  format.


{:.note}
You can only add segments if your existing  account format has not reached the maximum of 40 characters without segment  separators or 45 characters with segment separators.


{:.steps}
To add segments to your existing segment  format, do the following:

- From the main menu bar, select **File**  > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Segments**. You will see the  **COA Segment Setup** profile. Existing  segments display in position order.
- In the **Number 
 of Segments** field, increase the number of segments by the number  of segments to be created. New lines will be added for each new segment  to be created.



{:.example}
If you have three existing segments and you  would like to add one more, change the number of segments from 3 to 4.  A fourth line is added to the list of segments.

- In the **Segment 
 Separator** field, verify the character to be used to distinguish  your segments. Change the segment separator, if necessary.



{:.note}
You can change the Segment Separator from  the **COA Segment Setup** profile  at any time. A segment does not have to be created to do this.

- In the **Length**  field, enter the length of your new segment.
- In the **Short 
 Name** field, enter the **Short Name**  for your new segment. The Short Name cannot be greater than the segment  length.
- In the **Description**  field, enter a description for the new segment.
- Enter information in the **Length**,  **Short Name**, and **Description**  fields for each additional segment you create. The **Current 
 Segment Setup** field updates with your segment format.



{:.note}
Once you create an account, only the segment  length of the last segment can be changed.

- View the **Characters 
 Used** and **Characters Remaining**  fields. Keep this information in mind, especially if you would like to  have room for adding segments to your structure later.
- Use the **Delete**  option to remove a segment from your segment format, if necessary.
- Use the **Move 
 Up** and **Move Down** options  to position your segments correctly in the segment structure.
- When you are satisfied with your segment format,  click the **Save** button to save  your changes.
- If you enter a segment length of more than six  characters, a **Confirmation** dialog  box is displayed. Click **Yes** to  continue to create the segment or click **No**  to return to the segment and adjust the segment length.



After creating your new segment or segments, they must be attached to  accounts.
