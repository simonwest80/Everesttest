# The Location Profile – Accounts – Inventory


In the **Inventory** tab, specify  the accounts to use for the Inventory control accounts. Define these accounts  in both the **Account 1** and **Account 2** tabs. In the **Other 
 Accounts** tab, you can optionally select the posting groups, which  are defined groups of accounts, to use for different categories of items.  This allows you to account for specific item categories based on their  location. The **Other Accounts** tab  is more commonly used by advanced users.


While you do not have to specify accounts for the location being defined,  if you have multiple locations, you may want to define separate accounts  to use for each location for accounting purposes. You can just define  the accounts that are different than the company accounting defaults for  each of your locations.


Accounts defined for an **Item**  profile or **Item Category** will  override accounts specified in the Location profile and accounting defaults.


You can enter accounts in the following sub-tabs:

- [The  Location Profile – Accounts – Inventory – Accounts 1]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/the_location_profile_accounts_inventory_accounts_1_sc.html)
- [The  Location Profile – Accounts – Inventory – Accounts 2]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/the_location_profile_accounts_inventory_accounts_2_sc.html)
- [The  Location Profile – Accounts – Inventory – Other Accounts]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/the_location_profile_accounts_inventory_other_accounts_sc.html)
