# Customers and Vendors


Assigning customers and vendors to locations/sub-locations facilitates  you to obtain aging analysis by location/sub-location. Thus, you can assign  responsibility for Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable and associated  issues such as overdue payments, aging and maintaining the customer and  vendor database.
