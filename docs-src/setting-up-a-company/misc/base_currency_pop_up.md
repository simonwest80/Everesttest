**Base Currency**


The base currency is the currency of the country in which your company  is headquartered  and hence, the currency that you will use for accounting purposes. All  reports and financial statements are in this currency. You can set up  only one currency as the base currency. All foreign currency transactions  have to be accounted for in the base currency (also known as the home  currency or functional currency) by converting the amount in foreign currency  to the base using the relevant exchange rate.
