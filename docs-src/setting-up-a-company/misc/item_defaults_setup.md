# Item Defaults


When you access the **Item** profile  to create an item, certain fields in the profile are automatically populated  based on the defaults that you define. These are:

- Include in  the commission report
- Accounts that  will be affected when an item is purchased or sold



To set up the item defaults, click on the option **Click 
 here to identify the defaults to be used when creating or importing items**.  You will see the **Items** dialog  box.

These defaults can be changed for individual items. Setting item defaults  minimizes the data entry required to set up an item.
