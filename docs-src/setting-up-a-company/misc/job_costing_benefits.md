# ]Job Costing - Benefits


Tracking job costs and revenues gives you the following advantages:

- **Track 
 between fiscal years** - Measure the costs and revenue from a job  that spans over one accounting period or fiscal year.



{:.example}
If the calendar year is your fiscal year,  job costing helps to measure costs of a project undertaken between October  1 and the last day of February.

- **Helps 
 in invoicing** - Customers are invoiced for projects in phases based  on either the cost incurred (in case of cost plus contracts), or the percentage  of work completed (in case of fixed rate contracts). In either case, the  cost incurred on a project done till the date of invoicing is the basis  for raising invoices on the customer.
- **Helps 
 in revenue recognition** - Revenue on projects are normally recognized  only after the completion of a significant percentage of the work is completed.  The revenue recognized is approximately the same percent of the total  sale value as the percentage of work completed.



{:.example}
The sales value of a project is $100,000.  It's estimated cost is $80,000 and the cost incurred to date is $40,000  (50% of estimated costs). If the customer has paid an amount of $75,000,  then the amount to be recognized as sales is $50,000 (50% of sales value).  The balance must be treated as an advance.

- **Capitalize 
 expenses on capital projects** - It helps to capitalize expenses  on major projects.



{:.example}
With job costing, you can track the costs  incurred in construction of a new building. All expenses incurred in the  construction of a building can be capitalized by transferring them from  the expense accounts to the respective asset accounts.

- **Assess 
 which jobs are profitable** - By measuring the actual profits of  a job, job costing allows you to make better pricing decisions.
- **Control 
 cost variances** - Job costing tracks the actual costs incurred as  against the original estimate, when the job is in progress, and thus helps  you to know if the costs are in control.
