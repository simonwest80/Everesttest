Check this box to enable **Everest**  to automatically search for stock in other stock areas/bins if there is  insufficient stock of non-serialized items not tracked for lots and auto-serialized  items in the default stock area/bin when committing items in the sales  order.


This option is enabled if you select the **Use 
 default stock area to assign quantity for non-serialized items in sales 
 documents** check box.

If non-serialized items are tracked for lots,  the **Attach Quantity** dialog box  is displayed irrespective of the preference option.
