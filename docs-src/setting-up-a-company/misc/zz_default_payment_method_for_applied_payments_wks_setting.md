---


Select the payment method that must be used to account for transactions  when you set off the payment due on one document against the payment receivable  on another or vice versa.


{:.example}
**If your customer returns certain damaged items,  you can set off the amount due to you on the sales invoice against the  amount due to the customer on the credit memo by using the payment/refund  options from the document profiles. The Payment Type of accounting entry  created for this transaction defaults to the payment method specified  in this field.**
