title: Purchase Order
---


You would normally commit items on a purchase order when the items are  on approval basis and you want to inspect them and verify their quality.  Use this option to assign a stock area/bin to transfer items received  against a purchase order.


{:.note}
Only a stock area/bin of type 'Out' can be  selected, as items received in this area are not a part of your stock  until a purchase receipt is created for them.


{:.example}
Items received for approval may be moved to a stock area called 'Inspection'.
