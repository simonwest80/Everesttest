# E-Commerce


The **E-Commerce** option is available  both in the **Payment Terms** browser  and the **Payment Term** profile.


Use this option to specify the payment methods that must be linked to  the selected payment term for your online store, using **Everest 
 eStorefront**. Your online customer or shopper can use only those  payment methods that are linked to a payment term.
