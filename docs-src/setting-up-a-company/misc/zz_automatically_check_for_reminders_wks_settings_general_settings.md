Select this check box if you want **Everest**  to automatically check for reminders and specify the frequency for checking  reminders. You can specify a maximum value of 999 seconds.

**If you specify the frequency for checking  reminders in both **Flow Control Preferences**  and **Workstation Settings**, the  value set in **Workstation 
 Settings** takes precedence. Further, if the reminder notification  options are left unchecked in both the **Flow 
 Control Preferences** and **Workstation 
 Settings**, reminders are **NOT**  created in **Everest**.**
