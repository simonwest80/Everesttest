title: Export File Path
---


Specify the location where you want **Everest 
 Reports** to be exported and stored for retrieval at a later date.  If a global or workstation setting is not selected for this field, it  defaults to **My Documents**. On Microsoft  Windows ® Vista systems, the Export File Path defaults to “C:\programdata\everest\temp”.


{:.note}
The path that you enter in this field overrides  the path in the **Export File Path (High 
 Speed)** field in the **Reporting 
 Preferences** (Path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Reporting 
 Preferences** > **Export****Settings** tab).
