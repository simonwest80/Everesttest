# Customer Defaults


When you create a customer, the following fields in the **Customer**  profile are automatically populated by the defaults that you have specified:

- The credit  limit
- The type of  payment terms allowed to the customer
- The default  payment term
- The delivery  method for shipping items to the customers
- The customer  level



Setting defaults and changing them for individual customers minimizes  the data entry required to set up a customer.
