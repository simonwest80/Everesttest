# Inventory - Categories


Categories are groups under which related items are classified. The  item categories created are specific to each business and type of industry.  **Everest** allows you to create any  number of category levels, which enables you to manage them better.


Before the items are imported, you need to categorize them. To create  categories, click **Setup Category**.  You will see the **Category** profile.  At this stage, you can set up a few important categories and the remaining,  as and when required. After importing items, you can reorganize them using  the **Categories Explorer**.
