# Inventory Information


Items are those products and services that you buy and sell in the regular  course of business. Use this section to define item related information  such as the categories to which the items belong, the measures and stock  areas. Setting up inventory comprises the following:

- [Inventory  Categories]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/inventory/inventory_categories.html)
- [Stock  Areas]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/set_up_and_view_stock_areas.html)
- [Measures]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/setup_and_view_measures.html)
- [Items]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/inventory/inventory_setting_up_items.html)
- [Item  Quantities]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/inventory/inventory_setting_up_item_quantities.html)
- [Import  Items]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/inventory/inventory_importing_items.html)



Before the items are imported or created, item categories, measures,  and stock areas need to be set up.
