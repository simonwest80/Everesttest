# Company Creation Wizard - Security


Use the **Company Creation Wizard - Security**  section to add pre-defined security rights to your company. If you prefer,  you can choose to add security rights at a later time which results in  no security rights assigned to user groups during company creation.


You can view the pre-defined security rights before you make your selection.


**Do you want to use the pre-defined security rights  template?**
: Click on the **pre-defined 
 security rights template** link to view the pre-defined security  rights.  The  **Groups** template is displayed.


{:.steps}
To view the rights assigned to the default  groups, do the following:

- Double-click a  group or select a group and press the Enter key.  You  can also right click a group and select **Rights**.   The **Group Rights** dialog box is displayed  for the group you selected.


- After viewing the  rights assigned to the default groups, close the screens to return to  the Company Creation Wizard – Security section.



**Yes, I want to use the pre-defined security rights  template.**
: Select this option to have rights automatically  assigned using the pre-defined security rights template.


**No, I will assign security rights to groups later.**
: Select this option if you do not want default pre-defined  security rights assigned to groups at this time. Your company is created  with no rights assigned to specific groups. After you create your company,  you can add the security rights yourself or you can use the pre-defined  security rights template at that time.

- After you make  your security selection, click **Next**.  You will see the [Other Preferences]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/other-preferences/other_preferences.html)  section.



For more information on security and assigning security to groups, see  [Security]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/security/security_setupco.html).


To use the pre-defined security rights template later after the company  has been created, access the Security section through the Company Setup  Wizard (Path: File > Company Wizard). Use the **Company Setup Wizard 
 – Security** section to reset the security rights to the rights  defined in the pre-defined security rights template.
