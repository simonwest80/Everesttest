# Accounting - Defaults


After you have created your Chart of Accounts, the next step is to set  up the various accounting defaults. Accounting defaults are the accounts  that are affected by default when a system entry is generated. Accounting  entries are automatically created to account for transactions that arise  from your sales, purchase and year-end closing processes such as entries  for cost of goods sold, foreign exchange gains/losses, unreconciled differences  and inventory adjustments. During the closing of the fiscal year, accounting  entries to transfer the profits to your reserves are automatically generated.  Such automatic journal entries are also called system entries. While creating  a new company the Posting Groups that are selected as the company defaults  are system Posting Groups.

Accounting defaults are required during set up for the following reasons:

- Identify the  control accounts for Inventory, Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable.
