# Accounting Segments


Use the Segmented Chart of Accounts in **Everest**  to design the structure of your chart of accounts based on your industry  requirements. Â Your  chart of accounts can be configured by the creation of up to 22 segments  and a maximum of 45 characters. Individual segments represent your company's  reporting structure as you define it. For example, segments can be defined  for division, department, region, account, and sub-account. You can perform  financial analysis for any of the segments that you define in your account  structure. By segmenting your chart of accounts, you gain the ability  to report on selective segments of your account. Consult your Accountant  before creating your chart of accounts segment format.

You can add segments to your segment format  at any time. However, once accounts are created, you cannot change your  format. It is recommended that you take the necessary time to determine  the segment format for your chart of accounts before entering the Company  Creation Wizard.
