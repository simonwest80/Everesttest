# Accounting COA Balances


If your company is an existing entity, you can import the account balances  into **Everest**. Once the Chart of  Accounts is created, you can enter the opening balances for each account  by selecting **Click here to enter opening 
 balances for each account**.


Opening balance represents the balance in an account at the beginning  of any period.


{:.example}
While entering your chart of account balances  in **Everest**, the opening balance  of an account will be the balance in that account as on the date of entering  the balances.


{:.note}
Account balances cannot be initialized until  the **Fiscal Year and Periods** and  **Chart of Accounts** are set up.

- Select **Click 
 here to enter balances for each account**. You will see the [**Chart of Account Balances** dialog box]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/chart_of_account_balances_dialog_box.html).
