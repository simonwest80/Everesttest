# Company Information - Locations/Sub-Locations


**Everest** allows multiple layers  of location classification. You can categorize your company based on functions,  products, locations, profit centers, cost centers or any other criteria  and a combination of these criteria.


A location is at the parent level in the tree hierarchy and a sub-location  forms a child to it, i.e., a sub-locations always falls under a location  in the hierarchy.


{:.example}
You may create the following location/sub-location structure:

- Your places  of business in Virginia and North Carolina can be set up as locations.
- You can then  set up your sales and administration functions as sub-locations for both  Virginia and North Carolina.
- Further, you  can set up sub-locations for the sale of computer hardware and software,  under the sales sub-location in each case.
