# Specifying Vendor Currency


If you have foreign currency dealings with vendors, you have to specify  the currency in which you want to deal. This is specified in the **Currency** **Code**  field of the **Vendor** profile (path:  **Purchasing &gt; Vendors &gt;** **Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Multicurrency** tab).


Thereafter, all transactions with the vendor will be in the currency  specified. You will not be allowed to transact with them in any other  currency.


{:.note}
**You can set up the currency for a vendor only  at the time of creation of the account. Once the **Vendor**  profile is saved, you cannot change the **Currency 
 Code**.**
