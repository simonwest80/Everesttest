# Defining Base Currency and Other Currencies


The base currency is the currency in which your accounting transactions  are carried out. **Everest** provides  a global list of currencies using the ISO codes. You must set up currency  information for the currencies in use such as quote type, amount, short  form, symbol, etc.


The base currency must also be identified in the [Multicurrency  defaults]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/the-company-creation-wizard/accounting/accounting_defaults_setupco.html) .

Once you set up a currency as the base currency, it cannot be changed.


**You must set up the following currencies:**
