# Discontinue a Currency


When you discontinue a record, it is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued record can be 
 made available for selection by activating it again.</font>


**Everest** provides a global list  of currencies using ISO codes. Currencies that are not in use can be discontinued.  Discontinuing a currency does not affect documents or journals already  created with that currency.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a currency, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Multicurrency 
 &gt; Currency**. You will see the **Currencies** browser.
- From the **Currencies** browser, highlight the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">The selected 
 record that was selected is no </font>longer visible in the **Currencies** browser.
