Multicurrency in sales allows you to do the following:

- Maintain customer  accounts in a foreign currency as well as the base currency
- Create sales  quotes, orders and invoices in the customer's currency
- Accept customer  payments in a currency that is different from the bank currency or the  customer currency



{:.example}
**If you have a bank account in UK, all deposits  and issues from the bank will be in GBP  as it is the bank currency.**

- Prepare account  statements in any currency
