# Discontinue a Group


When you discontinue a group, the record is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued group can be made 
 available for selection by activating the group.</font>


Discontinuing a group does not deactivate the users who have been assigned  to the group. The users merely lose the rights that were assigned to the  group. Further, you cannot discontinue a group to which users belong.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a group, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Users &gt; Groups**. You will see the **Groups**  browser.
- From the **Groups** browser, highlight the group.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the **Groups**  browser.
