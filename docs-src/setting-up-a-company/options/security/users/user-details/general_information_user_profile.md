# User - General Information


**Code**
: Generally, the user's initials are used as the user  code, as this helps to recognize the user, when reports are being reviewed.  If multiple users exist with the same initials, sequential numbers suffixed  to the initials can be used to differentiate users. You cannot change  the user code once it is defined.


{:.example}
**User Jane Scarborough  can be assigned the user code JS1 and user John Smith can be assigned  the code JS2.**


**Apply Mask**
: Masks are formats in which telephone numbers and  zip codes must be displayed. You can set up a mask for telephone numbers  and zip codes for each country in the [Country]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/international-set-up/country/profile/the_country_profile.html) **** profile.
: Use this section to select whether masks must be  applied to the current profile or not.

**Join Date**
: The join date identifies the date when the user  joined your company as an employee.


**First and Last name**
: The first and last names together identify the user.  If you are using the **Everest** US  Payroll, these fields are used in employee reports and in printing statutory  forms for the user.
