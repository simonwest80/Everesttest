# User - Address Information


**Address, City and State/Province**
: Specify the address of the user.


**Zip/Postal Code**
: Postal authorities divide the country into areas  and identify each area by means of a postal code. This helps in processing  and delivering mail. The **Zip**/**Postal** **Code**  identifies the postal code for the area in which the address is located.
: Besides zip codes, the United States Postal Services  also uses FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes. FIPS  codes are a finer classification of addresses as a zip code may be applicable  to more than one city or country.
: <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">When the country selected is 
 United States:</font>

- <font color="#000000" class="hcp2">You can specify (select/modify/create) zip codes.</font>



**Country**
: Use this field to specify the country in which the  address is located. **Everest** automatically  populates the **City** and **State/Province** fields when a **Zip/Postal** code  is specified, only if the country selected is the United States.
