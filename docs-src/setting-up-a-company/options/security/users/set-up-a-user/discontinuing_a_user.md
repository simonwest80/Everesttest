# Discontinue a User


When you discontinue a user, the user is not deleted from the database  and is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued user can be made 
 available for selection by activating the user.</font>


Discontinuing a user does not affect documents or journals already created  by that user. Discontinued users cannot log in to your company's database.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a user, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Users &gt; Users**. You will see the **Users** browser.
- From the **Users** browser, highlight the user.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">. The selected 
 record that was selected is no longer </font>visible in the **Users** browser.
