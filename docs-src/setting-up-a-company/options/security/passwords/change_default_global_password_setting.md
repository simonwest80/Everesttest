# Changing Default Global Password Setting


{:.steps}
To change the default setting of the Global password, do  the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control**. You will  see the **Other Flow Control** dialog  box
- Ensure that  the option **Enable global password mode 
 at login**  is not checked.
- Save the changes.



However, leaving the Global Password **ON**  is potentially dangerous. If a computer is left unguarded even for a few  minutes, someone can make erroneous data entry or access confidential  information.


You can toggle the Global Password option by clicking the **Password**  option on the status bar. It is recommended that you toggle **OFF**,  whenever you leave the computer.
