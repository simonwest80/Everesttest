# User defined Security Rights


When you create a document alias or payment method, you may define a  security right to control access to it. A user with the specified security  right, can use that payment method, when accounting for payments and receipts  or the document alias, when creating a sales or purchase document.


User defined security rights are also called dynamic rights. These rights  can be defined in the following areas:

- Custom Tracking
- Document Alias
- Payment Methods
- Find Filters


- Find items
- Find vendors
- Find customers
- Find account activity
- Find tasks/appointments
- Find documents



{:.note}
An audit trail is created in the **Everest 
 Event History** browser every time a particular user's credentials  are overridden by a user with more access privileges. This information  can assist with determining additional rights needed by a user.
