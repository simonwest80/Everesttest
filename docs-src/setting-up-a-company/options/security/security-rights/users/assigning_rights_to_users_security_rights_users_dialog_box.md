# Assigning Rights to Users - Security Rights Browser


Use the **Security Rights** browser  to specify the users who must have a particular right or to view the users  assigned to an individual security right. You can assign a security right  to multiple users at the same time. You can also assign security rights  to groups and view the groups assigned to a specific security right from  this browser.


{:.note}
An audit trail is created in the **Everest 
 Event History** browser every time a particular user's credentials  are overridden by a user with more access privileges. This information  can assist with determining additional rights needed by a user.
