# Group Rights


Groups of users can be assigned rights in the same manner as rights  are assigned to individual users.


A user inherits all access rights of the group the individual belongs  to. An individual user can be granted additional rights that the group  does not have, but cannot be denied rights that the group has.


{:.note}
**You cannot assign rights to a few individual  users in a group. You have to assign rights to all the users in a group.  During the initial setup of **Everest**,  the Supervisor group is created by default. You can add users requiring  administrative rights to this group. This will give users rights to all  functions. This is a system group and cannot be discontinued.**


Groups can be assigned rights in any one of the following ways:

- From the [**Groups**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/security/security-rights/groups/assigning_rights_to_groups_groups_browser.html)  browser
- From the [**Security Rights**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/security/security-rights/groups/assigning_rights_to_groups_security_rights_groups_dialog_box.html) browser
