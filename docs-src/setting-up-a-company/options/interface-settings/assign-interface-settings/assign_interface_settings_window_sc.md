Use this tab to assign the templates to groups. You will see the groups  available for group assignment in the right hand panel of the window.

Use this tab to assign the templates to individual users. Users can  be assigned to only one template.

# Assign Interface Settings Window


Use the **Assign** **Interface 
 Settings** window to assign selected interface settings to individual  users and user groups. You can also view the users or groups assigned  to a particular interface settings template. The left panel of the **Assign Interface Settings** window contains  the interface settings templates that you can assign to users or groups.  Click the **Users** tab for users  interface settings assignments and click the **Groups**  tab for group interface settings assignments.

- [Groups](javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)){:id="a1"}<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a1');
//--></script>
- [Users](javascript:kadovTextPopup(this)){:id="a2"}<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"><!--
kadovTextPopupInit('a2');
//--></script>



If there are conflicts between group assignments and user assignments,  the group assignment will be overridden by the user assignment.


{:.note}
: If you are not individually assigned a template  and you have multiple group assignments with different templates, the  system will choose the template to use alphabetically.


When a user group is changed, no change is made to the user’s settings  regardless of what template is assigned to the user’s new group. The system  will remind you when you change the group that a user belongs to that  you may need to change their interface settings. The following message  will be shown:


‘The interface settings for any users reassigned to new groups will  not be changed. Changes to user’s interface settings can be made from  the Interface Settings browser.’
