# Interface Settings


The **Interface Settings**  browser enables you to save customizations made to the **Everest**  interface. Each user will be able to have their own settings. These settings  will be shown no matter where the user logs in to **Everest**.   And users  who use the same machine will be able to see their own settings. Interface  Settings for each user consist of all customizations they have made to:

- Main  menu and main tool bar settings
- Browser  settings (including browser properties, menu and toolbar)
- Profile  Settings (including menu and tool bar)
- Login  settings



You can also create Interface Settings templates customized  to meet the needs of specific groups of users.  These  templates can then be assigned to individual users or to groups.


{:.example}
: Suppose a company is doing well and decides to hire  new sales associates to supplement the existing sales person they employ.   The user  settings of the existing sales person can be copied into a template, and  that template can be assigned to the new sales associates.  Now  their interface is already customized to allow them to do their job efficiently.   They can  make any individual changes they require without changing the template,  but most of the customization work is already done for them.


The **Interface Settings**  browser shows both user settings and templates that have been created.


**User Settings** are  the actual settings that each user sees when he/she logs into **Everest**.  These are created by the system when a new user is added to **Everest**.   Initially  they are set to the default settings for the given version of **Everest**.   However,  the user can make any customizations to the settings and these settings  will take effect immediately.


**Settings Templates**  are created by users of the system. Users can save the changes made to  the templates and assign to users/groups. Applying templates will overwrite  the customizations made by users.  However,  any changes made to a user’s settings after the template is applied affect  only that user’s settings and do not affect the template.


{:.note}
- If an administrator  makes changes to another user’s settings while that user is logged in,  the changes made to the user’s settings will not take effect until the  next time that user logs into **Everest**.  If you change your own settings, those changes will be reflected immediately.
- When you save the  changes made to a template, these changes will not be reflected to the  assigned Users/Groups until they are applied.
