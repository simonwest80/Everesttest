# The Location Profile - Accounts


Use the **Accounts** tab to specify  the accounts to use for the Customer, Vendor, Inventory, and Fixed Asset  control accounts for the **Location**  being defined. You can also specify the default general ledger accounts  to use for current earnings, unreconciled differences, and rounding differences  for this location.


If you leave the accounts blank, the accounting default accounts will  be used, provided that the account has not been defined at any other level,  such as **Customer** profile or customer  class for customer control accounts or **Vendor**  profile or vendor class for vendor control accounts. You can view the  company accounting defaults in the **Accounting** dialog box – **Accounts** tabs  (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Defaults**  > **Accounting** > **Accounts**  tab).


Control accounts contain balances of related accounts. For example,  the Inventory Control Account contains the balance of all items in inventory.  It would be impractical to have a separate account for each item. Identifying  control accounts ensures that important items are accounted for correctly,  improves financial analysis, and helps to prevent errors.


The drop-down for each field displays the accounts that are available  for selection. The accounts defined in the **Accounts**  tabs will be used to default the relevant accounts in a transaction/journal.


{:.example}
A Sales account selected on the Sales tab  will be used in a sales transaction to default the customer related account,  provided the account has not been defined at any other level (like customer  profile, customer class or document location level).
