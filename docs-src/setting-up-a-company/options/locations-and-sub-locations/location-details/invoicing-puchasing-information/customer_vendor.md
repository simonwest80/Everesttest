# Customer/Vendor


Every location can have a different series of vendor and customer codes.  This simplifies the identification of customers and vendors by location.  Further, the code can be prefixed with a numeric abbreviation of the location.  If the customer/vendor code field is left blank, the sequence numbers  specified for the location of the login  location/sub-location are used. If sequence numbers are not specified  in the **Location** profile, the sequence  numbers specified in the default location are used.


{:.example}
**If you specify 10000 as the **Customer Code** in the **Distribution**  location, the account code for the next customer will be 10000.**
