# Accounting Information


Every location can have a separate sequence number for journals. You  can specify only one set of sequence numbers for journals generated by  a location. Both manual and system journals follow this sequence.


The sequence numbers specified for the location of the login  location/sub-location are used. If sequence numbers are not specified  in the **Location** profile, the sequence  numbers specified in the default location are used.
