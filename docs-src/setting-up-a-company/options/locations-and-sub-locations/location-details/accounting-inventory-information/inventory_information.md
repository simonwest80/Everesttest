# Inventory Information


Every location can have separate serial numbers for items and sequence  numbers for inventory documents. The serial and sequence numbers specified  for the location of the login  location/sub-location are used. If serial/sequence numbers are not specified  in the **Location** profile, the numbers  specified in the default location are used.
