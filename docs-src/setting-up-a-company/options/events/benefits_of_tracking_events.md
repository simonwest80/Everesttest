# Benefits of Tracking Events


Events can be used for the following:

- **Creating 
 an audit trail** - By logging critical events such as modification  of customers, items, or sales and purchase documents, you can maintain  an audit trail with the time when the event took place, the user responsible  for the event, and the record that was created or modified.
- **Triggering 
 e-mails** - To trigger e-mail  on the occurrence of an event, you need to create activities and e-mail  templates and associate them with the event. By assigning an e-mail  template to an event and entering the e-mail  addresses of the persons to be mailed, you can trigger the e-mail  to be sent whenever the event takes place.
