# Events


Events are a pre-defined list of all significant activities in **Everest**. Events are triggered as a result  of functions accessed by users and user groups.


The list of events in **Everest**  are triggered by activities such as creation of records or transactions,  modification of a record, modification of important fields in records,  printing reports, logging in and logging out.


The list of all the events tracked by **Everest** can be viewed from the **Events** browser. Not only can you Â track  the occurrence of an event, but also trigger e-mails when an event occurs.  To trigger an e-mail  on the occurrence of an event, you need to create activities and e-mail  templates and associate it with the event.
