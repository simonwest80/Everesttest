# Status Information


Use the **Status** option to specify  the status of a job. The options are **Open**  and **Close**. When a job is created,  the status by default is "Open". Once a job is completed and  you receive all the payments and receipts pertaining to the job, you can  mark the job as "Close". A closed job is no longer available  on documents and journals.


{:.note}
**A job must be marked as "Close"  after receiving all payments and receipts. Otherwise, you cannot account  for expenses even if the job is completed.**
