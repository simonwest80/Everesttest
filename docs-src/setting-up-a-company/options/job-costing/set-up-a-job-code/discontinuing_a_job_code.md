# Discontinue a Job Code


When you discontinue a job code, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is deactivated. A discontinued job code can be made available  for selection by activating it. Further expenses or revenue cannot be  allocated to the discontinued job code.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a job code, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Miscellaneous &gt; Job Explorer**. You will see the **Job 
 Explorer**.
- From the **Job Explorer**, highlight the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is not </font>visible in the **Job 
 Explorer**.



{:.note}
You cannot discontinue a job code that is  associated with a promotion. However, it is possible to do so if the promotion  has expired.
