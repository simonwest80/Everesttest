**Code and Description**
: The code is the unique identifier of the payment  term while the description specifies the name of the payment term. Once  a payment term is defined, you cannot modify the code.


**Payment Term Type**


Use this option to select the type of payment term. The following options  are available:

- **On 
 Account -** Select this option for payment to be made  on credit.
- **COD**  - Select this option for payment to be received from the customer or made  to the vendor only on the delivery of goods.
- **Prepay**  - When you select this option, the customerâ€™s goods are shipped only when  the payment is made in full or in part. This is also applicable for payments  made to the vendor, before the shipment of goods begins.

: When a sales order with prepay terms is converted  to a sales invoice, **Everest** prompts  you with the same, subject to the preference set in the **Documents**  dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts &gt; Sales Documents 
 &gt; Sales Documents 1 &gt; Method for applying deposit collected on a 
 sales order when converting it into a sales invoice**).


{:.note}
On selecting the **COD**  or **Prepay** options, the **Due 
 Date Typ**e field in the **Due****Date** **Information**  section is disabled.


{:.hint}
For credit cards, you would ideally set up the payment term as prepaid.


**Web-enabled**
: Use this option to make the payment term available  on the **Everest eStorefront** store.
