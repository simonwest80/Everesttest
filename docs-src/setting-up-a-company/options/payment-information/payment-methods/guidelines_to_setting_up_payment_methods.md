# Guidelines for Setting Up Payment Methods


The following are a few thumb rules to set up payment methods:

1. Set up a payment  method for each type of payment like cash, check and wire transfers.
- Set up a payment  method for each clearing account of the same payment type. You would reconcile  these accounts with your bank statement.



{:.example}
If you deposit check payments into two different  bank accounts, you have to set up a payment method for each account. You  also need to set up payment methods for customers and vendors separately.

1. To process  credit card payments in **Everest**,  set up a payment method for each payment service that you use.

1. To use ICVerify  payment software for credit card processing, you must set up a payment  method for each card type that you accept such as Visa, MasterCard and  also Discover. To use a sequence number for each cash counter, you must  set up a payment method for each cash counter and for each card type.



{:.example}
If you have two counters and accept Visa and  MasterCard, you must set up four payment methods - ICVerify Visa – Counter  1, ICVerify Visa – Counter 2, ICVerify MasterCard - Counter 1 and ICVerify  MasterCard - Counter 2.
