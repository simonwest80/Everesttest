# Discontinue a Payment Method


Payment methods which are not required can be discontinued. When you  discontinue a payment method, the record is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. A discontinued payment method can be made available  for selection by activating it again.


If the default payment method for a customer or vendor is discontinued,  when you make or receive payments, **Everest**  informs you that the payment method does not exist. You can then select  the required payment method.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a payment method, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Payment Methods**. You will see the **Payment 
 Methods** browser.
- From the **Payment Methods** browser, highlight the  record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**. The selected  record is no longer visible in the **Payment 
 Methods** browser.
