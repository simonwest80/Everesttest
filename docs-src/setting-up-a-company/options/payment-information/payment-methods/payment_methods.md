# Â Payment  Methods


Payments made or received can be of several types.


{:.example}
<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Cash, Company Check, Visa, Master Card, Wire Transfer, 
 etc.</font>


Setting up payment methods simplifies and speeds up the data entry,  when payments are made or received.


Generally, two sets of payment methods are defined:

- <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">For </font>[customer  collections]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/customer_and_vendor_payment_methods.html)<font color="#000000" class="hcp1"> </font>
- <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">For </font>[payments  to vendors]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/customer_and_vendor_payment_methods.html)<font color="#000000" class="hcp1"> </font>



The payment methods created by default when a new company is created  are listed below:
