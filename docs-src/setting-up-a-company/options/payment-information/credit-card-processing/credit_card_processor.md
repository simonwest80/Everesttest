# Credit Card Processor


When credit card payment methods are created, the processor to be used  for authorization has to be defined. Processors for credit card payment  authorization are not defined for the default payment methods created,  when a new company is set up.


You must define processor details as given to you by the payment service  or software supplier before defining a credit card payment method. The  **Processor** profile enables you  to create processors for each payment method.


You can set up a processor that will use any of the following services:

- ICVerify
- Payflow Pro
