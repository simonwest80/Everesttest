# How Credit Card Processing Works


You cannot obtain approval for the payment directly from the customer's  bank. You must subscribe to a payment service like Payflow Pro or buy  a payment software like ICVerify.


The payment service/software connects to the network of financial institutions  through a payment gateway. Through the payment network, the customer's  account is accessed and the availability of funds is verified. Finally,  you are informed whether the payment is approved or not.
