# Configuration File for ICVerify


**Everest** uses request files (.REQ)  to communicate with ICVerify which responds with answer files (.ANS) that  contain approval/denied details. **Everest**  has a default format for processing such requests and responses, however  the format required by processing networks can vary. To handle these differences  in required formats, **Everest** has  a .INI file that allows you to configure the format used by **Everest**  to communicate with ICVerify.


If you are configuring ICVerify for Multiple Merchants, see the **Configuring 
 ICVerify for Multiple Merchants** section.


**Transaction Requests**


A transaction request is generated by **Everest**  whenever a credit card transaction is processed. These transaction requests  are recorded in the directory that you specify for each processor in the  **Processor**  profile (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Processors &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; in New Window &gt; 
 Settings** tab **&gt; Request Directory 
 Name** field).


Request files will include several parameters describing the accounting  number and other details of the transaction.

**Identifying the Transaction Format for a Processor**


Two methods of identifying the correct format for transactions with  your Merchant Bank Provider exist.


Method 1


Use the Transaction Builder tool that is included with ICVerify 4.0.   This tool  is part of the ICVerfiy SDK and can be used to view the correct format  for each transaction type and merchant bank.


Method 2


Use the **/gx**  switch in ICVerify to display the format for .REQ  files for each processor.

**Create an ICVerify Configuration File**


You can create an ICVerify Configuration file using Notepad.
