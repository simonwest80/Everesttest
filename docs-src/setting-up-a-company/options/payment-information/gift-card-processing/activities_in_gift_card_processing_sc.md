# Activities in Gift Card Processing


The main activities involved in gift card processing are:

- Validating the  gift card number.
- Validating the  card value.
- Obtaining approval  from the financial institution.



You must set up gift cards as an item in **Everest**  for selling gift cards.

Prior to setting up the gift card as an Item, you need to  set up a liability account. We recommend a separate liability account  for each type of “Gift Card” if you set up gift cards and promotional  cards or have gift cards through multiple providers.

You will need to open an account with a gift  card provider such as Valutec, a service provider for gift cards.
