# Create an Accrued Liability Account for Gift Cards


You must specify an accrued liability account that will be  affected when payments are made or received for gift cards. If you do  not have an accrued liability account, you must create one.


We recommend a separate liability account for each type of  “Gift Card” if you set up gift cards and promotional cards or have gift  cards through multiple providers.


{:.steps}
To create an Accrued Liability Account for  gift cards, do the following:

- From the **Everest** main menu, select **Accounting**  > **Chart of Accounts**.
- Select **New**  > **In New Window** or press the  **Insert** key. You will see the **Chart of Accounts** profile.
- Enter the information  for your accrued gift card liability account according to the setup of  your chart of accounts. Be sure to select **Detail**  for the Posting Level and **Bank**  for the Account Type as shown in the example in the following figure.

- **Save**  the profile to create your new accrued gift card liability account.



You will need to select this account when you set up Gift  Card as a payment method.
