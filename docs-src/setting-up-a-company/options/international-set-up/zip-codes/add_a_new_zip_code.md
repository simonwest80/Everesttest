# Add a New Zip Code


{:.steps}
To add a new zip code, do the following:

- Identify the  city, county and state for which you want to add a zip code.
- Check the existing  code for the city, county, state and FIPS (for US only).
- From the **Everest** main menu, select **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Zip Code**. You will see the **Zip** **Codes**  browser.
- From the **Zip** **Codes**  browser, select **Options &gt; New &gt; 
 In New Window**. You will see the **Zip Code** profile.
- Enter the zip  code and the codes for the city, county and state in the **General**  tab of the **Zip** **Code**  profile.
- Select **Options &gt; Save** to save the profile.



{:.note}
- You can add  zip codes only in an **Extended****Mode** setting (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).
- You can make  use of the Advanced Query Builder to identify the list of new US zip codes  and use this data to generate a report.
- To enter a  new zip code that is not available in the drop-down, you should have sufficient  security rights. The new US zip code is not added to the zip code table,  but it gets stored in the relevant customer, vendor, user, location, web  shops and wish lists information.

Hillsborough  code = 057


Lutz code  = 41775


FL Code = 12
