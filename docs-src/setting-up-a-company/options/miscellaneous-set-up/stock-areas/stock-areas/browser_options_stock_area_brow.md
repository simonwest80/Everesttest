# The Stock Area Browser


The **Stock Areas** browser (path:  **Inventory &gt; Stock Areas**) displays  all the stock areas/bins that are defined. This browser also displays  the value of the items in each stock area/bin, the location, the warehouse  position, the stock level, the stock type and the area type (in or out).  By default, the Stock Area browser will appear in two panels. The left  panel displays the stock areas and stock bins in tree-view and the right  panel displays it in a browser.


The stock area browser has the following options:

- [Tree-view]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/tree_view_stockareabrowser.html)
- [List  of items]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/list_of_items.html)
- [List  of total quantity]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/list_of_total_quantity.html)



The **Stock Areas** browser has  **View** menu with following options:


**Normal Bins Only**
: Select this option to view only the “Normal” Bin  Types.


**Include Out Bins**
: Select this option to view “Normal” and “Out” Bin  Types.


**Discontinued**
: Select this option to view discontinued records  in **View Discontinued** browser.


**Retrieve all Bins**
: Select this option to view all the bins of the selected  stock area.


The **Stock Areas** browser also  has the options that are common to all browsers in **Everest**.
