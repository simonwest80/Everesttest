# Multimedia


**Everest** allows you to attach  multiple multimedia files such as a picture to the item, vendor, customer,  user and serial number profiles, tasks and documents. These pictures may  be of the person, the company headquarters, a letterhead, a map with directions  to their location, or anything else to represent the record.


The multimedia files can be in any format such as text files, image  files or video files. These files are copied to the respective folder  based on the extension of the file.

- For items,  customers, vendors, documents, users, tasks and serial numbers, highlight  a record and select **Options &gt; Multimedia** from the respective browser. You will see the [**Multimedia Setup** browser]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/misc/multimedia_setup_browser.html).
