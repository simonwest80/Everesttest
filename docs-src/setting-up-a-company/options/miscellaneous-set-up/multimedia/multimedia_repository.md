# Multimedia Repository


The multimedia repository is a directory in which the multimedia files  are located. The check box will be enabled only when the **Multimedia 
 Repository** directory is specified in the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab) or in the default preferences (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Other Defaults**).


{:.steps}
To specify the multimedia repository, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings**. You will see the **Workstation 
 Settings** dialog box.
- In the **Multimedia Repository** field of the **Company Settings** tab, specify the directory  where multimedia files must be located.



{:.note}
- If you change the  Multimedia Repository path, all files in the Multimedia Repository can  be accessed from the new location provided that they are manually moved  to the new location.
- The global repository  specified in the **Other Defaults**  dialog box should be shared across the network with full rights. All users  can then access the file attachments specified in the **Multimedia**  browser.


When you specify the multimedia repository paths, the local repository  specified in the **Workstation Settings**  takes precedence over the global one defined in the **Other 
 Default** preferences. Only when the local repository is not specified,  **Everest** copies the file to the  global repository.


If the multimedia repository is specified neither in the Workstation  Settings nor in the default preferences, **Everest**  informs you that the files will not be copied to the global multimedia  repository. The option **Copy to Multimedia 
 Repository** is disabled in the profiles and the files are accessed  from the path from where they are attached. The file is available only  to the user who saves the file and cannot be viewed by other users.
