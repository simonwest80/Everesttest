# Create a Custom Field


By default, only four character fields, date fields, logical fields  or numeric fields are displayed in the **Custom 
 Fields** dialog box. You can create additional custom fields of any  type.


The new custom field for a record is added to all other similar records.


{:.example}
A new custom field is created for keeping  track of the 'Primary Vendor' of an item. All other items will also have  the 'Primary Vendor' custom field.


Whenever custom fields are created, the field names should be unique  for that particular profile. There should be no duplication within the  profile. Any duplication will give you an error message. However, the  same custom field names can exist in different profiles.


{:.example}
In the **Item**  profile, you may have **Color** as  a character custom field. When a new custom field is created in the same  profile, it should not be **Color**  in the Numeric, Logical, Date or Memo types of custom fields, but the  same field name can exist in other profiles.


{:.steps}
To create a custom field, do the following:

- From the **Custom Fields** dialog box, select **Options &gt; New Custom Field**. You will  see the [**Custom 
 Field Definition** profile]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/miscellaneous-set-up/custom-fields/custom-field-definition-profile/custom_field_definition_profile.html).
