# Discontinue a Delivery Method


<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Delivery methods that are not required can be discontinued. 
 </font>When you discontinue a delivery method, the record is not deleted  from the database; it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued 
 delivery method can be made available for selection by activating it again.</font>


If the default delivery method for a customer or vendor is discontinued  when you create a document, **Everest**  informs you that the delivery method does not exist.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a delivery method, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Freight &gt; Delivery Methods**. You will see the **Delivery 
 Methods** browser.
- From the **Delivery Methods** browser, highlight  the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**. The selected record that was selected  is no longer visible in the **Delivery 
 Methods** browser.
