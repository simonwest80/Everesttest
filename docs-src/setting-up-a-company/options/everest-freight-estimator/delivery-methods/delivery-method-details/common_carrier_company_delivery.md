# Common Carrier Company Delivery


A common carrier is used to deliver the products to the customer's address.  When a customer picks up the items from your store, the delivery method  is <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">'</font>Customer Pickup<font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">',</font>  which is not a common carrier delivery.


Therefore, use this option to denote if you are actually delivering  products to the customer's Ship to Address or whether the products are  being picked up from your location (Point of Sale).


{:.example}
**Uncheck  the common carrier for 'PICKUP' or 'RETAIL', but check this option for  'FEDEX'.**


The common carrier option plays an important role in determining the  tax jurisdiction of a sales document. For Point of Sale documents, the  tax rate applicable for the logged in jurisdiction is applied. The tax  rate for other sales is determined by the location where the items are  delivered.
