# Delivery Methods


Delivery methods are the methods by which items are delivered to your  customer or received from your vendor. A single carrier may provide delivery  services of varying kinds. You can opt for a certain delivery method according  to your specific requirement. You can use the same delivery method for  receiving or issuing items.


Some of the Delivery Methods created when setting up your company are  listed below:


| Code | Description |
| CDEL | Company Delivery |
| COU | Courier |
| CPIC | Customer Pickup |
| FEDX1 | Fedex Priority Overnight |
| FEDX2 | Fedex 2 Day |
| FEDXS | Fedex Standard Overnight |
| UPSB | UPS Next Day Air |
| UPSG | UPS Ground Commercial |
| UPSR | UPS Next Day Air |



You can define additional methods as needed. Delivery methods provide  information to the shipment department on how all deliveries are to be  made.

- Compute the  freight on item sales.
