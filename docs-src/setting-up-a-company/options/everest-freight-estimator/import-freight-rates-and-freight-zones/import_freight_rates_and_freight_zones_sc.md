# Import Freight Rates and Freight Zones


Freight estimation in **Everest**  is not limited to the freight calculations based on weight or other options  available in the **Zone** and **Rate** profiles.


Extensive freight estimation is possible in **Everest**  by importing freight details from the respective carrier websites such  as UPS and FedEx. **Everest** calculates  the freight based on the zones and rates defined by these carriers.


{:.note}
You can download the freight zones and rates  for UPS and FedEx from www.ups.com and www.fedex.com. You can import them  into **Everest** in the appropriate  format.


Use the **Data Import Wizard** (path:  **Utility** > **Import**  > **Data**) to import the freight  rates and freight zones. The freight zones must be imported before the  freight rates since the rates are defined for the zones.
