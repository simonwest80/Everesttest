# Zone Details


You can specify the details of the zone where an order is to be dispatched.  The zone could be a single state, a country, or a region, depending on  how you want to charge freight on shipments. These zones are created so  that the freight charges are calculated for a smaller region. The **Zone Details** profile allows you to specify  origin and destination details for each zone. When computing freight,  **Everest** looks at the shipping  address, and if a zone is defined for the address, it applies the rate,  if any, defined for the zone.


{:.steps}
To create a new zone detail, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File** > **Setup** > **Freight**  > **Zone** **Details**.  You will see the **Zone** **Details**  browser.
- From the **Zone** **Details**  browser, select **Options** > **New** > **In 
 New Window**. You will see the [**Zone Details**]({{site.sc_baseurl}}/options/everest-freight-estimator/zone-details/destination_zone_details_profile.html) profile.
