# Â FIPS  Codes


The FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) code is a 10-digit  numeric code comprising the 2-digit state code, 3-digit county code and  3-digit city/town code. This combination of state, county and city is  unique and cannot be duplicated across the United States. FIPS codes are  applicable only in the United States.


They are used for greater accuracy, corroborating the Zip Codes, in  identifying the Tax Jurisdiction for a city/state/county in the United  States.


You do not need to have knowledge of the FIPS codes. Given a city/town  and zip code combination, **Everest**  determines the appropriate FIPS Code for the customer or jurisdiction.
