# Tax Jurisdictions


Tax jurisdiction is the authority for assessing and collecting the liability  of sales tax. To comply with the requirements of the taxing authority,  sales must be reported to them as required.


Reporting requirements for tax vary from state to state and country  to country. Some states require only total taxable sales and exempt sales  to be reported. In this case, you can set up only one tax jurisdiction  for the state. Other states require county/city-wise breakdown of tax.  In this case you will set up a tax jurisdiction for each county/city.


The state sales tax authority provides you with this requirement. Based  on your state's requirements, create a jurisdiction code for each region.


**The concept of tax jurisdictions is extremely  important. It determines the following:**

- Jurisdiction-wise  breakup of sales
- Sales tax per  jurisdiction

**The liability for sales tax is recorded only  when the final documents are created. These liabilities are reported in  the **Sales** **Tax****Report**.**
