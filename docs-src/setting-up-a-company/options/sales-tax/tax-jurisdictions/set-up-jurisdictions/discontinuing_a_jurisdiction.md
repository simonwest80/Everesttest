# Discontinue a Jurisdiction


When you discontinue a jurisdiction, the record is not deleted from  the database; it is deactivated. A discontinued jurisdiction can be made  available for selection by activating it.


{:.note}
You cannot discontinue an existing default  jurisdiction without creating another default jurisdiction.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a jurisdiction, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Jurisdictions**. You will see the **Jurisdictions** browser.
- From the **Jurisdictions** browser, highlight the  record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the **Jurisdictions**  browser.
