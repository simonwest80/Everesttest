# Special Tax Rules


Special tax rules are defined for any exemptions or deviations from  the usual rate of tax for a jurisdiction/state. You may set them up for  a particular customer or class of customers, and/or for a particular item  or category of items or any combination of customer/class and item/category.


{:.example}
**If in a jurisdiction, the normal rate of tax  is 5%, any item/ category of items or customer /class of customers to  be exempted or taxed at a different rate will be brought under a special  tax rule.**


Special tax rules may also specify a limit on the price per item, wherever  applicable.
