# Discontinue a Tax Code


When you discontinue a tax code, it is not deleted from the database;  it is deactivated. <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">A discontinued tax code can be 
 made available for selection by activating it.</font>


You may need to discontinue a tax code if any of its components have  changed, and it is no longer applicable to any jurisdiction that you have  defined. This does not affect documents or journals already created with  that tax code.


{:.note}
If a tax code is assigned to a jurisdiction/special  tax rule it cannot be discontinued.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a tax code, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Tax Code**. You will see the **Tax 
 Codes** browser.
- From the **Tax Codes** browser, highlight the record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">. The selected 
 record is no longer </font>visible in the **Tax 
 Codes** browser.
