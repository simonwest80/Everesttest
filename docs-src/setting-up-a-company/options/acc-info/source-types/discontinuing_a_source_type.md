# Discontinue a Source Type


When you discontinue a source type, the record is not deleted from the  database; it is deactivated. <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">A discontinued record 
 can be made available for selection by activating it again.</font>


{:.note}
You  cannot discontinue a system source type. Discontinuing a source type does  not affect documents or journals that are already created using that source  type.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a source type, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Source Types**. You will see the **Source 
 Types** browser.
- From the **Source Types** browser, highlight the  record.
- Select **Options &gt; Discontinue**. You will be  prompted for confirmation.
- Click **OK**. The selected record is no longer  visible in the **Source Types** browser.
