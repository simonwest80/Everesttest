# <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">Assigning Journal Groups</font>


After the journal groups are created, they must be assigned to the workstation  journals. System journals are automatically grouped after this process.  Journal groups can be assigned in any of the following ways:

- Manually, by  specifying a journal group in the **Journal 
 Group** field.
- Automatically,  for all system journals, by specifying a journal group in the **Journal 
 Group** field of the **Work Station 
 Settings** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preference &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab). This setting is applicable for the workstation on which it is specified.
