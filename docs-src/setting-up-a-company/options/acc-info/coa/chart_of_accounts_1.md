# Chart of Accounts


The **Chart of Accounts** is a list  of all the accounts for the company and is the heart of any accounting  system. Information entered from each transaction within **Everest**  accumulates in these accounts. The structure of the chart of accounts  determines the details available for financial reports.


Accounts can be of the types: general or detailed. A general account  is at the parent level and can have other general or detailed accounts  under it. Transaction amounts are posted to the detail accounts but the  general account balance shows the total of all the accounts defined under  it.


{:.note}
**There is no limit to the number of levels  in your Chart of Accounts.**
