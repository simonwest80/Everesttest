# Multicurrency Information


Use the **Multicurrency** tab to indicate the currency in which an account is maintained. **Everest** maintains the balance of such  accounts in the foreign currency indicated in this tab and the base currency.  All transactions in this account are recorded in the foreign currency.


{:.example}
If your company has a bank account in Paris  and all transactions are in Francs, you will set up this account as a  foreign currency account.


**Currency Code**
: Accounts such as foreign currency borrowings need  to be maintained in your records as foreign currency. This field specifies  the currency in which the account is to be maintained. The balance details  of the account can be viewed in terms of both, the base and the foreign  currency.

**Remeasurement  Required**
: All asset, liability and capital accounts have to  be remeasured at the end of the fiscal year, when accounts are being closed,  so that they are stated at their actual values in your final accounts.  Checking this box enables this. The remeasurement  details are updated when the remeasurement utility is executed (path:  **Accounting &gt; Account Remeasurement**).


{:.example}
If you operate in the United States and have  invested in bonds denominated in the foreign currency, you would set up  the account as a foreign currency account. At the end of the fiscal year,  when your final accounts are drawn up, you would need to re-compute their  value with the prevailing exchange rates.
