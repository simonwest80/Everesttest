**Account Code and Description**
: The account code is unique throughout **Everest**.  Once defined, the code cannot be changed. You can use an alphanumeric  code for easier identification of account types.


{:.example}
Prefix asset accounts with ‘A’ and expense accounts with ‘E’.


**Account Class**
: This is a display field and indicates whether the  account is an asset, liability, expense, revenue or capital. The class  to which the general account, at the top of the hierarchy, belongs, determines  the account class of any account under it.


{:.example}
If the Petty Cash account has the following  hierarchy: **Assets &gt; Current Assets 
 &gt; Cash &gt; Petty Cash**, the class for Assets becomes the class  for Petty Cash.
