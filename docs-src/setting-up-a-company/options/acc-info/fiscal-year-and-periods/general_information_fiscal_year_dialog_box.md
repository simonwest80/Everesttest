# Fiscal Period Setup Details


**Fiscal Year**
: Enter the fiscal year.


{:.example}
Enter 2001 in this field if you are creating the fiscal period for the  year 2001.


**Description**
: Enter a description for the fiscal year.


{:.example}
<font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">For the year 2001, the description may be specified 
 as <font face="Verdana" class="hcp7">'</font>Fiscal Year 2001<font face="Verdana" class="hcp7">'</font>.</font>


**Start Date**
: Enter the beginning date of the fiscal period. This  field is enabled only when you are setting up the fiscal year for the  first time. Thereafter, the start date is computed by **Everest**  based on the end date of the previous fiscal year.


**End Date**
: The end date is automatically computed based on  the previous yearâ€™s settings.


{:.example}
The year 2001 was defined with the number  of periods as 12, the start date as January 1, 2001 and the end date as  December 31, 2001. When you create the fiscal year 2002, the start date  will be January 1, 2002. This date cannot be edited. The end date is automatically  computed as December 31, 2002. This date may be changed as per your requirement.


**Number of Periods**
: The number of periods that comprise a fiscal year  could be different for different companies. The possibilities are listed  in the table below:


| Number of Periods | Description |
| 1 | One full-year period |
| 2 | Two half-year periods |
| 3 | Three four-month periods |
| 4 | Four three-month periods |
| 6 | Six bi-monthly  periods |
| 12 | Twelve monthly periods (this is the most frequently  used) |
| 13 | Thirteen four-week periods |



**Status**
: This is a display field and indicates the status  of the fiscal year. By default, a new year being defined has the status  **Open**. Once the accounts are closed  for a year, the status changes to **Lock**.


{:.note}
You can neither edit the status of a period  for a closed year, nor can you make any entries to a closed year or a  locked period
