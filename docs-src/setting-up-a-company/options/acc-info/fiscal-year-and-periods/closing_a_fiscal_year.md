# <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">Closing a Fiscal Year</font>


A fiscal year can be closed after your company's accounts are finalized.  The revenue and expense accounts become nil and the net income is transferred  to the **Current Earnings Account**  defined in Preferences (path: **File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Accounts &gt; 
 Other Accounts** tab). Balances of assets and liabilities are carried  forward to the successive fiscal year.


To close a fiscal year, select **Close 
 Year** from **Accounting &gt; Year 
 End**. The Year End options are enabled if your company is registered.
