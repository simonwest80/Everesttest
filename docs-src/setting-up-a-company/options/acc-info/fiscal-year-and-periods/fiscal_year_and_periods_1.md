# <font color="#000000" class="hcp1">Fiscal Year and Periods</font>


The financial results of a business have to be reported to diverse groups  such as shareholders, lenders, the government and the stock exchange,  in terms of net income measured for a time period, which is normally a  year. This is known as the fiscal year or the accounting year of the company.


The fiscal year may be a calendar year or any period of twelve months.  In certain situations, the fiscal year of a company may be greater or  lesser than a period of 12 months.


This may happen when a company changes its fiscal year.


{:.example}
A company's original fiscal year was from April 2000 -  March 2001. If the company wants to adopt the calendar year as its fiscal  year, beginning January 1, 2001, the fiscal year from April 2000 - December  2000 would be less than 12 months.


<font color="#000000" class="hcp1">If the company's fiscal year is January - December 
 2000 and from 2001, it wants to adopt April - March as its fiscal year, 
 the fiscal year 2000 would be extended by 3 months, to March 2001.</font>
