# Document Information


**Loc/Sub-Loc**
: This field identifies the location or sub-location  for which the document is being created. It is the location or sub-location  that initiates the stock transfer. When a new stock transfer is created,  the **loc/Sub-Loc** field displays  the login location/sub-location,  but a different location or sub-location can be specified for the document.
: By assigning a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of stock transfers by sub-location and print reports  for your management information purposes.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  can group all stock transfers in the **Stock 
 Transfers** browser by sub-location to find out the total stock transfers  initiated by the **Mail Order** **Location/Sub-Location**.

**Document #**
: When you save a document, **Everest**  automatically generates the document number. The document number is the  next number in sequence for stock transfer documents for the login  location or the location of the logged in location/sub-location.
: If sequence numbers are not defined for the login  location or sub-location, the document uses the sequence number assigned  to the default location (path: **File &gt; 
 Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** field).


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  1256 is the next number in sequence for stock transfers for the login  location/sub-location ‘Mail Order’,  then 1256 is assigned to a new stock transfer document created for the  location/sub-location‘Mail Order’.

{:.note}
Stock transfer document numbers are listed under **ST** # column in the **Stock 
 Transfers** browser.


**Document Notes**
: Notes can be attached to keep track of important  messages or information pertaining to the document.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You can  attach a note giving details of the requisition for the stock transfer.
: The document note does not get printed with the  document. It is used primarily for communication between users within  the company.


**Document Date**
: The date of a stock transfer document is the date  of creation of that document. The document date, by default, is your login  date. You cannot change the date on the document. To create documents  with a different date, you must login  with a different date.
