# Tracking Stock-in-Transit


Stock-in-transit are stocks that are being moved from one  stock area to the other. To track a stock-in-transit, create a stock transfer  document to transfer stocks to an **In 
 Transit** stock area when the items are shipped. When the items are  received at the destination, transfer the items from the **In 
 Transit** stock area to the destination stock area.


A company that has to transfer stock across locations can  track stock that is In transit through the stock transfer profile (Select  **Options** > **New 
 Request** > **In New Window**  from the Stock Transfer profile).
