# Retrieving Discontinued Item(s)  into Inventory Adjustment Documents


**Everest** allows you to retrieve  discontinued item(s)  in to the Inventory Adjustment documents. In such cases you need not reactivate  the item for retrieval; you can directly call those items into the document.


**Retrieving Discontinued  Item(s)**


{:.steps}
To retrieve discontinued item(s),  do the following:

- From the **Inventory Adjustment** document, select  **Options &gt; Item &gt; Select Items**.  You will see the **Items** browser.
- From the **Items** browser menu, select **View 
 &gt; Discontinued**. You will see all the discontinued items displayed  in the browser with an ‘X’ mark on the top left corner of the icon![wh_discontinued_item.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/wh_discontinued_item.gif).
- Select the  discontinued item that you want to retrieve and click **OK**.  You will be prompted whether you want to retrieve the item. Click **Yes** and proceed.



{:.note}
In case you are retrieving multiple items of which some  are discontinued, you will be prompted whether to retrieve only active  items or both active and discontinued items. Select according to your  requirement; click **OK**, and proceed.


This is applicable also in case you are retrieving a  kit having any component item(s)  with the status ‘discontinued’.
