# Process - Block for Counting


The **Block for Counting** option  initializes the counting process. When you select this option, the item  quantities retrieved into the Stock Count document CANNOT be received/committed/shipped  till the stock count document is marked as **Complete**.


{:.warn}
**Everest**  warns you that if you select the **Block 
 for** **Counting** option, no  transaction would be permitted for the bins selected for counting till  the counting is complete. You may choose to continue or abort the process.


The count status changes to **Counting 
 in Process - Blocked**. While the **Stock 
 Count** profile is in this stage, you cannot attach or ship items  retrieved in this document from the selected bins, until the count is  finalized and the inventory adjustments are made.
