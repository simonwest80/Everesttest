# Lot Number and Others


**Lot**
: You can search for serialized/auto-serialized items  by lot numbers. You can perform a search by using partial parameter values  in this field.
: ![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you do not know the exact number, you can enter the first digit, and in  that case, all the items which have lot numbers beginning with that digit  are displayed by the search.
: The drop-down button provided along with the **Lot Number** field is used to view history  of search parameters specified earlier.


Stock area


**In Area and Out Area**
: You can search for serial numbers of items by **In** stock area or **Out**  stock area.


{:.note}
**In** and **Out** stock areas override the stock areas  selected in the Current stock area option.


**Number of records to retrieve**
: This is used to specify the number of records to  be displayed in the browser, when you carry out a search.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  you choose 10, the search will retrieve all the records matching the parameters  set, but will display only 10 records at a time.


This option is common to all Find filters in **Everest**.
