# Process - Retrieve Items


To begin the process of counting stock, you need to draw items into  the **Stock Count** profile. You can  do this by using the **Retrieve Items**  option. The **Retrieve Items** option  provides three ways of retrieving items for which you want to count the  stock.

- **All**  – Choose this option to bring all the items i.e. the number of items multiplied  by the number of bins selected into the **Item 
 Details** grid of the **Stock Count**  profile. For instance, if you have 2 items and 3 stock bins, you will  see 2\*3=6 records in the **Item Details**  grid irrespective of the stock availability in the bins.
- **Find 
 Items** – Choose this option to filter items based on specific parameters  in the **Find Items** dialog box.

- **Import**  – You may have identified a list of items for which you want to conduct  a stock count. Using the **Import**  option, you can import these items into the **Stock 
 Count** profile. It is imperative that you save the **Stock 
 Count** profile prior to importing items into it. If the **Stock 
 Count** profile already contains items and you import more items  into it, only those items or item-bin-lot combinations which are not present  in the document are imported. In other words, items are not duplicated  during the import process.

You can also manually enter items into the  **Stock Count** profile. To do this,  double-click in the **Item Code**  column of the Item Details Grid, and select the item from the drop-down  browser.
