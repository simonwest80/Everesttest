# Accounting Information


When an inventory adjustment document is created, **Everest** makes the relevant accounting entries in a General Journal for Inventory Adjustment. If the adjustment type is Price Protection, then **Everest** also makes an entry for debiting or crediting the Accounts Payable Control Account in a Purchase Journal.


The General Journal number of the Inventory Adjustment Journal, the transaction number in the journal, the Purchase Journal number and the transaction number in the Purchase Journal are displayed, when you save the document.
