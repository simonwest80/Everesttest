# Process - Take Snapshot to Count


The **Take Snapshot to Count** option  initializes the counting process. When you select this option, the item  quantities retrieved into the Stock Count document CAN be received/committed/shipped  even when the counting is in progress.


The count status changes to **Counting 
 in Process - Freezed**. After changing the status to **Counted**,  you cannot attach or ship the retrieved items from the bin selected in  this document, until the count is finalized and the inventory adjustments  are made. This implies that all transactions for the item-bin combination  are frozen between the **Counted**  and **Completed** statuses.


Since this option permits you to carry out transactions from the respective  bins up to the **Counting In Process**  status, the system stock is updated accordingly when you open this document  the next time.
