# Stock Groups and Stock Areas


Stock groups and stock areas in **Everest**  extend beyond physical locations. They can be created to represent physical  locations (e.g., Warehouse - New Jersey) or virtual locations (e.g., Stocks-in-transit).  A stock area is a bin in which the items are actually located.


The type of stock area identifies whether the stock type is **Stock**  or **Out** and whether you have ownership  over the stocks in that area. The type **Stock**  denotes that you own the inventory in the stock area. The type **Out**  denotes that the ownership of the inventory vests with another.


Tracking stocks with other entities is required to track your inventories.

**Everest** allows you to create  multiple levels of stock groups. Thus, stock groups can be created to  represent locations (Virginia, Ohio), warehouses ('Warehouse 1 - Virginia’),  warehouse areas (‘Floor 2 -Warehouse 1 - Virginia’),  nature of stock in that area (‘Packing Area’),  ownership (‘Customer Returns Expected’,  ‘Items for inspection’)  or a combination of these.
