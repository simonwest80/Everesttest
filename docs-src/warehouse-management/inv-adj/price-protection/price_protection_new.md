# Price Protection


Price protection adjustments are made either to increase or decrease  inventory values of items in stock. The value of inventory items in stock  are increased when supplementary bills are received from a vendor and  are decreased when a vendor has to be debited for excess billing. The  item may be serialized, auto-serialized or non-serialized.


If you select the **Allow Users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in location** check box (path:  **File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General** tab), you can  only select items from the stock areas belonging to the logged in location.


Price protection is required in the following situations:

- **Accounting 
 for supplemental bills from vendors** - You may make adjustments  to the cost of an item in stock, if you get an additional bill from your  vendor for added costs on the item



**![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  receive 20 items at the cost of $150 per measure out of which 15 items  are sold. You get an additional bill for $40 for tax payable which is  $2 per item purchased. You must adjust the cost of the 5 items in stock  by $10 and expense the balance $30 towards sales tax of items not in stock.**

- **Corrections 
 in price** - You may make adjustments to costs, if the price was  entered incorrectly in the purchase receipt



**![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  the price of an item was incorrectly entered as $55 when it is actually  $50, then you must create a debit memo for the vendor for the excess and  reduce the value of that item in stock by $5.**
