# Accounting Entries for a Price Protection Document


Accounting entries for price protection are made in two journals - the  general journal to account for the adjustment in inventory value and the  purchase journal to account for the adjustment in account payable.


The following accounting entries are created when an adjustment for  price protection is made.

- [If  the total adjustment amount on the document is positive]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/misc/if_the_total_adjustment_amount_on_the_document_is_positive_pp.html)
- [If  the total adjustment amount on the document is negative]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/misc/if_the_total_adjustment_amount_on_the_document_is_negative_pp.html)



If the Inventory Adjustment accounts or Price Protection accounts differ  from line to item, then amounts are cumulated for each adjustment account.
