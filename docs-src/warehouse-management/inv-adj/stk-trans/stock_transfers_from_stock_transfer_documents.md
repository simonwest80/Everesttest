# Stock Transfer from a Stock Transfer Document


Stock area transfer normally takes place to correct demand and supply  imbalances within the company.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) An  item that is slow moving in a certain distribution center may be moved  to an area where it is in demand.


Stock area transfers may also be required to segregate old or damaged  stock, stocks to be exchanged or repaired and stocks nearing obsolescence  from the other stocks.
