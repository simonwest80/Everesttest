# Stock Transfer of Matrix Items


**Everest** creates items that belong  to a matrix as individual items. Individual items that belong to a matrix  can be transferred from one stock bin to another as you do for any other  items.


If you select the **Logged in Location**  option of the **Allow Users to access stock 
 bins of** field Â (path:  **File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General** tab), you can  only select items from the stock bins belonging to the logged in location.


In order to transfer multiple items in an item matrix, **Everest** provides you with a convenient interface.


If the matrix items are tracked for lots, then all matrix items to be  transferred must belong to the same lot. Only non-serialized items can  be transferred. Multiple stock transfer documents are created for each  matrix item transferred using this option.
