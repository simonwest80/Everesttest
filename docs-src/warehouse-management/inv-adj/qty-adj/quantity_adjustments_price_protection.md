# Quantity Adjustments


Quantity adjustments may be required, if the physical stock of an item  differs from the stocks as per **Everest**.  If the physical stock is more, the additional quantity has to be added  to the stock; if less, it has to be reduced from the stock. The item may  be serialized, auto-serialized or non-serialized. Quantity Adjustments  are of two types:

- **Add 
 Quantity** - If the physical stock of an item exceeds the stock as  per **Everest**, the excess quantity  in the physical stock has to be brought into **Everest**  by adding the quantity to the stock.
- **Write 
 off Quantity** - Physical stocks may have to be written off for reasons  such as obsolescence, breakage, spoilage, expiry  or loss.
