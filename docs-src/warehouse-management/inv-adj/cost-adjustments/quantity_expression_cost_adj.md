# Quantity Expression


Quantity is expressed in terms of the stock measure. When an item is  added to the document, the column displays a default quantity of 1.


The quantity entered in the **Quantity** column depends on the quantity entry method specified for the measure  in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory &gt; Items &gt; 
 Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Inventory** tab**)**.

If the quantity is 2 kilograms, 500 grams  and 15 milligrams, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed  as 2500.15 grams.
