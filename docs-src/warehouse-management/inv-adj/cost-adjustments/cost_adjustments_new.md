# Cost Adjustments


Cost adjustments to inventory may be done to increase or decrease the  value of an item in stock. The item may be serialized, auto-serialized  or non-serialized. If it is a serialized item, adjustments are made to  the cost of each item. If it is a non-serialized item, adjustments are  made to the average cost of the item.


Adjustments to inventory costs and value may be required for maintaining  sales margins where an item's selling price is calculated as a markup  on its cost. When the purchase cost of the item falls, you may adjust  the cost of the item to ensure that selling prices are maintained at earlier  levels.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  sell item 10256 at a 25% markup on cost. The item cost is usually $100  but on one consignment it drops to $80. In this case, to maintain prices  at $125 you must adjust the cost by $20.


Adjustments to inventory costs may also be required to restate inventory  values at current market rates.


![example.gif]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) If  there is a sudden drop in price of an item, then you may have to write  down the value of the item in stock.


If you select the **Allow Users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in location** check box (path:  **File &gt; Set up &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General** tab), you can  only select items from the stock areas belonging to the logged in location.
