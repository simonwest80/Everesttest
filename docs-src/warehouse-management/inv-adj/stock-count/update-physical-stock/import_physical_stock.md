Keep in mind the following instructions when  mapping fields in the **Field Mapping**  section of the Data Import Wizard.

- It is mandatory  to map only the **Item Code** field.
- If you map the  **Physical Count**, **Serial 
 Number** and **Manufacturerâ€™s Serial** number fields, it becomes mandatory to map the **Bin**  field.

- [Inventoried Items]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/misc/inventoried_items.html)
- [Inventoried  Items with Lots]({{site.wm_baseurl}}/misc/inventoried_items_with_lots.html)
