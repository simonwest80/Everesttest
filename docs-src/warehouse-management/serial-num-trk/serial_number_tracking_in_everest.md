# Serial Number Tracking in Everest


**Everest** allows you to create  two types of serialized items:

- Serialized
- Auto-serialized



Serialized items are individually tracked for costs, manufacturer's  serial numbers, vendors and stock movements.


Auto-serialized items are tracked using manufacturer's serial numbers  at the time of sale.

 Type</a></font>


Serial numbers are generated for both serialized and auto-serialized  items received against a purchase order, receipt, or invoice. Serial numbers  are also generated for assembly type of items when they are assembled  and taken into the stock of finished items. Serial numbers are generated  in a series that starts from the next serial number for the login  location/sub-location.

Serial number tracking involves tracking the following information for  each unit of an item:

- Manufacturer's  Serial Number.
- Lot number  of manufacture.
- The actual  cost of the unit.
- The vendor,  if the same item is sourced  from more than one vendor.
- The purchase  receipt or invoice of the serial number.
- The  actual profit margin on sale of the unit.
- The  current stock area.
- The history  of stock transfers for the unit with the dates when the unit was transferred  to another stock area and the document against which it was transferred.
- The Documentâ€™s  number - If the serial number is attached or committed against any purchase,  sales, debit or credit order.
