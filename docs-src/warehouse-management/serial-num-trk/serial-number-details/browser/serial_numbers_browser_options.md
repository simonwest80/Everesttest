# Serial Numbers Browser


The **Serial Numbers** browser (path:  **Inventory &gt; Serial Numbers**)  displays a list of serial numbers of both serialized and auto-serialized  items.


All options (path: **Serial Numbers**  browser > **Options**) available  in this browser are standard options common to all browsers in **Everest**  except the **Custom Field** and **Open Document** options.


**Custom Fields**
: The **Custom Fields** feature allows you to define additional information for any record  such as character strings, date fields, logical fields, memo or numeric  fields. You can set up custom fields for serial numbers using this option.


**Multimedia**
: The **Multimedia**  option allows you to attach images, sound, video, documents, spreadsheets,  and other files to a particular serial number. You can store these files  in the multimedia repository.
: When you select this option, the **Multimedia 
 Setup** browser is displayed, wherein you can also view the files  attached to the serial number record highlighted in the **Serial 
 Numbers** browser.


**Open Document**
: This option displays the document to which the serial  number selected is associated. Display of documents depends on **Generated 
 In** and **Assigned To** columns  of the **Serial Numbers** browser.
: You will see the **Purchase 
 Receipt** document from which the particular serial number has been  created, if you click the column **Generated 
 In** prior to selecting **Open Document**.  If you double-click the column **Assigned 
 To**, then the document displayed will be a sales order, sales invoice,  debit memo credit memo, debit order or credit order, or any of the inventory  adjustment documents.
