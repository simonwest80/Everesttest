You can specify multiple search parameters here, which also meet conditions  set for the search. This is a more complex option than the other parameter  tabs in the Find Filter, and is extremely useful to narrow down your search  to specific requirements.


To add conditions, select **Click here 
 to add condition** option of **Advanced 
 Find** field. This option allows you to specify conditions for serial  number, item code, purchase date etc.
