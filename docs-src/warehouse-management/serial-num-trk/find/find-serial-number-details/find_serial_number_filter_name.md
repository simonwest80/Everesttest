# Find Serial Number - Filter Name


The Filter Name is used to identify each filter that most closely describes  your search criterion. You can create as many filters for finding serial  numbers, with varying parameters and store them in **Everest**.  You can access these filters whenever you want to find information using  the parameters specified in those filters.

The drop-down button provided along with the **Filter 
 Name** field is used to view history of filters used earlier.


You can use the browse button to look for the filters you have specified  earlier.


The browse button will take you to the **Select 
 Filter** browser, which lists all the stored filters by the Filter  Name and Filter ID. When you choose a filter from the browser, the **Find Serial Number** dialog box gets populated  automatically with all the parameters specified for that filter. You can  modify or add to the existing parameters.


You can define as many filters as you want using the various parameters  explained below. The parameters can be chosen individually or in combination  with other parameters when you want to narrow down your search.
