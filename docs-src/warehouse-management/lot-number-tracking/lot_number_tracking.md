# Lot Number Tracking


Items that are mass-produced are manufactured in lots or batches. Manufacturers  assign unique lot numbers or batch numbers and affix them on all quantities  manufactured in that lot or batch. Lot numbers are generally assigned  to items that are not assigned individual manufacturer's serial numbers.

Lot numbers may also be assigned to items with serial numbers to identify  the batch in which the item was manufactured.


Lot number tracking involves maintaining the following information:

- The batch number  or lot number of manufacture for quantities of an item on purchase or  manufacture.

- Lot numbers  of quantities sold or utilized.

- Lot  numbers of quantities in stock and their location.
