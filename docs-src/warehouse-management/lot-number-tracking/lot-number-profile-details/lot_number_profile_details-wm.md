# Lot Number Profile 


The **Lot Number** profile (path: **Inventory** > **Lots** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Lot** profile)  allows you to track items based on the lot number of manufacture. You  can assign lot numbers in two ways - either by specifying its details  in the **Lot Number** profile or by  entering the lot numbers when items are received.


The Lot Number has to be specified Â in  the **Assign quantity** dialog box  when items are received. Lot numbers must be unique for each item. If  you have already created lot numbers, you can assign them to the items  when they are received.


The Lot Numbers are displayed in the **Item 
 Stock Status** dialog box.
