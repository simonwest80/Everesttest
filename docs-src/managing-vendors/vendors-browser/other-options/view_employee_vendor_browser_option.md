# View Employee


Use this option to view the employees who are set up as vendors in the  **Vendors** browser. When a vendor  code is associated with an employee in **US 
 Payroll** in the **Employee** profile  (path: **Accounting &gt; US** **Payroll** > **Employees**  > **Employee** **Data**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Vendor for take home pay** field), **Everest** treats that vendor as an ‘employee  vendor’.


{:.hint}
You can identify an employee record by grouping  the **Vendors** browser by the **Employee** field. To view this field,  drag and drop it (path: **Vendors**  browser > **Field Chooser &gt; Customize**  window) into the **Vendors** browser.
