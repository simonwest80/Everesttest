# Document Policy


Use the **Document Policy** tab  to assign the company’s purchase policies. Document policies refer to  the vendor's policies on purchases, or the company's policies for purchase  orders issued to a vendor.


![]({{site.mv_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  Your  company's policy for Purchase Orders is; ‘The Purchase Order is valid  for a period of two weeks from the date of the order’.  The vendor ABC Inc.  may follow another policy; ‘The Purchase Order is valid for four weeks’.


You can specify a different policy for each purchase document type.  If the policy on any purchase document for a vendor differs from the company's  general policy, you must specify it in this tab. This is the default policy  applicable for the relevant purchase document for the vendor. You can  edit the document policy for individual documents from the document profile.
