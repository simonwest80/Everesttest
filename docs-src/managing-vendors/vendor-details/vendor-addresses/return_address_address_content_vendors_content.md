# Return Address


The vendor's return addresses are the various addresses to which vendor  returns are shipped. You can define:

- Multiple return  addresses for a vendor.
- A default vendor  return address to which you normally ship vendor returns.
- A different  return address at the time of creating a purchase return document for  the vendor.



You can also set up the billing address as the return address. Freight  on returns is calculated based on the return address.


{:.note}
The list of return addresses must also include  the addresses to which vendors must ship items. This could be the address  of any of your warehouses or offices. You can select these addresses in  purchase quotes, orders, receipts, and invoices as the Ship To address.


{:.hint}
We recommend that you set up all the addresses  where you receive items as return addresses for at least one vendor.
