# Zip/Postal Code/US FIPS


To help in processing and easy delivery of mail, postal authorities  divide a country into areas and identify each area by means of a unique  **Postal Code**. The **Zip/Postal 
 Code** identifies the area in which the address is located.


In addition to zip codes, the United States Postal Services also use  the **Federal Information Processing Standards**  (FIPS) codes. They are a combination of the state, county and city codes.  A FIPS code uniquely identifies a location, if a zip code is applicable  to more than one city or county.


{:.note}
**Everest** automatically populates  the **City** and **State**/**Province** fields for United States, if  you select a zip/postal code for the United States from the drop-down  list.


If the country selected is United States:

- You can specify  (select/modify/create) zip<font style="color: #0000ff;" color="#0000FF"> </font>codes.
- The button **US Fips**  is displayed.
