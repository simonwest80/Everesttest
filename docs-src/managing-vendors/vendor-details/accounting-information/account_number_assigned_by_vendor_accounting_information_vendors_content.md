# Account Number Assigned by Vendor


The **Account Number** **assigned 
 by Vendor** may contain any type of character but may not exceed  20 characters. The number helps identify a particular account when you  have more than one account with the vendor and also when reconciling the  vendor's statement of your account. This number, if available, appears  on all check stubs you print for the vendor for this account that do not  include "Date Printed" details.
