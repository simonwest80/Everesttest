# Discontinue a Vendor


When you discontinue a record it is not deleted from the database; it  is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available for  selection by activating it.


{:.note}
A vendor **cannot** be discontinued  if the vendor's net balance is not zero.


**Everest** informs you if the vendor  you are discontinuing has open orders. If you discontinue such a vendor,  you cannot make deposits against the purchase order, or convert it to  a purchase receipt or invoice.


{:.steps}
To discontinue  a vendor, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Purchasing** >  **Vendors**. You will see the **Vendors** browser.
- From the **Vendors** browser, highlight the **Vendor** record that has to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  You will see the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK**. The highlighted record will no longer  be displayed in the **Vendors** browser.
