Aging Period


The aging analysis is displayed for the outstanding amounts based on  the total days outstanding. The number of days for which a document is  outstanding is calculated from the document's due date.


The default time blocks for the aging analysis are 1-30 days, 31-60  days, 61-90 days, and greater than 90 days. You can change these time  blocks by clicking **Options** >  **Aging Options**.

You cannot modify the credit hold status from  here. You can change it manually only from the **Vendor** profile.
