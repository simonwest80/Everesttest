title: Posting Account Preferences (Vendor - Dropdown)
---


Specify an account selection methodology to be used for the  **Vendor** profile. You can specify  accounts without setting up posting groups. If you prefer to use posting  groups (groups of accounts), instead of making individual account selections,  that option is also available.

- **Use 
 Accounts Based Upon Hierarchy** – Select this option if you would  like the system to use vendor control accounts at the location level first  (if defined) and then at the company level (accounting defaults).
- **Use 
 Posting Groups** – Select this option if you would like to use Posting  Groups to define your accounts. If you select this option, you must enter  a “Vendor Posting Group” in the **Posting 
 Group** field that appears when you make this selection.
- **Specify 
 Accounts** – Select this option if you would like to specify the  vendor control accounts to use for this Vendor. Click the ![]({{site.mv_baseurl}}/img/look_up_button_mv.gif)  lookup  button to view the related accounts that can be defined (see the following  figure). On the **Accounts** screen,  select the **Vendor Control** **Accounts** that you would like to define  for this Vendor. Click **Apply** and  then click **OK** to apply your selections.
