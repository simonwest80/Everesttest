title: Allow Back Orders
---


Check this box if partial shipments are allowed on purchase orders.  If the **Allow Back Orders** check  box is selected, the **Allow Back Orders**  check box on the **Purchase Order**  profile is selected by default. You can change this option at the document  level.


If you do not select this check box, the entire order has to be converted  to a receipt or invoice; there cannot be partial shipments. If you try  to make a partial shipment, the purchase receipt or invoice is NOT saved.  **Everest** prompts you that partial  shipment of items are not allowed.


This option is applicable only at the time of conversion of purchase  order into purchase receipt or invoice.
