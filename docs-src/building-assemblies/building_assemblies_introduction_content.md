# Building Assemblies


Business activity is traditionally classified into manufacturing, retail  sales, wholesale trading, distribution and services. The assembly function  in **Everest** caters to the needs  of organizations whose manufacturing activity involves any of the following:

- Assembling  components to produce finished goods.

- Execution of  job orders based on customer’s specifications for the finished goods.

- Adding value  to raw materials or semi-finished goods to produce finished items.

Although the assembly function addresses the needs of most manufacturing  units, the specialized requirements of the following types of manufacturing  units are beyond the scope of this function:

- Process industries  that require the output of one process to automatically become the input  of another.

- Manufacturing  that takes place in distinct identifiable and continuous stages where  each stage has separate standards for input, output, joint products, and  by-products.

- Continuous  manufacturing where the variable costs of production need to be automatically  computed based on parameters other than output. **Everest**  can track a cost that is linked to the final output such as raw material  cost, but it is not designed to track indirect variable costs that are  linked to other production parameters.
