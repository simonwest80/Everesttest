# Variance Analysis


Variance is the difference between standard costs and actual costs.  Variance analysis identifies whether the variance is because of a change  in rate or quantity or mix. Variance analysis helps to control costs;  it allows you to focus on the areas of concern.


![]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â An  adverse variance of over 15% in cost of an important material would allow  you to focus on controlling costs of that material.


Variances in production are calculated using the standard costs and  quantities specified in the Bill Of Material for the assembly.


Variances may be classified into the following:

- [Rate  Variance]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/variance-analysis/rate_variance_variance_analysis_work_order_assembly_content.html)
- [Quantity  Variance]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/variance-analysis/quantity_variance_variance_analysis_work_order_assembly_contents.html)
- [Cost  Variance]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/variance-analysis/cost_variance_variance_analysis_work_order_assembly_contents.html)
- [Variance  Analysis - Substitute Item]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/variance-analysis/variance_analysis_substitute_items.html)



{:.steps}
To view the variance analysis for a work  order, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Inventory** >  **Bill of Material** > **Work****Order**. You will see the **Work Orders** browser.
- From the **Work Orders** browser, double-click the  required record. You will see the **Work 
 Order** profile.
- From the **Work Order** profile, select **Options**  > **Variance Analysis**. You will  see the [**Variance Analysis**]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/variance-analysis/variance_analysis_dialog_box_work_order_assembly.html) dialog box.



{:.note}
You can also view the **Variance 
 Analysis** dialog box by highlighting the required record in the  **Work Orders** browser and selecting  **Options** > **Variance 
 Analysis**.
