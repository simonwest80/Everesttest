# Delete Items from a Work Order


You cannot delete items that are part of the **** Bill Of Material **** (path:  **Inventory** > **Items** > **Options** >  **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Assembly**  > **Input** tab) from the work  order as they are required for calculating variances.


You can only delete items that you have added and that do not belong  to the Bill Of Material. Further, you can delete non-inventoried items,  provided you have not entered any values in the **Actual 
 Input** column.

 Process**).
