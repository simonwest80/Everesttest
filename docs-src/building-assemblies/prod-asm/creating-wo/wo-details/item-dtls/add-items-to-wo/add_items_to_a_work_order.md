# Add Items to a Work Order


You can add entirely new items to the work order or a substitute for  an item that is retrieved when the Assembly item is selected.


{:.note}
You can add items in the stock measure only.  You cannot change the unit of measure.


**Inventoried Items**


You can commit and detach the committed inventoried items until the  **In Process** stage. Once you select  the **In Process** option (path: **Work Order** profile > **Options** > **Process** > **In Process**), you cannot add inventoried  items to the work order.


**Non-inventoried Items**


You can add non-inventoried items to the work order until the **Build** stage. Once you select the **Build** option (path: **Work 
 Order** profile > **Options**  > **Process** > **Build**),  you cannot add inventoried items to the work order.


You can add new items to the work order. Such items can be an entirely  new item or a substitute for an item that is retrieved when the Assembly  item is selected (in the **Assembly** field).
