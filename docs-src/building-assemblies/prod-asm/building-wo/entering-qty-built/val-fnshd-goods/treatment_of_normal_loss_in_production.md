# Treatment of Normal Loss in Production


Normal loss is the quantity of the item that is generally lost during  the assembly process.


**![]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â You  require 100 units of an item. If there is usually a loss of 9% on the  original input, you would have to use 110 units of the input item. The  loss of 10 units during production is called normal loss.**


The standard input and normal loss for the assembly is defined in the  Bill Of Material in the **Item** (Assembly)  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Items** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Assembly**  > **Input** tab).


The actual input entered in the work order must also account for the  normal loss.


The cost of normal loss is built into the cost of production.
