# Treatment of Abnormal Loss/Gain in Production


Abnormal loss is the excess of required output over actual output.


An Abnormal gain is an unexpected surplus of output if the actual loss  is less than anticipated.


Abnormal loss/gain is calculated by the following formula:


(Estimated input for actual output - Actual input) \* Actual rate


If this is negative, then it is a loss, if positive, it is a gain.
