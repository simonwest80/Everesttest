# Transfer of Finished Goods


Finished goods built can be transferred or distributed to various stock  areas from the **Work Order** profile.  They are initially added to the default stock area for finished goods  but can be assigned to other stock areas using the [**Assign Quantity** dialog box]({{site.ba_baseurl}}/prod-asm/building-wo/entering-qty-built/trans-fnshd-goods/assign_quantity_profile.html).
