# Cost of Work In Process


The cost of work-in-process is computed differently for serialized and  non-serialized items.


Serialized Items


The cost of work-in-process for serialized items is the sum of the actual  cost of each serial number attached to the work order.


Non-serialized items


The cost of work in process for non-serialized inventoried items is  computed using the following formula:


Quantity attached to work order \* Average Cost of the item at the time  of setting the work order status to In Process.


{:.note}
The cost of non-inventoried items is not included  when calculating the cost of the work-in-process.
