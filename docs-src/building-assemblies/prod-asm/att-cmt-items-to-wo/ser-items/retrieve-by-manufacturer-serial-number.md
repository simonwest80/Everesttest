- Specify the  manufacturer's serial number of the item in the **Manufacturer’s 
 Serial #** field and click **Apply**.

In case the manufacturer’s serial number is assigned to more than one  serial number, when the item is retrieved into the document using the  manufacturer’s serial number the **Serial 
 Numbers** browser is displayed. This browser displays a list of serial  numbers that bear the same manufacturer serial number. Select the required  serial number from this browser.
