**Created By**
: This field displays the name of the logged in user  by default. This is a display field and cannot be edited.

**Main Order #**
: **Everest**  allows you to process work orders in parts if you do not want to build  the entire required output during one assembly run.
: When the first batch is assembled, **Everest** creates another work order to account for the remaining quantity  to be built. For the newly created work order, the main order is the original  work order based on which the current one is created.

You create Work Order  # 10000 to build these 10 computers. When the next work order (work order  # 10020) is created for another 50 computers, work order # 10000 is itâ€™s  main order.


**Back Order**
: If work orders are processed in parts, the work  order that is created based on the current work order is called the Back  Order.
