# Account Summary


The **Account Summary** option (path:  **Customer** profile > **Options**  > **History** > **Account Summary**) displays a summary of your transactions with the  selected customer. By default all amounts are displayed in the base currency.


The customer summary is updated whenever a sales invoice, or credit  memo (either manual or system) is created for the customer or whenever  payment is received or refund made to the customer.
