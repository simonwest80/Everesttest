# Prepayments


**Pre-payments** refer to full payments  made before the items are delivered.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â If  items are delivered to customers only after the credit card payment is  approved, check this box.


If the customer is allowed prepay terms, credit cards can be set up  for the customer that can be used to process payments.


Since the default POS customer is presumed to pay for items purchased  over the counter, the **Allow Prepay Purchases**  option is disabled.
