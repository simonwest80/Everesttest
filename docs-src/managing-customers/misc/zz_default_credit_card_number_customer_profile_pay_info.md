title: Default Credit Card Number
---


Specify the default credit card number of the customer. Credit card  numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).


Click the **Add New Credit Card Details** lookup button beside this field to display the **Credit 
 Cards** browser. Here, you can view credit card details for the customer.


{:.note}
Only users with adequate security rights can access the **Credit 
 Cards** browser and **Credit Card** profile.


The **Add New Credit Card Details** lookup  button ![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/managing_customers_lookup_button.gif) is disabled if the **Automatically 
 Save Credit Card to Account** option is unchecked.


You can set up credit cards for a new customer, and save the details,  before you save the profile. Customer details such as account name and  the first name or the last name are however, mandatory.


If you decide not to create the customer, after specifying and saving  credit card details for this customer, these details are purged, and are  not available to any user.


You can discontinue a credit card even if it is set as the default for  the customer.
