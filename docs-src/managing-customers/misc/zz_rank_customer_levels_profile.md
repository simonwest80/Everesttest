This field displays the rank assigned to the customer level by **Everest**. You cannot edit this field.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â **Everest** sequentially assigns a numeric  rank to each customer level that you create. You can arrange the columns  in the **Customer Levels** browser  in any order, and thereby manage a large number of levels. The **Level** is displayed only after you save the **Customer 
 Levels** profile.
