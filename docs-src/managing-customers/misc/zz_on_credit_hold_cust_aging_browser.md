title: On Credit Hold
---


The **On credit hold** check box  displays the credit hold status of the customer. This check box will be  checked if you have put the customer on credit hold.


This check box is checked by default, if the **On 
 credit hold** check box in the **Customer** profile is selected (path: **Invoicing 
 &gt; Customers &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment information tab**).


**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â You  cannot modify the credit hold status from here. You can change it manually  from the **Customer** profile.**
