# Discontinue a Customer


When you discontinue a record it is not deleted from the database; it  is merely deactivated. A discontinued record can be made available for  selection by activating it.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  You  can discontinue a customer only if the customer’s net balance is zero.


**Everest**  informs you if the customer you are discontinuing has open orders. If  you discontinue such a customer, you cannot accept deposits against the  sales order, or convert the sales order to a sales invoice.


{:.steps}
To discontinue a customer, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Customers**.  You will see the **Customers** browser.
- From the **Customers** browser, highlight the customer  record to be discontinued.
- Select **Options** > **Discontinue**.  You will see the **Confirm** window.
- Click **OK**. The selected record is no longer  visible in the **Customers** browser.
