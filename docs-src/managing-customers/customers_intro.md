# Customers


Customers include all entities to whom you sell or propose to sell your  products or services. You need to set up customers to:

- Track sales  opportunities for customers and customer prospects.
- Accept sales  orders.
- Accept customer  deposits.
- Bill a customer  for sales made.
- Manage tasks  and appointments for the customer or prospective customers.



**You have to set up a customer account for:**

1. Each customer  account that has to be maintained.



![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you sell to two branches of the same company and want to track the details  of sale of each branch, you have to set up an account for each branch.

1. Each currency  in which you invoice the same customer.



**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you sell to two branches of ABC Inc.,  in France and in U.K.,  you must set up two accounts; one with currency as Euro  and the other as British Pound Sterling.**


However, two accounts are not required in  a situation where you always invoice the customer in a single currency  but receive payments in any currency.


**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  If  you always invoice ABC Inc.  in Euro, but  receive payments in either Euro  or British Pound Sterling, you do not require two accounts.**

1. Each customer  prospect. To create sales opportunities for or track tasks associated  with the prospect.
- Every vendor  that you sell to. If you sell to and buy from the same entity, you must  set up a separate customer and vendor account.



How you set up your customer database is critical to your sales function.  Besides billing and shipping information, the details specified in the  customer's profile determine:

1. The price at  which you sell an item to a customer.
- Discounts that  the customer is eligible for.
- Payment terms  allowed to the customer.
- Sales tax charged  on sales to the customer.
- Management  of the customer's credit limit.
- The customer's  access to your **Everest** online  store shop.
