# Zip/Postal Code/US FIPS


To help in processing and easy delivery of mail, postal authorities  divide a country into areas and identify each area by means of a unique  **Postal Code**. The **Zip/Postal 
 Code** field identifies the area in which the address is located.


In addition to zip codes, the United States Postal Services also use  the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)  codes. They are a combination of the state, county and city codes. A FIPS  code uniquely identifies a location, if a zip code is applicable to more  than one city or county.
