# Account Code


The account code uniquely identifies a customer's account. When you  create a company, a default point of sale customer with code POS\_Cust  is automatically created.


The customer code is automatically generated, if left blank. In this  case, the code generated is the next number in sequence, specified for  the logged in location/sub-location. The sequence numbers are specified  in the **Customer** field of the **Location** profile (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Location/Sub-Location** >  **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Invoicing** tab).


If a sequence number is not assigned to the logged in location/sub-location,  the sequence number of the default location (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults &gt; Accounting &gt; Miscellaneous** tab **&gt; Default Location** <font style="color: #000000;" color="#000000">field) is used.</font>


The account code can be used by the customer to log into your **Everest eStorefront** store.
