# Address


The address of the customer is the billing address. It is the address  to which you send invoices. A customer can have only one billing address,  but may have any number of return and contact addresses.


{:.note}
**If the customer’s billing address is used  when creating final documents (such as sales invoices or credit memos),  you can modify the billing address by using the ‘**Modify 
 Address**’  option in the **Customer** profile.**


**When you modify a customer’s billing address,  **Everest** allows you to:**

- Modify the original  address and retain the original address on the documents in which it is  used. The new address is used only on new documents created for the customer.
- Specify a new billing  address, and discontinue the original address. The new address replaces  all occurrences of the original address.
