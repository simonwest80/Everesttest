# Payment Term Applicable


The payment term that applies to the customer is the basis for calculating  the due date for payments on sales, and cash discounts for prompt payments.  A payment term must be selected (in the **Term** field) only if the customer is allowed to make purchases on account.  Only ‘on account’  type of payment terms are available for selection.

The **Terms** selected in the **Customers** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Customers**)  is displayed, by default, in the **Terms**  field of the **Customer** profile  (path: **Customer** profile > **Payment** **Information**  tab).

When you create a document for the customer, the payment terms defined  in the **Payment Terms** field of  the **Customer** profile (path: **Customer** profile > **Payment 
 Information** tab) is displayed, by default, in the **Terms** field (of the document profile).
