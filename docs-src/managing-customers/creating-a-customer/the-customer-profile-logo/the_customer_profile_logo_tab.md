# The Customer Profile – Logo


This tab allows you to attach a bitmap  (.bmp) image  of the customer's business logo. This logo is used when printing packing  slips specifically for a blind shipment of goods on behalf of the customer.


**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  The  **Blind Ship** option allows you to  drop ship items to your customer’s customer. Details of the actual vendor  are not printed on the packing slips (in the **Blind 
 Ship** format), sent with the goods.**


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/example.gif)  A  customer (A) who buys goods from you could be a retail vendor, with his  own customers (B, C  and D). If customer (A) does not have sufficient stocks to fulfil  the sales orders of customers (B, C  and D), he can request you to deliver the goods, as a blind shipment.  You will ship the goods to customers (B, C  and D), with either the address or logo of customer (A) printed on the  packing slips. When customers (B, C  and D) receive the goods, they are unaware of the origin of the shipment.  You can raise a normal sales invoice on customer (A) and the acknowledged  copy of the packing slip must be attached as proof of delivery.


**![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif)  The  recommended size for the bitmap  is 5.0 x 1.4 inches. Only file formats of the type .bmp  are supported. The recommended file size of the logo is less than 1 MB.  If the file size exceeds 1 MB, the performance  of report printing job may be affected because the logo must be copied  to the local workstation for each print job. However sub-locations  cannot have separate logos.**

- Click the look  up button beside **Image**. You will  see the **Open** dialog box.
- Select the  required logo bitmap  (.bmp) file  and click **Open**. The logo appears  in the display area.
