{:.steps}
To create an address, do the following:

- Click the ![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/managing_customers_profile_option_new.gif) button from the shipping or contact address section. **Everest** displays the **Confirm**  window. You can indicate whether or not the new contact/shipping address  must be the same as the customerâ€™s billing address.
- Click **Yes** to automatically update the fields  (other than the **Mobile/Cell**, **Pager** and **Web 
 URL** fields) in the **General**  tab of the **Address**  profile with the corresponding data entered in the **General** tab of the **Customer** profile.
- Click **No** to update only the **Company** and **Country** fields in the  **Address** profile with the corresponding  data entered in the **General** tab  of the **Customer** profile.
