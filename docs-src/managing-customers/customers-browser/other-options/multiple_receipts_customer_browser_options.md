# Multiple Receipts


This option displays the **Multiple Receipt 
 Wizard** that enables you to receive multiple payments from customers,  and make refunds, without having to make individual payments in the receipt  journal or from within documents.


![]({{site.mc_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) Â From  the **Customers** browser, you can  select multiple customers, from whom you want to receive payments. You  do not need to specify **Receipt Journal 
 Information** and **Document Criteria** such as **Payment Terms** and  **Document Aliases** in the **Multiple Receipts Wizard**. These fields are automatically populated  with the selected customers information.
