# Items Sales/Returns


Use the **Item Sales/Returns** option  (path: **Customers** browser >  **Options** > **History 
 &gt; Item Sales/Returns &gt; &lt;document name&gt;**) to view the  sales or sales return documents created for the selected customer. Select  this option to view the **Item Sales History**  browser for the selected document type. By default, this browser is grouped  by the items contained in the document.


The items' sales/return history is useful to obtain the total quantities  of items ordered, sold, or returned by a customer.


The **Item Sales History** browser  displays all the items included in the selected document type (sales quotes,  orders, and invoices, credit quotes, orders, and memos) and lists all  the documents in which the item is found. Details such as the document  number, item description, quantity, and price, document date, amount of  discount, and tax code are listed.
