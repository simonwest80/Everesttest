# Component Palette


The Component Palette displays window controls that can be added to  the target form. If the controls are in the existing form, they are usually  moved using the Field Chooser.


The following are examples of controls that can be added. These controls  are not a part of the non-customized form:

- **Picture Control**  - Adds a picture to the form
- **Static Label 
 Control** - Adds static text to the form



{:.example}
It adds additional text to a picture or adds  help information to the screen.

- **Group Box**  - Puts a box around items on the form
- **Panel**  - Puts a raised area around items on the form



{:.hint}
To move groups of fields easily around a form,  put the fields in a panel. A panel can also be placed in a group box.

- **Page Control** - Adds a new tab to the form



Interactive controls, which capture and change data, cannot be added  using the Component Palette.
