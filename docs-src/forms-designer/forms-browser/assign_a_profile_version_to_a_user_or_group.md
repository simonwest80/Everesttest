# Assign a Profile Version to a User or Group


Once a profile form version is saved, it can be assigned to a User or  Group. When a user logs in, the profile assigned to the user is displayed.  User assignments take precedence over group assignments. The standard  version of each customizable profile is assigned to users and groups by  default if no assignments are made.


{:.note}
: Each user can only have one version of a profile  active at one time.


{:.warn}
: Users with Forms Designer security rights should  only be assigned to standard profiles so that all options are available  to them.
