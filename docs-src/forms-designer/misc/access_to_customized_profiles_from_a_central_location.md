# Access to Customized Profiles from a Central Location


The **Forms** browser is used to  view and manage profile versions but not all users can open the **Forms** browser. The **Forms**  browser can only be opened by a user with the **View**  security right. This gives the user the ability to open and view the **Forms** browser only.


Additional rights are needed to create, assign, rename, purge, import  and export profile versions. The **Forms**  browser security rights are listed in the following table:


| Security Right | Path Activated |
| Form Browser: View | File > Setup > Forms |
| Form: Rename | Forms Browser > Options > Rename |
| Form: Purge | Forms Browser > Options > Purge |
| Forms Browser: Export | Forms Browser > Options > Export Forms |
| Forms Browser: Import | Forms Browser > Options > Import Forms |
| Forms Browser: Set Default Form | Forms Browser > Options > Set as Default |



If users try to open the **Forms**  browser without the associated security rights, the **Forms**  browser will not open and they will receive a security message.
