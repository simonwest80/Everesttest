# Add the Tasks Tab to the Customer Profile


When designing a Customer profile form, you can add the customer **Tasks** tab to show related tasks, calls,  and CRM Notes. It is not added to the target form by default.


{:.steps}
To add the dynamic Tasks tab to the Customer  profile, do the following:


• Click on the **Tasks** Tab Sheet  (Tab Sheet - Tasks) in the Field Chooser. You will see a **Target**  icon underneath your cursor.

**Targeted Drop Cursor**


• Click a location on the target form. The target icon is no longer  underneath your cursor and the dynamic customer **Tasks**  tab is added to the target form.


Because the customer **Tasks** tab  is a system dynamic tab, you cannot change the tab contents using the  Forms Designer.  You  are able to change the tab sheet properties, such as the name of the tab  and its position on the target Customer profile form.
