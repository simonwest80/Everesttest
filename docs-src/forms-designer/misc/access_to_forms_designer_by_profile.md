# Access to Forms Designer by Profile


Separate security rights are needed to create versions of each type  of profile. For example, a user can be assigned rights to only create  customized form versions for the Sales Quote, Sales Order, and the Sales  Invoice. The user would then be restricted from creating customized form  versions for the remaining customizable profiles.


Even though users have the Design item visible from the Options menu  in their profiles, only users with the **Design 
 Form** security right to the profile are able to open the Forms Designer  for that profile. The user with security rights to a profile can also  open the Forms Designer for that profile using the **Forms**  browser. Users without the appropriate security rights receive a security  message.


The profile security rights available and the paths that they activate  are listed in the following table:


| Security Right | Path Activated |
| Item: Design Profile Form | Item > Options > Design |
| Forms Browser > Design |
