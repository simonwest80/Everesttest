# Save the Target Form


Once you have completed the necessary design changes to the target form,  save it.


{:.steps}
To save the changes to a design, do the following:

- From the **Forms 
 Designer** menu, click **Designer**  > **Save**. The newly created form  is saved to the database.

- If the version has not been previously saved,  the **Save Form** dialog box appears  to allow you to enter a name for the newly created form.
- In the **Form Name**  field, enter a name for your form. The name must be unique for the versions  of this profile.



If the standard version is edited and saved, the changes are saved as  a new version. The standard version is then always available for use in  its default form.

- When finished, click **OK**.  The system validates the form for errors and displays a message box alerting  you to errors found.
- Correct any errors displayed and repeat the **Save** process.



You cannot save the new form until all errors are corrected. All mandatory  fields must be visible, enabled, and contained in the new form.


After you have corrected any errors and saved the newly designed form,  the form is available to be assigned to users and groups. The new form  does not become active until it is assigned.


Alternatively, you can select **Save 
 As** when saving your newly created form. Use **Save 
 As** if you want to give a version of the standard form a name or  if you want to save your current work as a previously saved version, replacing  the earlier version.
