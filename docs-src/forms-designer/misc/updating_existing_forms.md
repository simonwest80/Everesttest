# Updating Existing Forms


The **Everest** import utility can  be used to update existing form version definitions.  Importing  a form with the same name as the existing form will cause the existing  form version to be overwritten with the imported version.  To  do this, you must manually check the check box in the import forms browser  on a row with a name conflict condition.  When  you press the **Import** button, a  warning message will appear for each form version that will overwrite  an existing version.  You  must say “**YES**” to update the form.   Alternatively,  you may say “**YES TO ALL**”.
