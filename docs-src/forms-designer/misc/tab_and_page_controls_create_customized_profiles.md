# Tab and Page Controls


In Design mode, you can highlight fields and controls and change their  properties in the Object Inspector. Tab and Page “controls” can also be  selected so that you can change their properties.  A  **Tab Control** is a control for an  entire tab.  A  **Page Control** is a control for  the entire page which includes all of the tabs.  Both  controls are indicated by black dots. The Tab Control is used to add,  rename, reorder, and delete tabs.

It is important that you learn the difference between Tab Controls and  Page Controls because if you use the Page Control instead of the Tab Control  when working with tabs, you will not get the intended results.


{:.example}
If you want to select a tab to delete it,  select the Tab Control for that tab. If you select the Page Control by  mistake and press the **Delete** key,  all of the tabs will be deleted.
