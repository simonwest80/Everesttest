# Change the Tab Stop Order


{:.steps}
To change the order of the tab stops, do the following:

- Right click any object and select **Tab 
 Order** to change the order of the tab stops. The **Tab 
 Order** dialog box appears.
- Use the **Up**  and **Down** arrows to move the position  of the tab stops.
- When you have arranged the tab stops in the appropriate  order, click **OK**.



{:.note}
The **Tab Order**  mentioned here is the tab stop order.  This  is the order that the fields come into focus when the end user presses  the **Tab** key.  This  is different from the **Order of the Tabs**  which is the order in which the tabs are displayed.
