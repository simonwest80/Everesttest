# Save As Option


Use **Save As** if you want to give  a version of the standard form a name or if you want to save your current  work as a previously saved version, replacing the earlier version.


{:.steps}
To use Save As when saving your new form version, do the  following:

- From the Forms Designer menu, click **Designer**  > **Save As**. The **Save 
 Form As** dialog box displays the name of the form that was active  when the Forms Designer was opened, the name of the last form loaded,  or the name previously saved after the form was loaded.
- Enter a unique name for the form or select an  existing form to replace it with your current work.
- When finished, click **OK**.  The system validates the form for errors and displays a message box alerting  you to errors found.
- Correct any errors displayed and repeat the **Save As** process.
