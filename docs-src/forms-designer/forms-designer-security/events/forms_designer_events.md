# Forms Designer Events


In order to ensure that the Forms Designer functionality is used properly,  audit tracking is utilized to monitor activity. Management can then view  the Forms Designer events in a log. Events are logged by the system when  a profile version is created, modified, removed, or assigned. The following  specific events are logged:

- A profile form is created
- A profile form is modified
- A profile form is deleted
- A user is assigned to a form
- A group is assigned to a form



For each event logged, the particular profile version of the form is  also recorded.
