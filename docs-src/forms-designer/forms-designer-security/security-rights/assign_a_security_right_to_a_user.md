# Assign a Security Right to a User


Forms Designer security rights are added to users in the same way that  other security rights are assigned in **Everest**.


{:.steps}
To assign a Forms Designer security right to a user in Everest,  do the following:

- From the main menu bar, select **File**  > **Setup** > **Security 
 Rights**. The **Security Rights**  browser is displayed.
- Verify that the **Users**  tab is selected.
- In the **Left Panel**,  locate and highlight the Forms Designer security right to be assigned.
- On the **Users**  tab, in the **Users Not Assigned**  section, highlight the user to be assigned the selected security right  and click the ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/arrow to left.bmp) button to move the user's name to the **Users Assigned** section.
- Click **Save**  to save your changes and assign the selected security right to that user.



{:.note}
- You can also double-click  an item to move it from the **Users UnAssigned**  section to the **Users Assigned**  section without using the arrows.
- Forms Designer  security rights can similarly be assigned to groups of users using the  **Security Rights** browser â€“ **Groups** tab.
