# Remove a Security Right from a User


Forms Designer security rights are removed from users in the same way  that other security rights are removed in **Everest**.


{:.steps}
To remove an assigned Forms Designer security right from  a user in Everest, do the following:

- From the main menu bar, select **File**  > **Setup** > **Security 
 Rights**. The **Security Rights**  browser is displayed.
- Verify that the **Users**  tab is selected.
- In the **Left Panel**,  locate and highlight the Forms Designer security right to be removed.
- In the **Users 
 Assigned** section, highlight the user to have the selected security  right removed and click the ![]({{site.fd_baseurl}}/img/arrow to right.bmp) button to move the user's  name to the **Users Not Assigned**  section.
- Click **Save**  to save your changes and remove the selected security right from that  user.



{:.note}
- You can also double-click  an item to move it from the **Users Assigned**  section to the **Users Unassigned**  section without using the arrows.
- Forms Designer  security rights can similarly be removed from groups of users using the  **Security Rights** browser â€“ **Groups** tab.
