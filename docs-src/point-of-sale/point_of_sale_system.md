# Point of Sale System


The Point of Sale system in **Everest** is designed to integrate your inventory and accounting, while at  the same time, it provides you with a fast, user-friendly system for managing  Point of Sale counters.


The steps involved in using the Point of Sale system are as follows:

- [Set  up pole displays]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-setup/pole-display/setup/setting_up_a_pole_display.html), if required.
- [Set  up cash registers]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-setup/cash-registers/setup/setting_up_a_cash_register_pos_set_up.html) that involves setting up details for opening the  register, the opening code, the port, the pole display port and driver.  The setup also includes setting up default payment methods for receipts,  payments and change due, forms for printing Point of Sale receipts, allowing  for split payments in multiple currencies and change due against non-cash  payments.
- [Open  the cash register]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/using-cash-registers/opening_cash_register.html) to make it available for transactions.
- [Log  in to cash register]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/using-cash-registers/log_in_pos_cash_registers_browser_option.html) to create POS invoices and POS credit documents  to account for sales and returns.
- [Declare]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/using-cash-registers/declare_the_cash_register.html)  the cash register to reconcile the cash register contents with collections  as per the system.
