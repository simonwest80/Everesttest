# Due Date and Override 


The due date for payments of a document  is computed based on the payment term selected for the sale document.  The due date cannot be earlier than the document date. The due date is  calculated from the date of the invoice. You can change this date by selecting  the **Override** check box.

The due date for a sales quote or a sales order is not  relevant as the items have not been dispatched and payments are not due.
