# The Payment Details Dialog Box - General 


Use the **Payment Details** dialog  box - **General** tab to enter the  customer payments received. For multiple payments, press the **down 
 arrow** key to create an additional row.


{:.example}
A customer gave the cashier a check but it  was not for the full balance due. The customer then gave the cashier the  remainder of the balance in cash. The cashier entered the check information  in the first row and then created a new row to enter the cash information.


The information in the **General**  tab of the **Payment Details** dialog  box can be classified under the following:

- [Payment  Reference Details]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/payment_reference_details_payment_details_dialog_pos_receipts.html)
- [Payment  Amount Details]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/payment_amount_details_payment_details_dialog_pos_receipts.html)
