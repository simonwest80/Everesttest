# Back-End Processes - Prior Authorization


When prior authorization for a credit card payment is obtained, the  following back-end processes occur:

- When a response  is received from the processing network, the authorization details no  longer appear in the **Batch Credit Card 
 Processing** browser.
- The back-end  processes for approved payments are the same as when payment is made through  cash, check or other methods.
