# Retrieve Manufacturer's Serial Number


You can attach serialized inventory only from 'stock' type of stock  areas to a Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.


{:.steps}
To retrieve manufacturer's serial numbers  into a Point of Sale (sales invoice), do the following:

- From the **Point of Sale (sales invoice)** profile,  select **Options &gt; Attach/Retrieve Serial 
 # &gt; Mfg. 
 Serial**. You will see the **Retrieve 
 Serial Numbers** dialog box.
- Specify the  manufacturer's serial number of the item in the **Manufacturerâ€™s 
 Serial #** field and click **Apply**.
- The serial  number is attached to the line item.



In case the manufacturer's serial number is assigned to more than one  serial number and the item is retrieved into the document using the manufacturer's  serial number, the **Serial Numbers**  browser is displayed. This browser displays a list of serial numbers that  bear the same manufacturer serial number. Select the required serial number  from this browser.


Click the [History]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/retrieving_individual_serial_numbers_pos.html) **** ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/pos_history_button_retrieve_serial_numbers.gif) button to view details  of the serial numbers attached to the item. These details will be displayed  in the lower half of the dialog box.

 only those stock areas in the logged in Location** in the **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Other 
 Flow Control** > **General**  tab) is selected, then, only those stock areas that belong to the logged  in location are displayed.
