# Customer Tracking


The **Customer Tracking** option  (path: **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  profile > **Options &gt; Customer &gt; 
 Customer Tracking**) allows you to access the custom tracking information  for the customer selected in the document. You can also make changes required  to the tracking information.


{:.example}
If a customer is tagged to e-mail  in the group ‘Contact us via’, but wants to be contacted henceforth by  telephone, you can change the tracking.


{:.note}
This option is not enabled if you select a default Point  of Sale customer (POS\_CUST).
