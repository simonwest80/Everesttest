# Default Preferences - Gift Card Processor 


You can select the payment processor for processing the gift  card from the Processor drop-down list with a preference setting (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow 
 Control** > **Documents**  > **Miscellaneous** > **Others** > **Others 
 1** tab). This field is not mandatory, but is necessary to activate,  redeem, and otherwise process your gift cards through a third party gift  card provider like Valutec.

- Select the gift  card processor from the **Gift Card Processor**  field.



{:.note}
A license is required to process gift cards.  Since a Gift Card license is not a user-based license, only one license  is needed for the entire company. The Gift Card feature is available in  the Sample Company and in evaluation mode.
