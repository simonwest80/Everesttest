# Item Price


The selling price of an item is the base price at which the item is  sold to the customer. The difference between the cost of the item (**actual cost** in case of **serialized 
 inventory** and **average cost**  in case of **non-serialized inventory**)  and the selling price of the item is the profit.


Negative Pricing


**Everest** allows you to enter  negative prices for non-inventoried items. Negative pricing is used to  account for discount coupons that are offered to customers in a Point  of Sale transaction.


{:.example}
You may give discount coupons to customers who purchase  more than $100 worth of goods.


{:.steps}
To enter negative prices, do the following:

- Create an item  with ‘Discount Coupons’ as the item code. The item should be a non-inventoried  type of item.

- Enter the item  code/scan the item in the **Point of Sale 
 (sales invoice)** profile.
- Enter a negative  value in the **Price** column. The  system automatically calculates the total price on the document after  taking the discount value into consideration.
