# Customer


By default the **Customer** field  displays the POS\_CUST  code. If this customer code does not exist in your database, **Everest** will automatically create it for you.


You can select a customer other than the default Point of Sale customer  in the following scenarios:

- You owe the  customer a balance that you want to set aside until a further sale.
- You want to  apply an existing deposit or a credit memo to a Point of Sale document.
- You want to  adjust deposits made for layaways.

When you select a customer code from the  **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  profile, the [billing  address]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/billing_address_cust_info_content_pos_docs.html) of the customer is automatically populated.
