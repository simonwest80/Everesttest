# Document Discount Dialog Box


**Discount**
: Use this option to specify a discount percentage  to be applied to all line items in the document.


**Exclude already reduced items**
: If you select this check box, the discount specified  in the **Discount** field is not applicable  to the following:

- An item that  already has a discount specified.
- A line item  whose price is less than the price specified in the **Item**  profile (path: **Inventory** >  **Items** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Sales** tab).



{:.note}
If  the price of a line item is less than the price specified in the **Item** profile, global discount is still  applied even if this check box is selected. It is excluded only if the  price is changed manually.
