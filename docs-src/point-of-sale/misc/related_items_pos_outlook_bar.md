# Related Items


Related items represent items that can be sold or purchased as substitutes  or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item.


Upgrading an item can be defined as selling/purchasing an enhanced version  of an existing product.


Downgrading an item can be defined as selling /purchasing a product  that has fewer features than an existing product.


The **Related** **Items**  feature in **Everest** allows you  to do the following:

- Define multiple  upgrades or downgrades for an item.
- Specify Price  Differentials for the upgrades or downgrades (indicate a fixed price or  a formula as the upgrade price, that will enable you to arrive at a new  price for the upgraded item).
- Assign upgrades/downgrades  and their price differentials to specific item kits.
