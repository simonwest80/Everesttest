**Cash register to be used in invoicing documents**
: This field allows you to define the default cash  register that is to be used when invoicing documents. When the **Default** option is selected in the **Use****Registers in invoicing documents**  option and a cash register is selected in this option, the cash register  specified in this field is automatically used to transfer payments on  invoicing documents.


{:.example}
You select default the cash register as Cash Register  1 in the **Cash register to be used in 
 invoicing documents** field and create a sales order on which you  receive a deposit from your customer; the deposit received against the  sales order is automatically transferred to Cash Register 1.
