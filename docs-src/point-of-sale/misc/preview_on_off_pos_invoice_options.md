# Preview On/Off


The **Preview On/Off** option (path:  **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  profile > **Options &gt; Preview On/Off**)  allows you to view the extended notes for a line item. When an inline  note extends to more than one line, it appears in the line below the line  item.


You can choose to view the inline notes or hide the inline notes. Click  the ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/pos_preview_off.gif) button to view only the first line of the inline  notes or the ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/pos_preview_on.gif) button to view the full content.
