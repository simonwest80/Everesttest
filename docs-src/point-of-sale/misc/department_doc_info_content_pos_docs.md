# Loc/Sub-Loc


The **Loc/Sub-Loc** field in a **Point of Sale (sales invoice)** profile  displays the location or the sub-location to which the document belongs.  When a **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  profile is created, the **Loc/Sub-Loc**  field displays the login location/sub-location.


{:.note}
When you assign a location/sub-location to the document,  you can keep track of the Point of Sale documents by sub-location and  print reports for management information purposes.


{:.example}
You can generate a report of all the Point of Sale (sales  invoice) documents raised by the Cash Counter Number 1 to review the sales  from that counter.


The documentâ€™s location or sub-location detail is required to print  the address and logo on the document. Sub-Locations do not have separate  sequence numbers, address and logos. If a sub-location is selected, the  address and logo of the sub-location's location is used.
