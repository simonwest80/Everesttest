# Tax


If a Special Tax Rule is defined for the login jurisdiction or for the  location of the shipping address, and the **Document 
 Override** option is selected in the **Special 
 Tax Rules** profile (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Taxes &gt; Special Tax Rules &gt; Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**), selecting this option overrides  the Special Tax Rule. If no Special Tax Rule is specified, you cannot  override tax. Click the ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/pos_tax_icon.gif) icon to recalculate taxes for  the Point of Sale (sales invoice) document.
