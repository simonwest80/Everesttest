# Negative Pricing


**Everest** allows you to enter  negative prices for non-inventoried items. Negative pricing is used to  account for discount coupons that are offered to customers in a Point  of Sale transaction. You may give discount coupons to customers who purchase  more than $100 worth of goods.


{:.steps}
To enter negative prices, do the following:

- Create an item  with discount coupons as the item code. The item should be a non-inventoried  type of item.

- Enter the item  code/scan the item in the Point of Sale document.
- Enter a negative  value in the **Price** column. The  system automatically calculates the total price on the document after  taking the discount value into consideration.
