# Add Quantity


If physical quantity of an item is actually available but the same is  NOT reflected in the system stock status of the item, you can bring in  such quantity into the system while creating a Point of Sale invoice by  using the **Add Quantity** option.  This option is enabled only for inventoried, non-serialized items.


{:.steps}
To add quantity of an item, do the following:

- From the **Point of Sale** **(sales 
 invoice)** profile, select a line item. Enter the required quantity  in the **Quantity** column. If there  is insufficient stock of the item in the default stock area, you will  see the **Confirmation** dialog box.  This dialog box allows you to either select another stock area OR add  quantity. The **Confirmation** dialog  box appears provided you have checked the option **Use 
 default stock area to assign quantity for non-serialized items in sales 
 documents** in the **Location**  profile. If this option is unchecked, the **Attach 
 Quantity** dialog box is displayed which allows you to select the  stock area from where you can attach items in the POS Invoice.
- Click on the  **Add Quantity** button. You will  see the **Quantity 
 Adjustment** dialog box. This profile allows you to add quantities  for the selected item.
