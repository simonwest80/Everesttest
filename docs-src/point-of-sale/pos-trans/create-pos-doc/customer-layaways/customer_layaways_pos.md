# Customer Layaways


In customer layaways, the customer reserves one or more items from your  store by paying an initial amount as a guarantee. The balance is paid  later. Layaway items are released to the customer when they are paid for  in full.


Layaways are handled in **Everest**  through sales orders and POS.
