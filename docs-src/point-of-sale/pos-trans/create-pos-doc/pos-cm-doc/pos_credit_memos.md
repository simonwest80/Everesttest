# The Point of Sale (Credit Memo) Profile


You can toggle between a **** **Point of Sale** **** (sales invoice) document and a **Point of Sale** (credit memo) document by selecting the option **Switch to Sales Credit**. A **Point of Sale** (credit memo) document is used to return goods to a customer during a Point of Sale transaction. However, you cannot select this option, if you have already added an item to the **Point of Sale** (sales invoice) document.
