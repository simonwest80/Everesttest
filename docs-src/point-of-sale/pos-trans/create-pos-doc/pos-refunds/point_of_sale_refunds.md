# Point of Sale Refunds


When you save the **Point of Sale****(credit memo)** profile, the [**Payment 
 Details** dialog box]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/payment-dlg/the_payment_details_dialog_box_pos_receipts.html) is automatically displayed. You can account  for refunds through more than one type of tender in this dialog box.


You CANNOT make partial refunds to default Point of Sale customers (POS\_CUST).  You can save the Point of Sale document only after you make full payment.


However, if any other customer is selected in the **Customer** field, you can make partial payments and even make a credit return.  **Everest** prompts you that there  is a balance to be refunded on the document. You can take either of the  following actions:

- **Apply 
 additional payments** - If you select this option, you will return  to the **Payment Details** dialog  box. This option ensures that you refund full payment to your customer.
- **Forward 
 the balance amount to the customer’s account with the payment terms**  - If you select this option, the balance amount payable to the customer  is transferred to the customer’s account. The default payment term for  the customer is retrieved from the **Customer**  profile (path: **Invoicing &gt; Customer 
 &gt; Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window &gt; Payment Information**  tab). You can modify the payment term.



Click **OK** to refund the payment  to the customer.
