# Processing Credit Card Payments


You ca process credit card payments from customers from **Everest**  or outside **Everest**. If you do  not want to use **Everest** to process  certain credit card payments, clear the **Use 
 Payment Processor** check box in the **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window** > **Credit 
 Card Processing** tab).


Credit card payments may be processed using any of the following payment  services that **Everest** supports:

- [ICVerify]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/proc-cc-pmnts/credit_card_processing_with_ic_verify_pos.html)
- [Payflow  Pro]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/pos-trans/create-pos-doc/pos-receipts/proc-cc-pmnts/credit_card_processing_with_payflow_pro_pos.html)



A credit card payment is automatically processed when the payment method  for the credit card has the **Use****Payment Processor** check box selected  in the **Credit Card Processing**  tab.
