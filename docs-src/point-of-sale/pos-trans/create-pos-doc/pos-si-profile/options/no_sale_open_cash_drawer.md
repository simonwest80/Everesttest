# No Sale - Open Cash Drawer


The **No Sale - Open Cash Drawer**  option (path: **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  profile > **Options** > **No Sale - Open Cash Drawer**) allows you  to open the cash drawer even when no sale/return has been made through  the Point of Sale terminal.


You can track the instances during which the cash drawer is opened even  when there is no sale/return by generating the [Store  Closing Report]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/store_closing_report_pos_outlook_bar.html) (path: **POS Cash Registers** browser > **Options** >  **Store Closing Report**).
