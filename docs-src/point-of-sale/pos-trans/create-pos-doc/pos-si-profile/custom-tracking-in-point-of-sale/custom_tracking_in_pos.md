# Custom Tracking in Point of Sale 


The custom tracking groups enabled for invoices are displayed automatically  for selection when you save a Point of Sale document (invoice and sales  credit), if you set a custom tracking preference for documents in the  **Document Tracking** dialog box (path:  **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; 
 Flow Control &gt; Document Tracking**).
