Default Stock Area


During the sales process, while committing Â quantities,  the default stock area is determined by the following rules:

- If a default  stock area for sales orders is specified in the **Assign 
 inventory from &gt; Sales Order** field of the **Workstation 
 Settings** of the user committing the quantities (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; WorkStation 
 Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Sales** tab), the quantities are  assigned to this stock area.
- If no default  stock areas are defined in **Workstation 
 Settings**, the items are assigned to the stock area defined for  sales orders in the login location or the parent location of the login  sub-location (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; 
 Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New 
 Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Sales Document** tab). If no stock  area is defined in the **Location**  profile, the stock area defined for the default location is used.
- If no default  stock areas for sales orders are defined in **Workstation 
 Settings** or in the stock transfer preferences for the logged in  location as above, the default stock area defined for **Purchase 
 Receipts/Invoices** in the **Workstation 
 Settings** of the user committing the quantities is used (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; WorkStation 
 Settings &gt; Stock Areas &gt; For Purchase** tab).
- If no default  stock areas for sales orders or purchase receipts/invoices are defined  in **Workstation Settings** or in  the stock transfer preferences for the logged in location the items are  assigned to the stock area defined in the **Purchase****Receipt/Invoice** field of the **Location** profile (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Location/Sub-Location &gt; Options &gt; 
 Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Stock Transfer &gt; Purchase Document**  tab). If no stock area is defined for login location or the parent location  of the login sub-location, the stock area defined for the default location  is used.



{:.note}
If the option **Allow users to access 
 only those stock areas in the logged in Location** in the **Other 
 Flow Control** dialog box (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Other Flow Control &gt; General**  tab) is selected, only those stock areas that belong to the logged in  location will be displayed.
