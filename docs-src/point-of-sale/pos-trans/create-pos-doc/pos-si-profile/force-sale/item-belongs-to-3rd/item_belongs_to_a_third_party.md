# Force Sale - Item Belongs to a Third Party


When an item that does not exist in the database is sold on behalf of  a third party, you can force a sale in a Point of Sale transaction.


In this case, enter/scan an item code that is non-serialized into the  **Point of Sale (sales invoice)**  document and change the item type for a force sale by clicking in the  **Type** column for the line item  and pressing the **Shift** + **Spacebar** keys. The ![]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/img/pos_force_sale_icon.gif) icon  appears in the **Type** column, indicating  that it is a force sale.


You can view details of items sold through a ‘force sale’  from the Store Closing report (path: **POS 
 Cash Registers** browser > **Options**  > **Store Closing Reports**).
