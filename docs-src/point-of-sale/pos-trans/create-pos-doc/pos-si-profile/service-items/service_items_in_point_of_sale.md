# Service Items in Point of Sale 


You can keep track of items that are received for service or repairs.  To do this, change the item type to 'service'


{:.steps}
To track items received for service and bill  for services rendered, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing** >  **Point of Sale**. You will see the  **POS Cash Registers** browser.
- From the **POS Cash Registers** browser, select **Options** > **Log 
 In**. You will see the **Point of 
 Sale** **(sales invoice)** profile.
- Retrieve the  item code into the document.
- Change the  item type to service. To change the item type to service, click the **Type** column for the line item and press  the **Spacebar** key.
- Attach/Commit  the items returned for repair or service.



{:.note}
The serial number must have to be attached from the  ‘Out’ type of stock areas for items received from customers for service.  They continue to be in the ownership of customers and hence, are not added  back to your stock.

- You can charge  the customer for the service, either by entering a price in the item’s  price column or add another line item for service charges.
