# The Cash Register Profile - Forms Tab


This tab allows you to either associate a form with a document type or use **Everest**â€™s internal reports. You can also attach a logo that will appear when the Point of Sale internal report is printed. The **Forms** tab contains two tabs:

- [Forms]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/the_cash_register_profile_forms_forms.html)
- [Logo]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/the_cash_register_profile_forms_logo.html)
