# Open a Cash Register


When you open a cash register, it is made available for selection. You  can specify the opening balance of cash available. This enables reconciliation  of the cash at the end of each period.


{:.steps}
To open a cash register, do the following:

- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Point 
 of Sale**. You will see the **POS 
 Cash Registers** browser.
- From the **POS Cash Registers** browser, select **Options &gt; New &gt; In New Window/In current 
 Window**. You will see the [**Point of Sale Cash Register** profile]({{site.pos_baseurl}}/misc/point_of_sale_cash_register_profile.html).
- Select the  code of the cash register to be opened in the **Code**  field and specify the opening balance in the **Opening 
 Balance** section.



{:.note}
When the cash register is opened, its status changes  to **Available**. If you try to log  in to a cash register that is already in use, you receive a message stating  that the cash register is in use.


When a cash register is manually closed for further  transactions by using the **Lock**  option, the status changes to **Locked**.


The status of a cash register is displayed in the **Status** column of the **POS 
 Cash Registers** browser.
