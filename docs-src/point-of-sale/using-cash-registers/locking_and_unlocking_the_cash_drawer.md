- From the main  menu bar, select **Invoicing &gt; Point 
 of Sale**. You will see the **POS 
 Cash Registers** browser.
- From the **POS Cash Registers** browser, highlight  the required cash register and select **Options 
 &gt; Lock/Unlock**.

A cash drawer that is locked displays the status ‘Locked’  in the **Status** column of the **POS Cash Registers** browser. You cannot  create transactions from a locked cash register.
