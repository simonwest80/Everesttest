# POS Reconciliation


The **POS Reconciliation** report  displays the reconciliation details of the selected cash register during  the report period. These details are displayed only if the selected cash  register has been reconciled during the specified period. The report displays  the total sales with a breakup for taxable and exempt sales, and the collections  from POS and non-POS documents. It also displays a currency wise break  up of collections for the selected cash register.


This report provides information similar to when a cash register is  declared. However, unlike the process of declaring, this report allows  you to select a period for which you want to view details.
