# Installing Add-Ins


Your add-in provider should give you the necessary setup files to install  **Everest** add-ins. If you do not  receive any setup files, place the Add-in Configuration files (.acf extension)  and DLL files in the **Addins** directory  in the following location:


**..\Icode\Everest\Client\Addins**


{:.example}
C:\Program Files\Icode\Everest\Client\Addins


If you do not see the "Addins" folder in  the Client directory, you must create it.


Restart **Everest** on the workstation  to validate and register the add-ins.


{:.refer}
For more information, refer to the **Everest_Add-Ins**  help file located in the ..\Icode\Everest\Client\Help directory. For example,  if you installed Everest on the C: drive, it is located in the C:\Program  Files\Icode\Everest\Client\Help directory. You can also refer to the **Everest Advanced Edition - Everest** **Add-Ins Developer Guide**.


****Migrating to 
 Microsoft Windows Vista****
: When migrating to the Microsoft Windows Â® Vista  operating system, you must manually move your **Everest**  Add-Ins to the **&lt;ProgramData&gt;\Everest\Addins**  folder.


{:.example}
C:\ProgramData\Everest\Addins
