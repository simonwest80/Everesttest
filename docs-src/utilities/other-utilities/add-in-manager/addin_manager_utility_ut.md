# Add-In Manager Utility


Use the **Add-In** **Manager**  utility (path: **Utility** > **Add-In Manager**) to manage **Everest 
 Add-Ins**. Â The  **Add-In Manager** utility allows  you to view all registered add-ins, enable or disable registered add-ins,  and remove add-ins. Your add-in provider may also allow you to make additional  add-in configurations from this utility. You must have an add-in security  right to launch the **Add-In Manager**  utility.


{:.example}
A programmer creates a Debit Card Processing  add-in for **Everest** Point of Sale  and installs it into **Everest**.  The head cashier uses the **Add-In****Manager** utility to manage this  add-in and enables it on the **Everest**  Point of Sale workstations. After the add-in is enabled and a cashier  selects the Debit Card payment type, the Debit Card Processing add-in  launches and the cashier processes the debit card through the **Everest**  Add-In. When the debit card processing is complete, the add-in closes  and the cashier continues with the **Everest**  Point of Sale application.
