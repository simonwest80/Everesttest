# Import Third Party Catalogs into Everest


You can import items from third party databases such as vendor or competitor's  catalogs and display them on your online store, or browse for quick reference  during the purchase or sales cycles. The **Third 
 Party Catalog Wizard** acts as a single interface for importing catalogs  of a third party.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) A  vendor updates their electronic catalog every month. This catalog can  be imported into **Everest**. Your  purchase department can view the vendor's catalog to see whether they  sell a particular product and at what price. The sales department could  also browse the catalog to see if an item can be specially ordered for  a customer. The sales department can also use the information to make  a better offer to the customer.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/steps.gif)To import third party catalogs into Everest,  do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Utility** > **Import** > **Third 
 Party Catalog**. You will see the **Third 
 Party Catalog Import Wizard**.



When you access the **Third Party Import 
 Catalog Wizard**, you will see the **Welcome**  section of the wizard.


Click **Next**. You will see the  **Import 
 Type** section of the wizard.
