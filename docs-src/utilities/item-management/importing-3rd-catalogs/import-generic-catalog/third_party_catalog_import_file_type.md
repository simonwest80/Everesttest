# Third Party Catalog Import - File Type


This section is used to specify the type of import process that needs  to be carried out. **Everest** allows  you to recreate the database or to update the existing database.


**Import File Type**
: Data can be imported into **Everest**  from [ASCII Text File]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/db-utils/data-import/wizard/src-file-selection/text-file-excel-spreadsheet/import_from_ascii_text_file.html) format.

- **ASCII 
 text file** - Use this option to import ASCII text files into **Everest**. Select the type of file from  which you wish to import data by clicking the button next to the field.



{:.hint}
Clean up your Excel source files before importing  them. Remove rows that contain only empty cells by selecting the entire  row and deleting it. Otherwise, the empty rows import as valid data rows  and cause errors because mandatory values are missing.


Click **Next**. You will see the  [**Source 
 Table**]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/item-management/importing-3rd-catalogs/import-generic-catalog/third_party_catalog_import_source_table_.html) section.
