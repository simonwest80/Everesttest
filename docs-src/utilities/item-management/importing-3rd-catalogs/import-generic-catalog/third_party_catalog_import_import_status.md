# Third Party Catalog Import - Import Status


Click **Update** to start importing.  When the import process is finished, click the ![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/utility_error_log_button.gif) icon to view  the error log file that displays the records that could not be imported.


{:.note}
The above import process is similar if you  select **Overwrite** **existing 
 catalog** and **Update prices and 
 stock quantities** **in existing catalog**  as the **Import Type**. The existing  catalog can be selected in the **Third 
 Party Catalog** field in the **Third 
 Party Catalog Import Wizard**.


Click **Close** to exit from the  wizard.
