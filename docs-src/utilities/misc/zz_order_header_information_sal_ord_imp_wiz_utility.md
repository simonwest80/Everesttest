title: Order Header Information
---


The columns in the **Order Header Information**  grid display information such as order number, billing and shipping addresses,  e-mail, telephone number, credit card details, payment and address verification  code for the orders generated on the online store.


By default all the orders display a check mark in the **Select**  column indicating they are selected for import. If you do not want to  import any order you have to uncheck it in this column.
