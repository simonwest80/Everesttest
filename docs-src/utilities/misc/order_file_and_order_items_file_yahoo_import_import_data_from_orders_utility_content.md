Data from the online store must first be converted to the .CSV  (comma separated variables format) before it is imported into **Everest**.  Only data that has been converted into .CSV format can be imported into  **Everest**. The data converted to  the .CSV format is stored in two files, the **Order**  file and the **Order** **Items**  file.


Order File


The **Order** file comprises a list  of all the orders generated for the online shop along with the order number.


Order Items File


The **Order** **Items**  file comprises a list of all the items details (item code, price, quantity  etc.) for each order generated on the online shop along with the order  number.
