# Update Key


The **Database Update** Utility  is used to update the system and company databases. When you create a  company in **Everest**, a company  database which has all the details pertaining to that company is created  automatically. The system database contains common data required for the  smooth functioning of all the company databases.

- When you install  a new version of **Everest**, the  default databases are updated. The system database and the company databases  are not updated. Thus, when the user tries to login into **Everest**  the next time, a mismatch between the default database and the company  or system database is detected.
- **Everest**  displays a message and enquires  to proceed with the update  process.
- **Everest**  then compares the databases and identifies if the company or system database  has to be updated.
- You will not be  able to login to **Everest** unless  you have updated the database.

 Update** utility before the Update utility is run in case of version  mismatch. A single update key is required and this will update all activated  options for the company.


For US Payroll, the activation code will have the last date for which  transactions can be created. A new activation code is required to update  the company profile each time the company subscribes to an yearly payroll  update.
