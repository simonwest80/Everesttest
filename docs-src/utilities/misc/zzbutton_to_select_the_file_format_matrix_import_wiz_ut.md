Click the ![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/importmatrix_select_file_button_ut.gif) Â button  to attach the Excel Spreadsheet import file. Your selection appears in  the **Select the Excel Spreadsheet**  field.


**Points to remember**


{:.hint}
Clean up your Excel source files before importing  them. Remove rows that contain only empty cells by selecting the entire  row and deleting it.

- Only a maximum  of five attributes is allowed for each matrix group.
- Create separate  import files for each matrix group. Essentially, items of each matrix  group have the same attributes. Separate import files must be created  for each batch of product styles that have different attributes.



{:.example}
You have 500 styles that use the Size, Color,  and Width attributes.


You have another 250 styles that use the Size  and Color attributes.


You  must import these products separately using two different import files.
