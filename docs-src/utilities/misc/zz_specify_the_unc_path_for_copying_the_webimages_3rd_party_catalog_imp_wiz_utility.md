title: Specify the UNC path for copying the WebImages
---


Enter the path (\\server name\shared folder name) where the third party  catalog images must be copied.


An UNC is a naming convention that permits you to use a network resource,  such as a network server, without formally connecting to the network resource  with a mapped drive.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) The file  you want to copy exists on a server. Let us call it "Images". It also  must be in a folder on that server. Let us call it "Files". If you share  the folder you can access it remotely by connecting to \\IMAGES\FILES.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/note.gif) If no path is specified and you click Next, the wizard  will directly go to the **Update/Add**  section.
