# Edit Clear Lock Job dialog box


When a user opens any master record (Item profile, Customer profile, etc.) or any transaction record (sales order, purchase order etc.) for modification, **Everest** locks that record so that another user cannot modify it at the same time. When the user closes the record, the lock is released.


A user cannot modify a locked record until the lock is released. If a user opens a record and the user is inactive for a long time, **Everest** is enabled to clear all locks set by inactive users. The time limit for treating a user as inactive is set in this dialog box.


**Occurs Every**


Enter the number of minutes/hours after which the locks can be cleared. Specify the unit of time (minutes or hours) using the field beside the **Occurs** **Every** field.
