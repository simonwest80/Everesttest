When you import data into **Everest**  using **Text** files, you can specify  a delimiter, which is a character, used to signal the end of each field  in the source file. The delimiter separates the fields in the source file  and arranges the data in columnar format into the imported file.


The field delimiters are listed below:


| **Tab** | Identifies a single tab between each field in the import data file. |
| **Comma** | Identifies a single comma between each field in the export data file. |
| **Space** | Identifies a single space between each field in the import data file. |
| **Semicolon** | Identifies a single semicolon between each field in the export data  file. |
| **Others** | Use the option to specify a new field delimiter. |
