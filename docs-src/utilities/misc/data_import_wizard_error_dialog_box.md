# Error Dialog Box


The **Error** dialog box allows  you to do the following:


**Skip erroneous records and continue with import**
: Select this option to import only those records  that do not have errors to your database. The erroneous records are listed  in a text file called Â DataImportErrorRecords.txt  in the **Utilities** folder where  **Everest** is installed.


**Return to wizard to fix errors**
: Select this option to delete the imported records  and return to the wizard to fix issues, which have led to erroneous records  being imported.


**Abort import process and exit from the wizard**
: Select this option to cancel the import process  and close the wizard.


**View Error**
: Click this button to view the DataImport.log  file, which lists the errors occurred during the import process.
