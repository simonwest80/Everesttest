- **None**  - checks if none of the conditions are met.
- **Not 
 all** - checks if not all of the conditions are met.



Indicate Parameters


To indicate a parameter to be selected, place a colon (:)  in front of the parameter, such as **:AMOUNT**.  Use the Parameter Information tab to further define the parameter. This  allows you to create an interactive query.
