title: Create a new customer unless billing address found with matching
---

- **E-mail 
 ID** – Select this option if you do not want to create a new customer  when the E-mail ID of the customer billing address entered in the online  store matches the existing billing address in the **Everest**  database. 
If this field is blank in both the imported billing address and in  the existing billing address in **Everest**,  a comparison is not possible and therefore the system creates a new Customer  profile.
- **Street 
 Address, Zip and E-mail ID** – Select this option if you do not want  to create a new customer when the Street Address, Zip, and E-mail ID fields  of the customer billing address entered in the online store match the  existing billing address in the **Everest**  database. If any one of these fields does not match, the system creates  a new customer. 
If any of these fields are blank in both the imported billing address  and in the existing billing address in **Everest**,  the system considers these field values the same for this field and does  not create a new customer profile based on this field.
- **Street 
 Address, Zip, E-mail ID and Telephone-1** – Select this option if  you do not want to create a new customer when the Street Address, Zip,  E-mail ID, and Telephone-1 fields of the customer billing address entered  in the online store match the existing billing address in the **Everest**  database. If any one of these fields does not match, the system creates  a new customer. 
If any of these fields are blank in both the imported billing address  and in the existing billing address in **Everest**,  the system considers these field values the same for this field and does  not create a new customer profile based on this field.



For all of the above options, fields match if they contain identical  values. A field with a value does not match a blank field.
