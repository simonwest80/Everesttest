title: Increment Value
---


Specify the incremental value for sequence numbers to be  generated.


{:.example}
To generate serial numbers for 1000 serialized  items, give the start value as 1(or a number of your choice) and define  the auto increment as 1. When the data is imported, serial numbers for  all the imported items are generated automatically and assigned the numbers  1 to 1000.


{:.example}
If 100 items must be serially numbered and  the first serial number is A001, give 1 as the increment value to generate  serial numbers as A002, A003 and so on.

If the **Prefix** and  **Suffix** fields are numeric characters,  only the start value is incremented.
