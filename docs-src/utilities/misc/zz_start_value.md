Define the start value to generate sequential numbers for your data.


{:.note}
The start value has to be numeric.


![]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) You  want to generate serial numbers for 1000 serialized items, you can give  the start value as 1 (or a number of your choice) and define the auto  increment as 1. When the data is imported, the serial numbers for all  the imported items are generated automatically and assigned the numbers  1 to 1000.
