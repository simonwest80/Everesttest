# Default Delivery Method


This field allows you to specify the preferred delivery method if the  delivery method in **Everest** does  not match that of the sales order. You can use a different delivery method  for individual sales documents by selecting it in the document profile.  Shipment charges for sales documents are calculated based on the delivery  method selected.
