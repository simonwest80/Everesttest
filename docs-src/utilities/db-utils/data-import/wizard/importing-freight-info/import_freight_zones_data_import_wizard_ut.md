A zone can be a single state, a country, or a region, depending on how  you want to charge freight on shipments. These zones help to estimate  the freight charge for a smaller region (such as a city or zip code).  When computing freight, Everest calculates the charges based on the zone  in which the shipping address is defined.


{:.steps}
To import freight zone information into Everest,  do the following:

- Create the freight  zone import file for **Everest**.  Download rate and zone files from your freight carrier's website. Â If  you do not see them published there, contact your Account Manager for  the carrier (i.e. UPS or FedEx) to request the files in .CSV or Excel  format. See the **Freight 
 Zone Import File Format** section for this information.


- Review the Freight  Zone import template in the following directory:
..\Icode\Everest\Client\Utilities\ImportTemplates
- From the main menu  bar, select **Utility** > **Import** > **Data**.  You will see the **Data Import Wizard**.
- Select **Next**.  You will see the **Select Data to Import**  screen.
- In the **Import 
 Data Description** column, select **Freight 
 Zones**.
- Click **Next**.  The **Source File Selection** screen  is displayed.



**Import File Type**
: Select the type of file to be imported, such as  Excel or Text.
