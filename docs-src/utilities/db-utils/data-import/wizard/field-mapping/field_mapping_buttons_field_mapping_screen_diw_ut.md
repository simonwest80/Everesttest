# Field Mapping Buttons


The following buttons are available on the **Field 
 Mapping** screen:


**Save Settings**
: Click the **Save 
 Settings** button to save the mapped settings along with the file  settings to a .Map file for later use. The file path, file format, and  file setup information is saved along with the **Field 
 Mapping** settings.


{:.example}
When you import item categories, save the  field mappings in a file. When you import other categories into **Everest**, load the Map Field Settings  from this file and the fields will be mapped automatically.


**Advanced**
: Click the **Advanced**  button to view the **Filters** dialog  box. You can filter out unwanted characters such as commas, semicolon,  colon or any user defined character from the source data.

**Verify File (Optional)**
: After you finish mapping, you can click the **Verify File** button to start an integrity  check of the file to be imported. The verification process tests the file  to identify any potential errors that would occur during file import.  It is a best practice to do the verification but you can speed up the  import process by skipping this step, especially if you are more familiar  with the **Everest** data import process.


When the process is complete, a window displays the verification status  with a link to a log file.

- If problems are  found, click the link to the log file to view a description of the errors.  Correct the errors to continue with the import process.
- If no problems  are found, you can continue to import the file.
