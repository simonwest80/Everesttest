# Map the Source Fields


The **Map the Source Fields** section  maps the fields that have to be imported (in the source table) with the  fields in the destination table. Fields that have not been mapped in the  destination table can have a default value or can be auto incremented.


The **Map the Source Fields** section  consists of the **Destination** and  **Source** panels.


**Destination Panel**
: The **Destination** panel displays the column name, description, type and size of the  **Everest** database table.


**Source Panel**
: The **Source**  panel displays the column name and a sample view of the data in the source  file.


{:.note}
All mandatory fields in the destination file  have to be mapped to the relevant fields in the source file.


Click **Start**. You will see the  **Importing 
 Shipment Tracking Information** section.
