# Sales Order Import


The **Sales Order Import** utility  (path: **Utility &gt; Import &gt; Sales 
 Orders &gt; Import**) allows you to import sales order information  created in your website. When you import data, a sales order is generated  in **Everest** for each sales order  created on the online store.


You can also use the **Sales Order Import**  utility to import orders created in an online store provided it is in  the same format.


{:.note}
Data is imported into **Everest**  in a pre-defined format using .CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. All  data that is to be imported from your online store must be converted to  the .CSV file format.


When sales orders are being imported, **Everest** checks  for  the validity of US Zip codes (in the sales orders) against the zip code  table, and if any zip code  does  not exist, relevant events  are  triggered.
