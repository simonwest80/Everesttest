Select Data to Import


Create a .xls (.csv) file with each add-on item in a row and map the  add-on item to the Parent Item Code and Rank in separate columns.


Refer to the **AddonItem.xls** file  in the **c:\Program Files\Icode\Everest\Client\Utilities\ImportTemplates**  folder to create the import file.


{:.note}
It is important your import file is an exact  copy of the sample sheet named "sample" in the template.


{:.example}
You have five add-on items (Camera bag, Flash  bulb, Memory Card, Extra Battery and Extra Battery Charger) for the parent  item camera of a particular model and you wish to rank the Add-on items  in the order in which they should appear. There are 25 models of the camera  and each model has five Add-on items. Create an excel with the data and  import the Add-on items with the Everest Add-on Items Import Wizard easily.


{:.hint}
Clean up your excel source files before importing  them. Remove rows that


contain only empty cells by selecting the  entire row and deleting it.


**Everest** allows you to import  data from excel files of the following file formats:

- .xls
- .xlsx
