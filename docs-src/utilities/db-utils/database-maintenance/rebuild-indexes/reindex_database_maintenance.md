# Rebuild Indexes


When a database is created, it is indexed on various fields to make  data retrieval easier and more efficient. Over a period of time, however,  these indices can lose their integrity or get corrupted, resulting in  errors. Re-indexing your data files optimizes your database and computer  performance. The re-indexing process rebuilds all the indices of all the  tables in the database, for the logged-in company.


{:.warn}
Re-indexing of the database should be performed  when all users have logged out. Only a supervisor, or a user with equivalent  rights and knowledge should re-index the database.


{:.steps}
To re-index your database, do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Utility &gt; Database Maintenance 
 &gt; Rebuild Indexes**. You will see the [**Reindexing**]({{site.utl_baseurl}}/db-utils/database-maintenance/rebuild-indexes/reindexing_dialog_box.html)  dialog box.
