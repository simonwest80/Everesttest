# Item Categories


Item categories are groups under which related items are classified.  The item categories created are specific to each business and type of  industry. Item categories can be created according to:

- **Types 
 of items:** Items can be classified into raw materials, semi-finished  goods, finished goods.
- **Value:**  Items can be classified into high value, medium value or low value items.
- **Importance:**  Items can also be categorized into high priority, low priority and critical  items.
- **Product 
 lines:** Items can be grouped based on the product line such as women's  clothing, men's clothing, children's clothing or books, music or gifts.
- **Business 
 function:** Items can also be classified based on the business functions  in which they arise such as administrative expenses, operational expenses,  sales and distribution expenses.



Often, categories have to be created in multiple levels adopting more  than one method of classification. You can create any number of levels  of item categories and subcategories, to suit your business best.
