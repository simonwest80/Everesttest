# Default Vendor


Default vendor is the vendor from whom you would normally purchase an  item.


You can set default vendors for every item created in **Everest**.  This information can be used to contact the appropriate vendor when there  is shortage of a particular item.


Specifying the default vendor will enable you to automatically create  purchase orders for items that have or have not fallen below the minimum  quantity.
