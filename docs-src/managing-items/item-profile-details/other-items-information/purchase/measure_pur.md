# Purchase Measure


Measure helps you sell or purchase items in formats other than a single  unit. **Everest** allows you to set  measures for items that are purchased and sold. You can specify a different  measure for the purchase and sale of an item.


{:.example}
**You could purchase computer cable by meter  and sell it by foot or you can buy soft drink cans by cartons and sell  them by the can.**
