# Quantity Entry Method


The **Quantity entry method** for  the item determines how quantities of the item will be entered and with  what precision. **Everest** provides  you with two types of quantity entry methods:

- [Fractional  method]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/misc/fractional.html)
- [Decimal  method]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/misc/decimal.html)



**Value of Stock**


The value of stock that is computed when these methods are selected  are illustrated in the following example:


{:.example}
If an  item's measure is a kilogram, and the measure comprises 1000 grams, 2  kilograms and a half at a cost of $2 would be expressed as 2:500 under  the fractional method. The value of the quantity would be calculated as  follows:


2 \* $2 + (500/1000)\*$2


If the quantity is 2 kilograms and 500 grams with a decimal accuracy  of 3, the quantity under the decimal method would be expressed as 2.500.


The value of the quantity would be calculated as follows:


2.500\*$2
