# Sales Price Inclusive of Tax


Use the **Tax inclusive selling price**  option to specify that the price of an item as displayed in the **Item Price** column of a sales document  is inclusive of sales tax applicable to the item. When this option is  selected, **Everest** computes the  sales tax for the item and will derive the base selling price. The base  selling price of the item is the price excluding the sales tax applicable.


{:.example}
If an itemâ€™s selling price is $110, which is inclusive of 10% sales  tax, the base-selling price that accounts for the revenue is $100.

The purpose of arriving at the base selling price of an item whose price  is inclusive of tax is as follows:

- To identify  the revenues to be accounted.
- To identify  the amount of tax collected and payable to the Tax Authorities.
- To compute  discount, if any, on the base price rather than on the tax inclusive price.
- To compute  commission payable to sales persons based on the revenues rather than  on the tax inclusive price.
