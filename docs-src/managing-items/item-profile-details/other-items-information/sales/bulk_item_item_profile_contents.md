# Bulk Item


An item that needs to be packed separately due to its physical attributes is called a bulk item. Use this option to specify the method of packaging an item. Select this check box if the item should be packed and shipped separately. An item that is not a bulk item is a "Piece item". Piece items can be packed together with other items.
