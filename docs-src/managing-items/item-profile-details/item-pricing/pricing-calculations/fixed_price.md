# Fixed Price


The selling price of the item or the price per sales measure is fixed.  Besides the base selling price, you can specify the selling price for  each customer level in the Customer Levels Grid, displayed below the **Fixed Price** field. If you do NOT specify  a selling price for a level, the base selling price is applied to all  the customers in that level. This option is normally used for items with  stable margins; where there are no major fluctuations in item costs.


{:.note}
If you want **Everest** to consider  the fixed price while determining  the  item’s least price on sales orders and invoices, clear the option **Customer level price to override list price 
 for price calculation** (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Pricing/Discounts**  tab).
