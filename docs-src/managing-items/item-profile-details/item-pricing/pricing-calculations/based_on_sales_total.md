# Based on Sales Total


In this method, the selling price is calculated as a percentage of the  total value of all other items added to the document prior to this item.


{:.example}
**The selling price of Packing Charges may be  calculated at 10% of invoice value and that of Freight at 1.5% of invoice  total. If an invoice has 3 items in it with total value of $100 and Packing  Charge is added first followed by Freight, the selling price of Packing  Charge would be $10 and selling price of freight would be $1.65 (1.5%  of $110).**


You can also specify a minimum amount to be billed, if the calculated  price is less than the minimum amount.


The **Based on Sales Total** method  is normally used for service items like freight, packing charges and insurance  where the value of the service is linked to the invoice value.
