# Special Pricing


**Everest** allows you to set up  special pricing rules for items in your inventory, freight charges and  documents. You can also apply them to your promotion schemes by associating  the promotion code with the special prices.


{:.example}
Special Pricing schemes such as the following can be set up:

- All sales orders  above $500 get a 10% discount
- All items of  a specific brand get a 15% off
- Free shipping  for all sales orders above $250.


Special Pricing schemes can be tailored for a specific customer, a group  of customers or for all customers in **Everest**.  You can offer special pricing for all items, specific item, a tracking  choice, an item category, an item brand or for items of a brand in a particular  category.


{:.note}
- Prices are applicable  to each unit of measure.
- Special pricing  will not apply any rules or discount rates to items that have their selling  price defined as 0 in the **Item**  profile, even after a price is entered in the Point of Sale document.  Â Such items  will come into documents with price 0and any discount rates will have  to be defined manually.
