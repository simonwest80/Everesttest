# Item Information


If the item is a product, you can adopt the item's 12 digit Universal  Product Code number or define your own item code. The UPC  bar codes have 11 digits with a check digit added as the 12th.


Items can have only the UPC  numbers by selecting the **UPC**  option in **Bar Code type** field  in the **Items** dialog box (path:  **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow 
 Control** > **Items &gt; Item Details** tab).


Although defining your own item code helps in easier identification,  using the UPC  number as your item code has the following advantages:

- It serves as  a common identifier for both your customers and vendors. You can send  a copy of the purchase order directly to the vendor without having to  change your item code to match the vendor's item code.



{:.example}
If the UPC  number for an item is 123456789123 and your user-defined item code is  LEVI215, you have to create a new purchase order for the vendor, with  the vendor's item code.

- It helps in  automating your supply chain.



{:.example}
When you receive items from your vendor with  a UPCbarcode,  you can scan it into your inventory without having to map it to your item  code.
