# Inventoried Items


Inventoried items are those items for which the quantity and value of  stock are maintained.


{:.example}
Stocks of traded items.


Inventoried items are initially accounted as assets; when they are sold  or used in production, their cost is expensed (treated as an expense).  All products purchased do not have to be inventoried items


{:.example}
You may be using large quantities of paper  clips and purchasing these in cases. But, since these items are of low  value, you may not want to maintain stocks of them.


{:.note}
By default, while assembly type of items are set up as inventoried items,  kits are set up as non-inventoried items.
