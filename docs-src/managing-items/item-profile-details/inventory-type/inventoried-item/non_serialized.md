# Non-serialized Inventoried Items


It is impractical to serialize items like medicine bottles or clothing  as they are normally tracked by the batch or lot numbers of manufacture.  All units manufactured in a single batch are assigned a lot number.


When items are created as non-serialized, their cost is calculated based  on the weighted average cost of all the items in stock.


{:.example}
**If you buy 100 units of an item at the rate  of $10 and another 100 units of the same item at $11, the cost of the  item would be averaged at $10.50.**


**Setting up an item as a non-serialized inventoried  item allows you to execute the following functions:**

- Assign lot  numbers to all the items purchased in a lot.
- Track the stock  of these items lot-wise for each stock area/bin.
- Assign the  manufacturer's lot number.
- Obtain the  average cost information for the item.
- Track the movement  of units belonging to a lot through the purchase, sale, assembly or return  processes.
