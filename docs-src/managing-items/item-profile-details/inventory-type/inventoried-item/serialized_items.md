# Serialized Items


Items for which pricing, cost, location and transaction history are  tracked for every individual piece are called serialized items.


{:.example}
**Dealers in computer hardware require information  on individual units of processors, and not just on the total stock.**


At the time of purchase, if you specify an item as serialized, Everest  automatically generates the serial numbers for it. You can print the serial  number labels and affix them to the items. You can also assign the manufacturer's  serial numbers by scanning the barcodes.  When you sell the item, you can select or scan the serial number of the  unit shipped to the customer. Items are set up as serialized items in  the following cases:

- When warranties  are in force against each unit purchased or sold.



{:.example}
Warranties are given for microprocessor chips specified by serial number.

- Where the item  is of high value and insurance policies are in force against individual  units.



{:.example}
Automobile insurance policies are given against the engine chassis number.

- It is necessary  to trace the defectives and returns individually.



{:.example}
If more than one vendor supplies the same item, and defectives are found  in a consignment, serializing ensures that the defective is returned to  the correct vendor. Similarly, if you are one of the suppliers to a customer  for an item, serializing will ensure that only the units that you sold  are returned to you.


**Setting up an item as a serialized item in Everest  allows you to:**

- Uniquely identify  each unit of the item.
- Assign the  manufacturer's serial number to the unit.
- Obtain the  exact cost information for each unit.
- Track the movement  of each unit through the purchase, sale, assembly or return processes.
