# Differences between a Kit and an Assembly

- Items that are components of a kit continue to form a part of their individual stocks until sale whereas items that are components of an assembly are reduced from their individual stocks during manufacture.
- Stocks of kits are not maintained, but an assembled item has its own inventory.
- When a kit is sold, all components of the kit are added to the sales document; when an assembly item is sold, it becomes a single item in the sales document.
- The composition of a kit can be altered at the time of sale; the composition of an assembly can be altered only during manufacture.
