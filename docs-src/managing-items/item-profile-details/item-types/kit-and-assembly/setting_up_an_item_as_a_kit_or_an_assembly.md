# Creating an Item as a Kit or Assembly


The choice of setting up an item as a kit or an assembly depends on  the type of the final item.


**Set up an item as a kit in the following  scenarios:**

- When putting  together the items does not require significant value-addition of labor  and other resources.



{:.example}
Putting together a tennis kit that comprises  two tennis rackets, a pair of tennis ball and a sweat shirt does not require  too much labor.

- You sell the  components as individual items, and these sales are significant.



{:.example}
If the individual sales of the components  of a multimedia system are significant, it would be beneficial to set  up the multimedia system as a kit.

- The composition  of the item can be configured by the customer by upgrading/downgrading  it.



{:.example}
Sellers of computer workstations give the  customers the option to decide the configuration of the product.


****Set up an 
 item as an assembly** **in the following 
 scenarios**:**

- When significant  value-addition is required before the item is ready for sale.



{:.example}
Electronic products like calculators are assembled  items, where labor and overheads form a good percentage of the final costs.

- It is important  to control and track variances in the cost of the final product by tracking  variations of input costs (material, labor and overheads) for each batch  assembled.
- The customer  is not given the option of configuring the product.



{:.example}
Laptops normally have a standard configuration  and it is better to create these as assemblies instead of kits.

- The item components  do not have any individual sales and it is important to maintain the inventory  of the final product.
