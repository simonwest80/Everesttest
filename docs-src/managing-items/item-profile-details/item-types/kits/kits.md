# Item Kits


A kit is a group of items sold as a single unit. When a kit is sold,  all the components of the kit are added to the sales document. The composition  of a kit can be altered at the time of sale.


{:.example}
A computer kit may consist of items such as  a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse.


You  may sell a tennis kit with two tennis rackets, a pair of tennis balls  and a sweatshirt.


{:.note}
**Everest** handles kits as a single  item even though it consists of a group of items.
