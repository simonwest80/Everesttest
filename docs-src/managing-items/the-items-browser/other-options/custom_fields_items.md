# Custom Fields


The **Custom Fields** feature in  **Everest** provides the ability to  track records based on user-defined fields. Custom fields are available  for item, vendor, customer and serial number profiles, contact manager  tasks as well as all documents. They can be a character string, a date  field, a logical field or a numeric field. Up to four custom fields can  be displayed in the associated browser.


{:.example}
In an item’s profile, you might want to maintain a record of the item’s  color, texture, or expiry  date.


When you select this option the **Custom 
 Fields - Item** profile is displayed. You can enter data in the custom  fields for the selected item. You can also add or modify custom fields  setup for items.
