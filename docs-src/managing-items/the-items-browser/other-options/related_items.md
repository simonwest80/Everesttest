# Related Items


Related items represent items that can be sold or purchased as substitutes  or as an upgrade/downgrade for an item.


Upgrading an item can be defined as selling/purchasing an enhanced version  of an existing product.


Downgrading an item can be defined as selling /purchasing a product  that has fewer features than an existing product.


The **Related** **Items**  feature in **Everest** allows you  to do the following:

- Define multiple  upgrades or downgrades for an item. You can also define multiple related  items with the same item code but with different sales measures.
- Specify Price  Differentials for the upgrades or downgrades (indicate a fixed price or  a formula as the upgrade price, that will enable you to arrive at a new  price for the upgraded item).
- Assign upgrades/downgrades  and their price differentials to specific item kits.

**While adding items to the document, if there  is not enough stock, the **Related****Items** browser will be automatically  displayed prompting you to select a related item as replacement. The prompt  will occur only if you have set up related items. You will have to set  the preference under **File &gt; Setup 
 &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Prompts &gt; Sales 
 Document &gt; Sales Document 2** tab for prompting the user to select  related items for items not available in stock.**


Related items also apply to Matrix Groups and kits.
