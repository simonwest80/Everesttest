# Assign Matrix Elements to a Custom Tracking Group


The **Matrix Element Tracking**  option can be assigned to track a matrix element. This allows you to showcase  individual elements of your matrix groups on your webstore. For example,  you can assign the elements “Burgundy”, “Crimson” and “Cardinal” to a  “Popular Colors”custom tracking group on your webstore with the “Red”  tracking selection. This enables web shoppers to click a single “Red”  link to locate red shoes regardless of the color shade.


{:.steps}
To assign matrix element tracking, do the  following:

- From the **Matrix Elements** browser (path: **Inventory** > **Item 
 Matrix** > **Matrix** **Elements**), highlight the element to  be tracked and select **Options**  > **Matrix Element** **Tracking**.  You will see the **Custom Tracking**  browser for the element.
- Highlight the Tracking  Group you wish to apply. The Tracking Choices tagged to the group are  displayed.
- Select the checkbox  in the **Tag** column to tag the tracking  choice.
- Save your selection.



{:.example}
Assign the elements “green”, “lime”, and “kelly”  to the “Green” selection for the “Popular Colors” tracking group to track  green shoes. Customers can then click the “Green” link under Popular Colors  on the webstore to see shoes in various shades of green.
