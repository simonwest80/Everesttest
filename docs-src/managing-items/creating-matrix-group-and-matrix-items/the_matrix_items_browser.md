# The Matrix Items Browser


The **Matrix Items** browser is  displayed when the **View Items** option  is selected from the **Item**   **Matrix 
 Groups** browser (path: **Inventory 
 &gt; Item Matrix** > **Matrix Group**).  This browser lists all the items belonging to the selected matrix group.   It is similar  to the **Items** browser. In addition,  it displays the attribute details and lists all the item combinations  that are not selected by you while creating the Item Matrix group. This  browser also has the standard menu options.
