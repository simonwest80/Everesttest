# Copy a Matrix Group


Use the **Item Matrix Wizard** to  copy a matrix group. You can save a matrix group with a different code  and prefix without changing any other details. Changing the matrix code  and prefix is mandatory while saving a matrix group with the same matrix  items to create a copy.


{:.steps}
To copy a matrix group, do the following:

- From the main menu,  click **Inventory** > **Item 
 Matrix** > **Matrix Groups**.  You will see the **Matrix Groups**  browser.
- Select **Options**  > **New**. You will see the **Item Matrix Wizard**.
- Select the matrix  group that you wish to copy from the matrix code dropdown menu. The matrix  group displays with all the attributes and elements.
- Change the **Matrix code** and **Prefix**.  The code and prefix of a matrix group must be changed to copy and save  the matrix items as a different matrix group. You may retain the other  details of the original matrix group such as Description, Element Separator,  Attributes and Elements.
- Click **Next**.  You will see the **Matrix Items to be Generated**  section of the **Item Matrix** **Wizard**.
- Select the required  matrix items and click **Next**. You  will see the **Item** profile.
- Select the category  and other fields as required.
- Click **Save 
 and Close**.



You have created another matrix group by copying the existing  matrix group.
