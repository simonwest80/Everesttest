# Ignore Special Pricing and Element Tracking Settings for Matrix Groups


Preference settings are available for ignoring the special  pricing only for matrix groups. This setting is useful to quickly stop  promotions on special pricing elements only for matrix groups and may  also be used by **Everest Technical Support**  to troubleshoot system performance. To ignore special pricing only for  matrix elements, select the checkbox **Ignore 
 special pricing for matrix groups and element tracking** in the **Pricing/Discounts** tab (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow Control** > **Documents**  > **Pricing/Discounts**).

{:.example}
A garment company sells more than 10,000 varieties  of garments which are inventoried as matrix groups/items. The company  also sells 50 different items as accessories. For setting a special discount  only for the accessories, apply special pricing to all the items in the  **Special Pricing** browser (path:  **Inventory** > **Discounts**  > **Special Pricing**), and select  this checkbox to ignore the special pricing only for the matrix groups.
