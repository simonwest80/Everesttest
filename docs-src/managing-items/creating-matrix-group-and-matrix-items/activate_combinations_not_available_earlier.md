# Activate Combinations not Selected Previously


When creating an item matrix group, you need not select all the available  combinations of attributes and elements as items. At a later stage, you  may want to add a few more items to your database, based on the existing  attributes and elements of the item matrix group.


{:.steps}
To add items from an existing item matrix group, do the following:

- From the main  menu, select **Inventory** >**Item Matrix** > **Matrix 
 Groups**. You will see the **Item 
 Matrix Groups** browser.
- From the **Item Matrix Groups** browser, highlight  the required matrix group and select **Options**  > **View Items**. You will see  the **Matrix Items** browser.
- From the **Matrix Items** browser, highlight the  required item and select **Options**  > **Select Item**.
- The selected  item is added to the database.
