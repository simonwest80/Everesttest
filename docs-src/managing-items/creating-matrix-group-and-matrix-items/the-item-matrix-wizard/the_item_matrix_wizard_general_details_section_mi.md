# The Item Matrix Wizard - General Details Section


General Details


**Matrix code (Optional)**
: Enter a unique code using 1 to 15 characters of  any type to identify the Item Matrix Group. The Matrix code cannot be  modified after it is defined. This field is optional. The system assigns  the Prefix value as the matrix code to the Matrix group when you do not  define a matrix code.


{:.note}
The drop-down of the Matrix Code displays  matrix group codes.


{:.example}
**100**  is the code that denotes the Matrix Group in this example.


**Prefix**
: The code of an individual matrix item is made up  of a combination of the elements defined in the later sections of this  wizard. The prefix is entered in this field. You can enter a unique code  of up to fifteen characters in the Prefix field. This is a mandatory field.
: Specify a Prefix for your Item Matrix.


{:.example}
The prefix is **87456**  in this example.


{:.note}
It is always better to create a Prefix of  shorter length to control the length of the matrix item code.


**Description**
: Enter a suitable description for your matrix group  spanning up to 40 characters. This is a mandatory field.


{:.example}
ShopSmart Shirts


**Element Separator**
: Select a suitable element separator from the drop-down  to separate the Group Code, Prefix and Description. Every matrix item  will have the element separator you have chosen to distinguish between  the prefix and the attribute code. Select **None**  if you do not want to use an element separator.


{:.example}
**87456-003-s**  denotes the Prefix 87456 and Color code (Chestnut) and Size (s). Item  codes can only have a maximum length of 15 characters. Â Using  the **None** option provides you with  the ability to configure more complex matrix items.
: The allowed characters for Element Separators are:


| Element Separator | Description |
| None | No Element Separator |
| - | Hyphen |
| / | Front slash |
| \* | Asterisk |
| # | Hash |
| : | Colon |
| ; | Semi-colon |
| , | Comma |
| \_ | Underscore |
| < | Lesser than |
| > | Greater than |

: If the item code exceeds more than 15 characters  including the separators, a warning message displays.


Element Description
: Three options are available to include the **Element Description** that you specify  for the matrix item:


**Include in Item description**
: This option includes the matrix element in the item  description.


**Include in extended sales description**
: This option includes the element description as  extended sales description in the sales document.


**Include in both**
: This option includes the element description in  both the item description and in the extended sales document.
