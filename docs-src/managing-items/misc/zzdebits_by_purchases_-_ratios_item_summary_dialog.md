title: Debits by Purchases - Ratios
---


The total vendor returns as displayed in the **Debit 
 (qty)** field divided by the total purchases as displayed in the  **Purchase (qty)** field is displayed.  This ratio represents the percentage of purchases that have been returned.  A more than acceptable rate means the quality of vendors needs to be looked  into.
