title: Recalculate The Price of Each Item in The Kit
---


Select this option to recalculate the price of each item in the kit  based on any special pricing rules you have set up. **Everest**  calculates the least price of each item after considering all the pricing  options you may have set up, like Customer Level pricing, Quantity pricing  etc. and displays the same in the sales document when the kit is added.  When you retrieve the kit, the sales document will display all the items  and their recalculated prices.
