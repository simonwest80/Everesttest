title: Cost Average Amount
---


The average cost per unit of purchase. The cost is arrived at by dividing  the total purchase value by the total quantity of purchase.


This cost may be different from the average cost of the items in stock.


The cost displayed in this field is different from the average cost  in the following cases:

- The item's  purchase measure is not a single unit.



{:.example}
If  the purchase measure is a dozen, the average cost displayed in this field  is per unit whereas in the **Item** profile,  the average cost per dozen is displayed.

- In case of  serialized items, the average cost of purchase may be different from the  average cost of items in stock.



{:.example}
If 5 units of a serialized item is purchased at the following prices:


5, 10, 20, 25 and 30


Total cost of purchase = 90


Average cost of purchase = 18 (90/5)


If the first two items are sold the average cost displayed for the item  in stock is 25 (75/3) while the average cost of purchase remains the same.
