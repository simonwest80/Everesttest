title: Factored Averge Cost
---


The average cost of the item is displayed in this field, if Factor cost  is enabled. This field cannot be edited. The average cost is arrived at  by including the unrecoverable portion of the purchase tax. This cost  includes the factor percentage/amount. Average Cost is the current weighted  average cost of the item. It is computed by adding the value of a purchase  to the value of quantity in stock and dividing the sum by the sum of the  quantity in stock and quantity purchased. Average cost is thus computed  using the following formula:


Average Cost = (Value of Purchase + Value of Quantity in Stock)/(Quantity  purchased + Quantity in Stock)
