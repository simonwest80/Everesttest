title: Price Differential for Customer Levels
---


Price Differential is defined as a percentage or a flat amount. By default,  this percentage or flat amount is applicable to all the customers who  purchase the item. You can specify the price differential (as a percentage  or a flat amount) for each customer level separately. All customer levels  that have been defined are displayed in the **Price 
 Differential for Customer Levels** section.


The price differential for each customer level is different from the  price to which the differential is applied.


{:.example}
You specify  a price differential of flat $2 in general to upgrade from A to B. Item  A's price is $10 but the price for level 1 is $8. When upgrade is done  for customer in level 1, the upgrade price will be $10 (8+2). For customers  at level none, the upgrade price will be $12 (10+2).


Now, if you specify a price differential for level 1 at $1.75 instead  of $2; the price for customer level 1 will be taken for such customers  AND the price differential for level 1 if it exists will be used; so in  this case, it would be 9.75 (8+1.75).

- If you have  selected any of the first five options in the **Percentage/Amount**  field, the **Percent** and **Amount**  columns will be displayed in this section.



**Percent**
: Enter a percentage for each customer level in the  **Percent** column. It is not mandatory  to enter a percentage for every customer level.


**Amount**
: The amount of price differential is calculated and  displayed in the **Amount** field  for each customer level. You cannot edit this column.

- If you have  selected the **Flat Amount (+ or -)**  option, only the **Amount** column  is displayed.



**Amount**


Enter a flat amount for each customer level.
