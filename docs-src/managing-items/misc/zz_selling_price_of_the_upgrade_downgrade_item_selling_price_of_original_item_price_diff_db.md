title: (Selling price of the upgrade/downgrade item - Selling price of original item)
---


If the price difference has to be calculated as a percentage of the  difference between the selling price of the upgrade/downgrade item and  the selling price of the original item, select this option and enter the  percentage in the **Percentage**/**Amount** field.


The result of applying the percentage on the base value will be displayed  in the **Result** field. You can also  mention a negative percentage (in case of downgraded items).


{:.example}
**If the selling price of the original item  is $200 and the selling price of the upgraded item is $300, and the percentage  differential is given as 10%, the **Result**  field (i.e. the price differential amount) displays $10. The price for  the upgraded item would be the selling price of the original item + price  differential amount. If the differential is negative, the formula automatically  takes care of it.**
