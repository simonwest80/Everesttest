title: Vendor related information
---


Allows you to define vendor related information for the item. The vendor  related information is mentioned below:


**Vendor**
: Select the vendor from whom the item is purchased.  You can associate more than one vendor with an item. In such case, you  should mark one vendor as primary vendor. The rest of the vendors will  become secondary vendors. If there is only one vendor then that vendor  will automatically be marked as primary vendor. You can modify the primary  vendor at any point to time. You cannot select a vendor more than once  in this grid.


{:.note}
You can dissociate any vendor at any point  of time even if there is an open purchase order for the vendor.


**Vendor Name**
: This field will automatically get populated when  you select the Vendor.


**Purchase Measure**
: Select the measure in which the item is purchased  from the vendor. You can edit this field at any point of time. However,  after updating this field you should also update standard cost and vendor  last cost.


**Standard Cost**
: Specify the cost at which the item will be purchased  from the vendor. This is an editable field and by default it shows the  item’s standard cost. For a new item, Standard Cost equals Last Cost.


**Last Cost**
: Specify the last cost at which the item is purchased  from the vendor. This field will be updated every time an item is purchased  from the vendor in the measure associated with the vendor. This is an  editable field and by default it shows the item’s last cost.


**EOQ**
: Specify the economic order quantity that you want  to order from the vendor.  This  field will be in the purchase measure selected for the vendor. This is  an editable field and by default it will show zero value.


**Vendor Part Number**

**Lead Time**
: Specify the time required by the vendor to deliver  the goods in number of days. The default value is Unknown and is used  just for information.
