# Pending Debit Order Committed Browser


The **Pending Debit Order Committed**  browser displays a list of debit orders that contain the selected item.  The details of returns that you expect to make to vendors are thus provided.


Other debit order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in this browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Debit Committed** - The quantity of returns that you expect to make  to the vendor on the particular debit order is displayed, for all stock  areas.
- **Pending**  - The net quantity that has NOT yet been returned to the vendor is displayed.  Thus: Pending (quantity) = On Debit (quantity) - Shipped (quantity)
- **Shipped**  - The quantity that has already been returned on the debit order is displayed.  This column displays a value if the document is on back order.
- **Stock 
 Area** - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.



You can view the **Debit Order**  profile from this browser by selecting **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window**.
