title: Automatically display stock status indicators
---


When you select this option, the system automatically calculates  and displays stock status indicators (color and quantity) when an item  is retrieved into a customer document (Sales Quote, Sales Order, Sales  Invoice, Credit Quote, Credit Order, and Credit Memo). This option is  unchecked (NOT selected) by default when a new company is created.


To improve performance when adding line items to sales documents,  we recommend that you NOT select (disable) this option and use the **Stock Status Indicator** shortcuts available  in the sales documents to view this information only when required. To  access this information from a sales document, highlight a line item and  press **F10** to view the Stock Status  Indicator (path: From a sales document, select **Options**  > **Item** > **Stock 
 Status Indicator**). Â Press  **Shift + F10** to view the Stock  Status Indicator for all line items (path: From a sales document, select  **Options** > **All 
 Items** > **Stock Status Indicator 
 (All)**.
