title: Last Cost of Original Item
---


If the price difference has to be calculated as a percentage of the  last cost of the original item select this option and enter the percentage  in the **Percentage/Amount** field.


The result of applying the percentage on the base value will be displayed  in the **Result** field. You can also  mention a negative percentage (in case of downgraded items).


{:.example}
**If the last cost of the original item is $20  and the percentage differential is mentioned as 10%, the **Result**  field (i.e. the price differential amount) displays $22. The price for  the upgraded item would be the selling price of the original item + price  differential amount. If the differential is negative, the formula automatically  takes care of it.**
