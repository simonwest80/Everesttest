title: Price Differential
---


The price differential is the difference between the selling price of  the original item and its upgrade. When defining a price differential,  you can:

- Enter a flat  amount or
- Use a formula  to calculate the price differential.



{:.example}
Selling  Price of Item A +/- Price Differential = Selling Price of Item B (the  related item).


In order to specify a flat amount, enter the amount in **Price 
 Differential** field. Note that while specifying the price differential  for a downgrade item, the amount should be prefixed by a ‘-’ (minus) sign.  This is done to indicate that the price differential will have to be subtracted  from the selling price of the item being downgraded.
