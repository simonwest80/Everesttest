# The Pending Purchase Orders Browser


The **Pending Purchase** **Orders**  browser displays a list of purchase orders that contain the selected item.  Purchase Orders are displayed with respect to each location that is added  to the **Items** browser. The details  of items that you expect to receive from vendors are thus provided.


Other purchase order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  terms, and due date are also displayed in the **Pending 
 Purchase Orders** browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **Total 
 On Order** - The quantity that has been ordered (irrespective of  whether it has been partly received or not) is displayed.
- **Pending 
 On Order** - The quantity that has NOT yet been received on the order  is displayed. Thus:



Pending Quantity = On Order (quantity)  - Received (quantity)

- **Received** - The quantity that has already been received on the purchase order  is displayed. This column displays a value if the document is on back  order.
