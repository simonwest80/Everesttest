The **Pending Credit Order Committed**  browser displays a list of credit orders that contain the selected item.  The details of returns expected from customers are thus provided.


Other credit order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in this browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Credit Committed** - The quantity of returns expected from the customer  on the particular credit order is displayed, for all stock areas.
- **Pending**  - The net quantity that has NOT yet been received from the customer is  displayed. Thus: Pending (quantity) = On Credit (quantity) - Received  (quantity)
- **Received**  - The quantity that has already been returned on the credit order is displayed.  This column displays a value if the document is on back order.
- **Stock 
 Area** - The area to which the committed quantity is transferred  is displayed.
