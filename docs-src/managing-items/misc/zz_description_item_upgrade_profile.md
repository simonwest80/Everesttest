The description of the item selected in the **Related 
 Item Code** field will be displayed here. You can edit this field  if required. The **Related Items**  browser is updated with any change made to the description of a related  item.


{:.note}
If the description of the related item is changed in the **Related 
 Items** tab of an **Item** profile,  it will be used only when that item is retrieved into a document and is  replaced with the related item. It does not update the description in  the **Related** **Items**  tab for all those items where this item is specified as a related item.  You will have to manually edit such item descriptions if required.


{:.example}
Item code X with a description "80GB Hard Drive" is a related  item for items Y  and Z. Changing  the description of item code X  in  the **Related Items** tab of ITEM  Y to "80GB  Hard Drive (7500RPM)" will not automatically change the description  in the Related Items tab of items Z.   Also, the  **Item** profile for Item code X will  still display "80GB Hard Drive".


If required, you can manually change the description in the **Related 
 Items** tab by opening the **Item**  profile of item Z  and accessing the **Related Items**  tab.
