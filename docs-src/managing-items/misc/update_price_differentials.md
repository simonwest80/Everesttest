# Update Price Differentials


Whenever there is a difference in the price of an item and its upgrade,  the difference has to be entered either as a fixed price or can be arrived  at by specifying a formula.


Whenever there is a change in the cost (average cost or last cost),  or selling price of an upgraded item and the alternate item, you have  to re-apply the formula to calculate the new Price Differential. This  is a highly cumbersome and time-consuming process.


In order to simplify the process of updating the Price Differentials  during such circumstances, **Everest**  has provided with an **Update Price Differentials**  feature. This feature allows you to update the price difference for both  items and kits.
