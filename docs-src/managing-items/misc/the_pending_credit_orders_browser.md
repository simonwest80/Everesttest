# The Pending Credit Orders Browser


The **Pending Credit Orders** browser  displays a list of credit orders that contain the selected item. Purchase  Orders are displayed with respect to each location that is added to the  **Items** browser. The details of  returns expected from customers are thus provided.


Other credit order details such as the order date, cost of the item,  delivery method, terms, and due date are also displayed in the **Pending 
 Credit Orders** browser.


The following quantity columns are also displayed:

- **On 
 Credit** - The quantity of returns expected from the customer on  the particular credit order is displayed.
- **Pending** - The net quantity that has NOT yet been received from the customer  is displayed. Thus:



Pending (quantity) = On Credit (quantity)  - Received (quantity)

- **Received** - The quantity that has already been returned on the credit order  is displayed. This column displays a value if the document is on back  order.
