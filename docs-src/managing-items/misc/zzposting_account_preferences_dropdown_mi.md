title: Posting Account Preferences (Drop-down)
---


Specify an account selection methodology to be used for the  Item profile. You can specify accounts without setting up posting groups.  If you prefer to use posting groups (groups of accounts), instead of making  individual account selections, that option is also available.

- **Use 
 Accounts Based Upon Hierarchy** – Select this option if you would  like the system to use inventory accounts at the location level first  (if defined) and then at the company level (accounting defaults).
- **Use 
 Posting Groups** – Select this option if you would like to use Posting  Groups to define your accounts. If you select this option, you must enter  an “Inventory Posting Group” in the **Posting****Group** field that appears when  you make this selection. 
By default the Posting Group assigned to the category to which the  item belongs is associated with the item. You can change the Posting Group  in the **Item** profile.
You can define a Posting Group in the **Item**  profile as well as the **Category**  profile.
For existing items, this field is blank, indicating that the Posting  Group for the category to which the item belongs would be considered.  To override the Posting Group of the category, select a Posting Group  in this field.
- **Specify 
 Accounts** – Select this option if you would like to specify the  inventory control accounts to use for this Item. Click the ![]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/img/look_up_button_mi.gif) lookup button to view the related accounts that can be defined.  On the Accounts screen, select the Inventory Control Accounts that you  would like to define for this Category. Click **Apply**  and then click **OK** to apply your  selections.
