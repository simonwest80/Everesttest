title: Last Cost Row
---


After you select the parameter based on which to perform the item search  (by last cost), you must either:

- Specify the starting  value in the first field and the ending value in the second field beside  the **Last Cost** field. You must  specify both values if the parameter requires a range to be specified,  or
- Enter the value  in the first field, if the parameter requires one value to be specified.  The second field is disabled.
