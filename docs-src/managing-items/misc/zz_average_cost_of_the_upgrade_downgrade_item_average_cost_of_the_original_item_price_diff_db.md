title: Average cost of the upgrade/downgrade item - Average cost of the original item
---


If the price difference is calculated as a percentage of the difference  between the average cost of the upgrade/downgrade item and the average  cost of the original item select this option and enter the percentage  in the **Percentage/Amount** field.  The average cost includes the factor cost, if any.


The result of applying the percentage on the base value will be displayed  in the **Result** field. You can also  give a negative percentage (in case of downgraded items).


{:.example}
**If the average cost of the original item is  $200 and the average cost of the upgraded item is $300, and the percentage  differential is given as 10%, the **Result**  field (i.e. the price differential amount) displays $10. The price for  the upgraded item would be the selling price of the original item + price  differential amount. If the differential is negative, the formula automatically  takes care of it.**
