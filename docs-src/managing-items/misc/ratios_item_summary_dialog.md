# Ratios


Relevant ratios to help you in analyzing the purchase and sales of an  item are displayed in this section.


**Credits/Sales**
: The total customer returns as displayed in the **Credit (qty)** field divided by the total  sales as displayed in the **Sales (qty)**  field is displayed. This ratio indicates the percentage of your sales  that has been returned. A more than acceptable rate of return is a cause  for concern.


**Debits/Purchase**
: The total vendor returns as displayed in the **Debit (qty)** field divided by the total  purchases as displayed in the **Purchase 
 (qty)** field is displayed. This ratio indicates the percentage of  purchases that have been returned. A more than acceptable rate means the  quality of vendors needs to be looked into.


**Sales/Purchase**
: The total value of sales as displayed in the **Sales (qty)** field divided by the total  value of purchases as displayed in the **Purchase 
 (qty)** field is displayed. This ratio indicates the percentage of  the quantity purchased that has been sold. A low ratio would lead to an  inventory build up of the item and indicates that sales do not meet expectations.


**Debits/Credits**
: The total vendor returns as displayed in the **Debit (qty)** field divided by the total  customer returns as displayed in the **Credit 
 (qty)** field is displayed. This ratio is relevant in case of traded  items. In the case of traded items, when the customer returns an item  for defects etc the item is returned to the vendor who sold it.  This ratio indicates the quantity of items returned by customers that  was returned to vendors.
