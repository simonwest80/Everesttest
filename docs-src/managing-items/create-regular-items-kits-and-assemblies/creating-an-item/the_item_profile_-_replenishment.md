# The Item Profile - Replenishment


The **Replenishment** tab allows  you to specify replenishment planning details for all the items. You can  also provide replenishment planning details by location.


The Replenishment tab has two sub-tabs:

- [General  Tab]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/create-regular-items-kits-and-assemblies/creating-an-item/the_item_profile_replenishment_general_tab_mi.html)
- [Usage  Tab]({{site.mi_baseurl}}/create-regular-items-kits-and-assemblies/creating-an-item/the_item_profile_replenishment_usage_tab_mi.html)



Click on the above links for detailed information on the these tabs.


Details on these tabs can be automatically updated by the  **Everest Inventory 
 Planning Wizard** utility which takes the pain and guesswork out  of inventory management. It automatically calculates minimum, maximum,  and reorder quantities based on your items’ sales and purchase histories  and settings that you configure including usage quantity, lead time, and  safety stock. It allows you to classify items according to the quantity  on hand, profitability, cost, and price. The Everest Inventory Planning  Wizard even has special considerations for seasonal items along with your  regular items. This improves the efficiency of your Purchasing staff by  eliminating the need to export sales data, analyze it, and then re-import  it to set replenishment points.
