Set the Kit Pricing Details


Follow the steps below to set up the pricing details for  your kit:

- Open the Item profile  for the kit you want to discount.
- Select the **Details - Pricing** tab.
- In the **Type**  field, select **Reset item prices to zero 
 and display the total price of the kit on a total line**. This option  resets all individual item prices in the kit to zero, and displays the  total price of the kit according to the options displayed.
- Select the **Use pricing defined in the Sales Tab to determine 
 the total price** option. This option displays the sales price of  the item kit as specified in the **Sales**  tab of the Item profile. When retrieved in a sales document, the kit is  the first line item with the prices defined in its profile. The system  displays zero prices for the individual items.

- Click **OK**.
- Save the Item profile.



When you create a sales order for a customer with the defined  customer level, the kit price decreases by the appropriate discount depending  upon the quantity purchased.


In the following sales order example, the customer purchased  two kits.


Kit Discount = ($1,000 per kit x 2 kits) x .25 discount (25%)  = $2,000 x .25 = **$500**


Kit Price with Discount = $2,000 - $500 = **$1,500**
