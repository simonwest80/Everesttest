# {{page.title}}

For convenience, each main topic have been divided into two parts. The first section delineates the functional aspects, and the second helps you accomplish a task in **Everest** system with step-by-step instructions. The functional aspects include advantages of using a feature, real-life examples, back-end processes that take place when you use a function, and detailed accounting entries wherever required.

This format is followed throughout the online help for all the relevant topics, with some exceptions. Functional aspects and step-by-step instructions have been combined for topics which are self-explanatory and do not require much background information.
