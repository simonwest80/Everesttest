The Online Help provides information on **Everest** commands, functions, concepts and processes.

**Displaying Context Sensitive Help**

**Everest** provides context-sensitive Online Help. You can press the **F1** key to display help information about any active window or dialog box in **Everest**. Alternatively, you can click the help toolbar icon ![]({{site.aoh_baseurl}}/img/Help_icon_aoh.gif) to display this information. Some screens do not have the help icon and instead contain a large ![]({{site.aoh_baseurl}}/img/Large_help_button_aoh.gif)" **Help** button. To get context sensitive help for a particular field, click the ![]({{site.aoh_baseurl}}/img/Whats_this_small_icon_aoh.gif) or ![]({{site.aoh_baseurl}}/img/Whats_this_icon_aoh.gif) button and then the field. However, help is not available for the fields that are not enabled.

{:.note}
The hyperlinks in the context-sensitive help do not function if your Internet Explorer version is lower than 6.0. To resolve this problem, please install Critical Update 811630.
