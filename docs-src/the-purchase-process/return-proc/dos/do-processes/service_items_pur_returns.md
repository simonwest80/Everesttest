# Track Service Items


You can keep track of items that are received from vendors after service  or repairs. You can retrieve items into debit orders from ‘stock’ type  of stock areas, and toggle the item type to 'service', to denote that  these represent items returned from service. You can also use the **Document** **Alias**  option to track service orders placed with from vendors.

- From the main  menu bar, select **Purchasing** >  **Other** **Documents**  > **Debit** **Order**.  You will see the **Debit** **Orders**  browser.
- From the **Debit Orders** browser, select **Options**  > **New** > **In 
 New Window**. You will see the **Debit 
 Order** profile.
- Retrieve the  item code into the document.
- Change the  item type to service. To change the item type to service, click the **Type** column for the line item and press  the **Spacebar** key.
- Attach/Commit  the items returned from repair or service.



For service items, the amount in the **Cost**  column represents the value of service charges. If the item is under warranty  and no costs are associated, item cost should be zero.


Attach serial number from the ‘stock' type of stock areas for serialized  items returned by vendors. For non-serialized items, tracked for lots,  attach the item from stock.
