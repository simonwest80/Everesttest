# Partial Returns


You can create partial debits against a single order to account for  orders that are returned in stages.


{:.example}
If you intend to return five computers, but  actually return only three, you can create a memo for the three items.  The debit order is assigned the status ‘Backorder’ until the remaining  items are returned.


You can view this status on the document profile and in **Status**  column of the **Debit Orders** browser.  This status is assigned until the remaining items are returned when the  status changes to 'Closed'.
