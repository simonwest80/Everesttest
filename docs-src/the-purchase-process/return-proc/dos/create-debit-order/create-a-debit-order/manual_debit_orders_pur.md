# Manual Debit Orders


Manual debit orders are created when you create an entry in a payment  journal debiting the vendor with the entry type 'Miscellaneous Deposit'.  The document number you enter is prefixed with **M**  to denote it is a manual Debit order. If the document number is left blank,  the sequence number for manual debit orders for the logged in location  or sub-location is used.


If sequence numbers are not assigned to the logged in location or sub-location,  the sequence number assigned to the default location (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Defaults** > **Accounting**  > **Miscellaneous** tab > **Default Location** field) is used.


You can make modifications to manual debit orders in the same manner  as system documents.

**View Manual Debit Orders**
: You can view manual debit orders from the **Debit Orders** browser. Manual debit orders  have a **DO#** that is prefixed with  “M”.


**Modify Manual Debit Orders**
: You can modify manual debit orders from the **Debit Orders** profile just as you would  with system documents. This is the preferred method for making manual  debit order modifications since only limited modifications are possible  from the payment journal.
