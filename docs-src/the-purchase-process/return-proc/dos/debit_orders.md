# Debit Orders


The debit order is the second document generated in the purchase return  process. The debit order:

- Is created  when the items to be returned to a vendor have been identified.
- Identifies  the exact items to be returned or the stock area from which it is to be  returned.
- Helps in materials  planning (the quantities to be returned and their expected return dates  are considered when assessing free stock).
- Is also used  to record the dispatch of items to a vendor for repairs or replacement.



It is not mandatory to create the debit order; you can directly create  a debit memo.


{:.note}
The debit order is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when you create a debit  order.
