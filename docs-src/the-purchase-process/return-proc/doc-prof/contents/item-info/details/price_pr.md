# Item Cost


The **Item** **Cost** column displays the cost at which the vendor accepts the return.


Change the item cost, if necessary. It shows the cost from the **Last Cost** field in the Item profile  for the selected Unit of Measure (UOM). If the **Last 
 Cost** is not defined in the **Item**  profile, this field defaults to zero. Â Enter  the item cost in the cost decimal accuracy of the item.


{:.note}
If you want to change the default unit of  measure, the cost decimal accuracy, or the quantity decimal accuracy,  you need additional security rights.
