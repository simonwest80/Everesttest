# Retrieve an Item Kit


The **Retrieve** option is used  to add item kits to the document. If an item kit is retrieved, then the  item codes of all the kit components along with their respective prices  are added to the Item Details Grid. The item code for the original kit  cannot be viewed.


You can retrieve only one kit at a time using the **Retrieve**  option.

If an item kit for a P-III computer is selected,  then the item codes for each kit component such as the Processor, Monitor  and Keyboard are added to the item grid.
