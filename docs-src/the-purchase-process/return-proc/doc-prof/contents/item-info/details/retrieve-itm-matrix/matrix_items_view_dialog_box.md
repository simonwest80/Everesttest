# The Matrix Items View Dialog Box


The **Matrix Items View** dialog  box displays a matrix of all combinations for the item matrix. This dialog  box allows you to select and configure the information of the matrix items  to be included in the purchase document.


{:.example}
If you select an item matrix for Beefy Haynes  T-shirts, a matrix with the size and color combinations is displayed.  Enter the quantity of purchase for size "Large" and color "White"  and size "Medium" and color "Red". The item codes  for these combinations are added to the item grid.


**Horizontal Selection**
: Select the attribute that must be displayed in the  horizontal axis of the **Matrix Grid**.  This is the primary attribute that you want to view the matrix for. All  the elements defined for the selected attribute are displayed horizontally  in the first row below its title.


{:.example}
To view all the colors a particular size T-shirt is available in, select  "Color" here.

Each cell in the grid represents the combination of the vertical and  horizontal attributes. Combinations not yet activated (as items) are disabled  or grayed out.


**Change**
: The **Change**  and **To** fields allow you to enter  a single value for all combinations in the matrix group.
: To populate the cells in a matrix with the same  data, select the parameter in the **Change**  field and enter the value in the **To**  field. All cells will be populated with the same value.
