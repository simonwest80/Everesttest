# Document Notes


Notes can be attached to purchase return  documents to keep track of important messages or information pertaining  to the document (path: Purchase Return Document profile > **Options**  > **Document** > **Document****Notes**). The note attached to the  document will not be printed along with the document.


{:.example}
You can attach a note to a quote on the date  of negotiations with the vendor, about returns you expect to make.


You can also set up flow control preferences to:

- **Popup 
 and first show notes attached to the document prior to opening it**  (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow****Control** > **Documents**  > **Flow** **Control****Setup** > **Popups**  tab).
- **Copy 
 the notes attached to an order to receipt or invoice or attached to a 
 receipt to invoice (when converting an order to receipt/invoice or receipt 
 to invoice)** (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Documents** > **Flow****Control** **Setup**  > **Popups** tab).



{:.note}
If you select this option notes attached to a quote  will be copied to the order when it is converted to an order and notes  attached to an order will be copied to a memo.
