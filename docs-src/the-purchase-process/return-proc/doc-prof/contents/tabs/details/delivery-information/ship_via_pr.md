# Ship Via


The **Ship Via** field allows you  to specify the delivery method used for the item return shipment. Whenever  a new purchase return document is created, the default delivery method  specified in the **Delivery** **Method** field (path: **Purchasing**  > **Vendor** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Miscellaneous**  tab) is displayed. You can select another delivery method if required.


The delivery method is also used to:

- Estimate the  freight due on the shipment.
- To track shipments.



{:.example}
If the carrier for the delivery method is  Federal Express, you can track the shipment using the tracking number.
