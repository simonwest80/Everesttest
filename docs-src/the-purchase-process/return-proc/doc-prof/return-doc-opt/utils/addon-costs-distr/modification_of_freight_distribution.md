# Modify Add-on Costs Distribution

- You can modify the add-on costs distributed on  a purchase/debit order at any time till it is received/invoiced.


{:.note}
It is not possible to edit the add-on  cost for a purchase order, once if it has been received/invoiced partially  or fully.
- If some ordered  items have been received/returned, changing the **Add-on 
 costs distribution** in the original document will not change the  add-on costs on the items already received/returned.
- You cannot modify  the add-on costs distributed on a saved debit memo
- You can modify  the add-on costs distributed on a saved purchase invoice. When you distribute  the costs on the Invoiced quantity, this creates entries in the Accounts  Payable and Purchase Price Variance accounts. When you distribute costs  on the Received on Invoice quantity, this creates entries in the Inventory  Control and Purchase Price Variance accounts.



When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, if the invoiced/received  on invoice quantity is less than the ordered quantity and you have add-on  costs distributed in the purchase order, the system asks if you want to  redistribute the add-on costs to reflect the cost for the invoiced/received  on invoice quantity. If you select **Yes**,  the add-on cost distribution profile displays so you can edit the costs.  If you select **No**, the add-on cost  does not change but the invoiced/received on invoice amount includes the  costs.


When you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, if the invoiced  quantity is less than the received quantity and you have add-on costs  distributed in the purchase receipt, the system asks if you want to redistribute  the add-on costs to reflect the cost for the invoiced quantity. If you  select **Yes**, the add-on cost distribution  profile displays so you can edit the costs. If you select **No**,  the add-on cost does not change but the invoiced amount includes the costs.
