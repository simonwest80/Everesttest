# Document Discount 


Companies often apply discounts to entire purchase documents  based upon the relationships they have with various vendors. The **Document Discount** option can be used  to quickly apply a global discount on all line items in the document (path:  Purchase Document profile > **Options**  > **Document** > **Document 
 Discount**).


For example, you can quickly add an 8% discount to all line  items in the purchase order using this option. It is not necessary to  add the discount manually to each line item.


**Discount**
: Use this option to specify a discount percentage  to be applied to all line items in the document.


**Exclude already reduced items**
: If you select this check box, the discount specified  in the **Discount** field is not applicable  to items that already have a discount specified.
