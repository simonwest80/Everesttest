# Vendor Tracking


The **Vendor** **Tracking**  option (path: Purchase Return Document profile > **Options**  > **Vendor** > **Vendor****Tracking**) allows you to access  tracking information for the vendor selected in the document.


You can also make relevant changes to the tracking selection.


{:.example}
If a vendor is tagged to 2 weeks lead time  in the tracking group ‘Lead Time for Supply’  and the lead time changes for an order, you change the tracking appropriately.
