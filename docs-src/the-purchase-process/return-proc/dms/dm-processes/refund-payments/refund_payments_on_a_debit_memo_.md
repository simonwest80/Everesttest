# Refund Payments on a Debit Memo


You may initially accept a refund from your vendor for items that you  return. Later on, you may decide to take another item in exchange for  the returned item. In this case, you would make either a full or partial  payment on the debit memo to the vendor.


You can pay your vendor through cash, check, or credit card. A credit  card payment is processed online only if you select the **Use 
 Payment Processor** option (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Accounting &gt; Payment Methods &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window &gt; Credit Card Processing** tab).

 Method** field.
- Enter the amount  to be paid in the **Amount** field  and click **OK**.
