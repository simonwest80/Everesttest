# Back End Processes - Refund Against a Debit Memo


When a refund is made against a debit memo, the following back end processes  occur:

- The vendor's  unposted amount (in the **Vendor's**  profile) increases by the amount of payment. The amount payable to the  vendor increases. When the payment journal for the payment is posted,  the unposted amount decreases and the posted amount increases by the amount  refunded. The amount payable to the vendor stays the same.



{:.example}
If the vendor's balance (amount payable to  vendor) after creating the debit memo is $1250; when you receive a refund  of $100, the vendor's account is credited and the balance increases to  $1350.

- The amount  paid on the debit memo increases. If the amount paid is applied to a purchase  order or purchase receipt, then the paid amount of these documents increases.
