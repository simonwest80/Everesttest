# Profit or Loss on Return


Profit or loss on return is calculated only for inventoried items.


**Serialized items**
: The profit or loss on return of a serialized item  is calculated using the following formula:
: (Item Cost - Discount) X Quantity Returned - Sum  of actual cost of items returned


{:.note}
If the return value exceeds the actual cost of items  returned, it is a profit on return; else it is a loss.


**Non-serialized items**
: (Item Cost - Discount) X Quantity Returned - (Average  cost at the time of return X Quantity of items returned)


{:.note}
If the return value exceeds the average cost of items  returned, it is a profit on return; else it is a loss.
