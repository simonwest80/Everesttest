# Reserve


You can convert a debit quote to a debit order by using the **Reserve**  option (path: **Purchase Quote** profile  > **Options &gt; Process &gt; Reserve**).  Once the debit order is created, the debit quote:

- Ceases to exist  as a system document
- Generates a debit  order with the status **Open**.
- Can no longer be  accessed through the **Debit** **Quotes** browser.
- The original debit  quote number is displayed as a reference number in the debit order that  has been created.
- The document number  for the new debit order is automatically generated by the system.
