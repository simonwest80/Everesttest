# Flowchart of the Purchase Process


In most cases you will convert a purchase order to a purchase receipt  to accept items into inventory and to a purchase invoice to make a payment  to the vendor. In those cases the process follows the flowchart below.


In some cases you may create a purchase receipt directly (without converting  from a purchase order). The flowchart for this situation is a bit different.
