# Recurring Purchase Documents


You can create recurring purchase documents only for non-inventoried  items.


Create a Recurring Purchase Order

- [Create  a purchase order]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/creating_purchase_orders.html) for the required vendor.



{:.note}
Recurrence patterns can be set if you add only non-inventoried  items to purchase orders.

- Define the  [Recurrence  Schedule]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/recur-pmnts/define-recurrence-pattern/define_a_recurrence_pattern_purchase_orders_purchase_contents.html).



When you save the recurrence details,  **Everest** creates as many purchase  orders as defined in the recurrence pattern.


{:.example}
If you create a purchase order for maintenance  for a year and the amount is due to be paid every month; **Everest**  creates 12 purchase orders. Tasks (using the **Contact****Manager** function) are also created  automatically with reminders to convert these purchase orders into invoices  on the scheduled dates.


Once the recurring purchase orders are created:

- They have to  be manually converted to purchase invoices on the due date. The **Contact** **Manager**  function gives you a reminder to that effect.
