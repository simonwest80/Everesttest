You can keep a purchase order pending while processing a subsequent  one.

You can process a recurring purchase order  for May before processing the one in the same series for April.


You can keep track of purchase orders that are not processed on the  due date by using the date filter "This Year-to-date" in the  **Purchase** **Orders**  browser.
