**Freight Estimation**
: **Everest**  allows you to compute freight using the Everest Freight Estimator.
: Freight is computed on an item only if the **Include in Freight Calculation** option  is selected in the **Item** profile  (path: **Inventory** > **Items**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Purchase** tab).

**Add-on Costs Distribution**
: You can distribute the freight payable on items  received and other costs on inventoried items through the **Add-on 
 Costs Distribution** utility (path: **Purchase****Receipt** profile > **Options**  > **Utility** > **Add-on 
 Costs Distribution**).

**Processing a Drop Ship Purchase Receipt**
: When a drop ship purchase order is converted to  a purchase receipt, and you receive items on the receipt, the system prompts  you to assign the received items to the sales order and to create a sales  invoice.
