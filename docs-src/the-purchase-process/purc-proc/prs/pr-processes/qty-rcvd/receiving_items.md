# Receiving Items


When you process a purchase order to a purchase receipt, the **Ordered**  column for a line item displays the quantity ordered at the time of conversion.  The **Received** column displays the  quantity committed on the order, if any. If quantity is not committed,  it displays the quantity ordered and not received.


You can set preferences to:

- **Set 
 the quantity received value to zero when converting a purchase order to 
 a purchase receipt or purchase invoice** (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous 
 &gt; Others** > **Others 1**  tab).
