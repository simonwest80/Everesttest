# The Purchase Function


The purchase function involves decisions and processes required for  procuring products and services to operate a business. The purchase cycle  begins with the initiation of a purchase requisition by the department  that requires the products or services. It ends with the receipt of items  through a purchase receipt and payment for the items through a purchase  invoice.


If defective items have to be returned to the vendor, or claims are  made for poor services, the purchase process extends to the purchase returns  process.
