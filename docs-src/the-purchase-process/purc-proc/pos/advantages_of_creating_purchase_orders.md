# Advantages of Creating Purchase Orders


Although a purchase receipt can be directly created when the items are  received, creating a purchase order has the following advantages:

1. **Materials 
 Planning -** Helps track the items on order and backorder, and the  expected dates of delivery. This allows you to plan the usage of your  materials and make decisions on placing new orders.
- **Receiving 
 items for approval** **-** You  can receive items against a purchase order without including it into stock.  This helps you keep track of items received that are awaiting inspection.
- **Supplier 
 payments** **-** You can keep  track of orders against which deposits are made.
- **Tracking 
 lead-time for supplies** - Accounting for receipts against the order  helps track the lead-time between order date and delivery date.
