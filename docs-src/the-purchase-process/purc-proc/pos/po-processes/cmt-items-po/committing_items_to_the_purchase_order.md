# Commit Items to a Purchase Order


Inventoried items can be committed to a purchase order when:

- The vendor  ships the items on order and informs you about the shipment. Entering  the item quantities shipped by the vendor in the **Committed**  column helps you in materials planning as these items are likely to be  received immediately.
- You physically  receive the items but do not take the items into stock until it is inspected  and approved.



You cannot commit items on orders belonging to discontinued vendors.
