# Adding to Items Committed


To commit additional quantities of an item, enter the new quantity committed  in the **Committed** column. The additional  quantity is assigned to the stock area to which other items are committed.


If the item is serialized, new serial numbers are generated for the  additional quantity once you save the purchase order.
