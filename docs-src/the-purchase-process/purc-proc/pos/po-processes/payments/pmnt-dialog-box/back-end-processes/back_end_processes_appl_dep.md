# Back End Processes - Payment Against a Purchase Order


When you make a payment against a purchase order, the following back  end processes occur:

- The vendor's  unposted amount (as viewed in the **Vendor**  profile) reduces by the amount of payment. The amount payable to the vendor  is reduced. When the payment journal for the payment is posted, the unposted  amount is incremented with, and the posted amount reduced by the amount  paid. The amount payable to the vendor stays the same.
- The amount  paid on the purchase order increases.
