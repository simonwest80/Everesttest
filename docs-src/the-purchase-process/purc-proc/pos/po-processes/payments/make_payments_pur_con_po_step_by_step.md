# Advance Payments


Vendors often require deposits to be made along with purchase orders.  You can make payments against an order by using the **Payment 
 &gt; Pay** option from the **Purchase 
 Order** profile.


{:.note}
You cannot make payments against closed purchase orders.


![]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/img/steps.gif)To make payments against a document, do the  following:

- From the purchase  document profile, select **Options** > **Payment** > **Pay**. You will see the [**Payment** dialog box]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/po-processes/payments/pmnt-dialog-box/the_payment_dialog.html).



{:.note}
The **Pay**  option is enabled only against an existing purchase order or purchase  invoice. To create an order/invoice and make payments against it, save  the order/invoice and then select the option.


When you click the **Pay** option,  **Everest** checks if there are pending  transactions in the **Batch Payment Process**  browser for that document. If pending transactions are found, **Everest**  prompts you whether you want to process existing batch payments or receive  a new payment. The prompt also displays the total value of all pending  batch payments for the document.


Select **Process existing batch payments**  to view the **Batch Payment Process**  browser from where you can process the payment. To receive a new payment,  you should have appropriate security rights.
