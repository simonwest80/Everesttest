# Comparison - Cancel and Close a Purchase/Debit Quote


This section provides a comparison between cancelling and closing a  purchase/debit order:

- Orders that cannot  be cancelled can be marked as closed. An order cannot be cancelled when  it has a payment history or when it is a back order.
- When an order is  cancelled, the entire order is annulled and it reverts to a purchase/debit  quote. Closing an order merely marks the order as closed, and these orders  can be viewed in the **Shipped Purchase/Debit 
 Orders** browser.
