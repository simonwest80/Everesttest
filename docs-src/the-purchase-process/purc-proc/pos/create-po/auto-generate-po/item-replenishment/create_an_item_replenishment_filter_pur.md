# Create an Item Replenishment Filter


You can create a filter for the item or group of items to be automatically  replenished.


| ![]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) | A company sells computers and creates filters  for item replenishment of automated purchases based on lead time. They  have the following filters: “Items with 1-2 Day Lead Times”, “Items with  3-4 Day Lead Times”, “Items with 4-5 Day Lead Times”, and “Items with  Lead Times 6 Days and Over”.<br/><br/><br/>{:.note}<br/>This is analogous to creating separate order  books based on lead time. |

 Selection** tab, indicate which items to include in the **Item 
 Replenishment** browser list.
