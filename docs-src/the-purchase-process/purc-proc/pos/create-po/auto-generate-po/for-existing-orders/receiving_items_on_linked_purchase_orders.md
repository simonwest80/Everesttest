# Receive Items on Linked Purchase Orders


When you convert a linked purchase order to a receipt and save it, you  are prompted to assign the items to the linked sales order. Assigning  items to the linked sales order indicates that these quantities are committed  to the sales order.


If you click **Yes**, you are further  prompted to convert the sales order into an invoice.


{:.note}
If the purchase order contains line items  that pertain to more than one sales order, you will not receive this prompt.


Click **Yes** to bring up the linked  sales order and convert it to an invoice.
