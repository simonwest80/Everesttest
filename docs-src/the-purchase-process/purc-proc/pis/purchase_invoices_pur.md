# Purchase Invoices


The purchase invoice is a new document created to separate the process  of receiving inventory from the process of paying vendors. Purchase receipts  will assign received items into inventory while purchase invoices will  pay vendors for those items and services.


In previous versions of Everest, purchase receipts received items into  inventory and handled your accounts payable to vendors. In Everest Version  4.0 or later, these two functions are separate and addressed by the two  separate documents. You can now only make payments using a purchase invoice,  and although the system allows you to assign inventory on a purchase invoice  ideally you will only use a purchase receipt for that function.

**In the new process you can:**

- convert a purchase  order to a purchase receipt
- convert the same  purchase order to a purchase invoice
- convert a purchase  receipt to a purchase invoice only if the receipt was created directly  (without first creating a purchase order)



**The change is intended to address two primary  issues:**

- warehouse staff  will now only see information pertinent to their department
- accounts payable  staff can now pay vendors without a vendor invoice



The purchase invoice is now the last document in the purchase process  and is the base document for accounting for the value of the purchases.


{:.note}
The purchase invoice is a final document.  Inventory values, vendor balances, and accounts payable update based on  the invoice. Accounting entries automatically generate when you create  a purchase invoice.


**You can use a purchase invoice to:**

- Apply deposits  made on an order or adjust a debit memo against amounts due to the vendor.
- Update last cost  of items.
- Distribute freight  payable on items to the item value.
- Account for payables  to vendors.
