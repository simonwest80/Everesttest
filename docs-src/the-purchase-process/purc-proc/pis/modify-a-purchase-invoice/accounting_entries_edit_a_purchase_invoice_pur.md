# Accounting Entries - Edit a Purchase Invoice


The accounting processes that occur when you edit a purchase invoice  depend on the purchase invoiceâ€™s FOB Type. In addition, the process differs  for different scenarios.


{:.note}
- When the system  debits or credits the Accrued Purchases account with the balance of the  Accrued Purchase account for a multicurrency transaction, if the variance  in base or multicurrency is zero the system debits/credits the variance  to the gain or loss accounts defined in the accounting defaults.
- Changes to  the item cost occur when you edit the basic item cost, the discount applied,  the taxes, or any add-on costs.
