**Freight Estimation**
: **Everest**  allows you to compute freight using the Everest Freight Estimator.
: Freight is computed on an item only if the **Include in Freight Calculation** option  is selected in the **Item** profile  (path: **Inventory** > **Items**  > **Options** > **Edit**  > **In New Window** > **Purchase** tab).

**Add-on Costs Distribution**
: You can distribute the freight payable on items  invoiced and other costs on inventoried items through the **Add-on 
 Costs Distribution** utility (path: **Purchase****Invoice** profile > **Options**  > **Utility** > **Add-on 
 Costs Distribution**).

**Processing a Drop Ship Purchase Invoice**
: When a drop ship purchase order is converted to  a purchase invoice, and you receive items on the invoice, the system prompts  you to assign the received items to the sales order and to create a sales  invoice.

**Generate Debit Order**
: Create a debit order directly from the purchase  invoice. You must save the purchase invoice before creating a debit order.

**Reduce Document Value Below Paid Amount**
: After paying the full amount of the purchase invoice  to the vendor, if you reduce the value of the document, say by changing  the tax code, **Everest** informs  you that you have overpaid the document. You can choose to save the document  with a negative balance, and apply the overpaid amount to another purchase  order or invoice.


**Update the New Invoice**
: Make updates to the line item information.
