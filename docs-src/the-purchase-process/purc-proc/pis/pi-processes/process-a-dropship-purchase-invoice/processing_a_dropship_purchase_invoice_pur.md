# Process a Dropship  Purchase Invoice


When a dropship purchase order is converted to a purchase invoice, and  you receive items on the invoice, the system prompts you to assign the  received items to the sales order and to create a sales invoice.


**You have the following options:**

- Assign received  items to the original sales order and create a sales invoice
- Assign received  items to the original sales order and don't create a sales invoice
- Don't assign received  items to the sales order (this will break the link with the sales order)



If **all** of  the items are committed/shipped on the linked sales order and then you  try to receive the items on a purchase invoice, the system indicates that  you must break the link to the sales order in order to receive the items.  You may select **Yes** to break the  link and receive the items, or **No**  to leave the link intact and thus not receive items on this purchase invoice.  If you choose **No**, you must create  a new purchase receipt or invoice to accept the items independent of the  dropship order.


If **some**  of the items are committed/shipped on the linked sales order and then  you try to receive the items on a purchase invoice, the system asks if  you want to commit the backordered quantity on the sales order. You may  select **Yes** to commit the items  or **No** to leave the backorder unfilled.
