# Advantages of Creating a Purchase Quote


Although you can create a purchase order without creating a purchase  quote, there are certain advantages in creating a quote.

- **Comparative 
 analysis of vendor quotations** - The purchase quote records vendor  information, product information, terms of the purchase and other details  for each vendor quotation. This allows you to compare and analyze quotes.
- **Record 
 vendor negotiations** - Important points in the negotiations can  be recorded as a note in the quote.
- **Manage 
 vendor contacts** - The purchase quote is the basis for negotiations  with the vendor. It helps retrieve the details of the quote during conversations  or contacts with the vendor. The **Everest**  Contact Manager allows you to associate tasks and appointments with a  specified quote.
- **Minimize 
 data entry at the time of creating purchase orders** - When a purchase  quote is converted to an order, the information in the purchase quote  flows into the purchase order thus reducing data entry for order creation.
