# Purchase Quotes


The purchase quote is the first document generated in the purchase process.  The purchase quote:

- Records quotation  details received from vendors.
- Helps the purchasing  department evaluate quotes from various vendors and place an order against  the best quote.



The information in the purchase quote flows through the purchase order,  purchase receipt, and purchase invoice. You can directly create a purchase  order, purchase receipt, or purchase invoice without creating a purchase  quote.


{:.note}
The purchase quote is an intermediate or pending  document. Accounting entries are not generated when a purchase quote is  created.
