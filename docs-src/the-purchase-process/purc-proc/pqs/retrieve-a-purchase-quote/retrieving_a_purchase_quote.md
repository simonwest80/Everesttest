# Retrieve a Purchase Quote


Once a purchase quote has been converted to a purchase order, it can  no longer be viewed in the **Purchase****Quotes** browser.


You can however view it by retrieving it. To retrieve a purchase quote,  you must cancel the purchase order. The purchase order then reverts to  the purchase quote and can be viewed from the **Purchase****Quotes** browser.
