# Vendor Notes


You can attach notes to a **Vendor**  profile to keep track of information pertaining to the vendor. You can  also set up preferences to:

- Automatically  popup the notes  attached to a particular vendor by selecting the **Popup 
 Comments on Document** option (path: **Purchasing**  > **Vendors** > **Options** > **Edit** > **In New Window** > **Miscellaneous**  tab).
- Automatically  popup the notes  attached to any vendor, whenever a document is opened. To do this, select  the **Popup and first show notes attached 
 to the respective customer or vendor associated with the document prior 
 to opening it** option (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Documents** > **Popups**  tab). If you select this option, the **Popup 
 comments on document** checkbox in ALL vendor profiles and also for  newly created profiles will be checked and disabled. It is recommended  that you select this option only if you always want to view the comments  before selecting a vendor on a document.



{:.note}
You can edit vendor notes only from the **Vendor**'s profile.
