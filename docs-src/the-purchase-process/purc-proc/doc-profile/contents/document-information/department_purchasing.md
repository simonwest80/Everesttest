# Location/Sub-Location


The **Loc/Sub-Loc** field in a purchase  document displays the location or sub-location to which the document belongs.  This field defaults to the login location/sub-location when a new quote,  order, receipt, or invoice is created. You can change the location or  sub-location.


This field helps you to keep track of purchase documents by location/sub-location  and print reports required for management information purposes.


{:.example}
You  can generate a report of all purchase quotes raised from the retail department  to review the purchase requirements of the location/sub-location.


Address, Logo and Sequence Numbers


The location or sub-location details are  required to print your address and logo on the document. Since location/sub-locations  do not have separate sequence numbers, addresses and logos, if a location/sub-location  is selected, the sub-location's location details are used.


Processed Documents


As documents are converted from one type to another (quote, order, receipt,  invoice), the location/sub-location specified in the original document  is carried throughout. You can change the location/sub-location before  posting the purchase journal for the purchase invoice.


Different Location/Sub-Location for Vendor and Document


When the location/sub-location assigned to the vendor in the **Vendor**  profile (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous** tab)  is different from that of the document, **Everest**  prompts you with a message to that effect, asking you whether you want  to change it. You can choose to change the document's location/sub-location  by clicking 'Yes'.


{:.note}
You can set a preference to **Allow 
 users to open only those purchasing documents which belong to his/her 
 default location/sub-location** in the **Documents** dialog box **** (path: **File** > **Setup** > **Preferences** > **Flow Control** > **Documents** > **Miscellaneous** > **Others &gt; Others 2** tab).
