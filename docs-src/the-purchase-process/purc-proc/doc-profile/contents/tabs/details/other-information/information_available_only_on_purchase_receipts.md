**Tax Invoice Date**

**Claimed**
: The **Claimed**  option indicates whether GST/VAT has been claimed on the document and  cannot be edited. The **Claimed**  check box will be updated if you mark the purchase receipt/invoice as  claimed in the I**nput Claim PI Browser**.  While marking the purchase receipts/invoices as claimed, if the Vendor’s  tax invoice date has NOT been specified on the purchase receipt/invoice,  **Everest** updates the **Tax 
 invoice date** field with the login date prior to saving the purchase  receipt/invoice.
