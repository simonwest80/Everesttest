# Add-on Amount


This display-only field indicates the total Add-on Amount (if available  in the document) regardless of the FOB type. It updates every time you  make a change that affects the add-on amount.. You may click on the amount  in this field to open the **Add-on Costs 
 Distribution dialog** box.


{:.note}
In the case of a purchase invoice with the  type FOB Origin and where no quantity has been received in the purchase  invoice, the field displays $0.00 because you cannot include add-on costs.
