# Expiry Date


The **Expiry Date** field indicates:

- The date as on  which the prices quoted for a purchase quote are valid.
- The date before  which the vendor must confirm the order fulfillment, for a purchase order.



{:.note}
A quote or order may be converted to an order,  receipt, or invoice even if it is past the expiry date. The **Expiry 
 Date** field is enabled only in purchase quotes.


This field helps in filtering expired quotes so that they can be purged  from the **Purge**  utility.
