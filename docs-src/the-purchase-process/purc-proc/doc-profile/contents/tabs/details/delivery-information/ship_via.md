# Ship Via


Whenever you create a new purchase document, the default delivery method  specified in the **Delivery Method**  field (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors 
 &gt; Options &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window &gt; Miscellaneous** tab)  is displayed in this field. You can select another delivery method if  required.

{:.note}
In case of drop shipments, the **Ship 
 Via** field shows the same shipment method as the related sales document.  However, you are allowed to change this.


The delivery method is also used to:

- Estimate the  freight due on the shipment if the price quoted by the vendor is exclusive  of freight.
- To track shipments.



{:.example}
If the carrier specified for the delivery  method is Federal Express, you can track the shipment using the tracking  number.
