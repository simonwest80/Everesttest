# Terms from Purchase Invoice Date


The **Terms from purchase invoice date**  option displays only on purchase documents and allows you to define how  the due date for payment is to be calculated - from the date of purchase  invoice or from the date of vendor invoice. This option is relevant only  if the due date is automatically calculated based on the selected payment  term, that is, the **Override** option  is NOT selected.


The vendor's invoice is normally a single bill for all items in one  order and is sent after the first shipment. If the order is fulfilled  in parts, purchase receipts and/or invoices are created as and when you  receive the items.


If the payment terms are from the date of the vendor's invoice, payments  on all shipments become due on the same date regardless of the date when  the shipment was received.


{:.note}
If the vendor's invoice number and date are entered and the **Terms 
 from purchase invoice date** option is NOT checked, the due date  is calculated based on the vendor's invoice date and not on the purchase  invoice date. In this case, the vendorâ€™s invoice date becomes mandatory.


However, if the option is checked, the purchase invoice date takes precedence  over the specified vendor invoice date.


The **Terms from purchase invoice date**  option is checked by default if the **Due 
 date based on purchase invoice date** option is selected (path: **Purchasing &gt; Vendors &gt; Options &gt; Edit 
 &gt; In New Window &gt; Accounting** tab).
