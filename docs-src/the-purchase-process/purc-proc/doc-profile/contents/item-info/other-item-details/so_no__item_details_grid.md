# SO #/SI #


This column displays the sales order number to which the purchase order  is linked. Purchase orders are linked to sales orders either for drop  shipments or when you create automated orders based on existing sales  orders. Double-click in this column to view the linked sales order.


On receiving items on the purchase order, if you process the order to  a purchase receipt and the referenced sales order to an invoice simultaneously,  the sales invoice number is displayed on the **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile. If you process the sales order to an invoice subsequently,  the sales order number is displayed on the **Purchase 
 Invoice** profile.
