# Add-on Costs Columns in Purchase Orders, Receipts, and Invoices


The **Add-on Costs** column displays  the per-unit value of the add-on amounts for all the add-on costs elements  (the add-on amount divided by the quantity). The system uses the following  quantities in the calculation:

- Ordered quantity  on a purchase order
- Received quantity  on a purchase receipt
- Received on Invoice  quantity on a purchase invoice using the Received view (in the options  menu)
- Invoiced quantity  on a purchase invoice using the Invoice view (in the options menu)



This column is not displayed in purchase and debit quotes.


Use of Add-on Costs


In order to arrive at the correct cost of an item, you must include  the following costs in the item's cost:

- Packaging charges
- Loading/Unloading  charges
- Import/Export duties
- Courier charges
- Freight charges
- All other costs  that you are liable to pay the vendor for bringing the items to your offices/warehouses



Additional expenses incurred on items should be distributed across each  item purchased to arrive at the accurate purchase cost. Distribution of  additional costs is required for:

- Proper pricing  of the product to arrive at the sale cost.
- Accurate valuation  of closing inventory.



You can create new and edit existing add-on costs using [The  Add-on Costs Browser]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/misc/add_on_costs_browser_pur.html) (path: **Inventory**  > **Add-on Costs**). You can also  distribute add-on costs within a specific purchase document using [The  Add-on Costs Distribution Dialog Box]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/doc-profile/doc-options/utils/addon-costs-distr/the_freight_distribution_dialog_box.html) (path: purchase document profile  > **Options** > **Utility**  > **Add-on Costs Distribution**).
