# Customer PO No. and Date


The **Customer PO No.** and **Customer PO Date** columns display the  document number and date of the customerâ€™s purchase order. This is taken  from the sales order to which the purchase order is linked. Purchase orders  are linked to sales orders either for drop shipments or when you create  automated orders based on existing sales orders.
