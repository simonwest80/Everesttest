# Retrieve an Item Kit


The **Retrieve &gt; Item Kit** option  allows you to add item kits to the document. When an item kit is retrieved,  the item codes of all the kit components along with their respective prices  are added to the item details grid. You cannot view the item code for  the original kit.


You can retrieve only one kit at a time using the **Retrieve**  option.


{:.example}
If an item kit for a P-III computer is selected,  the item codes for each kit component such as the processor, monitor and  keyboard are added to the item details grid.
