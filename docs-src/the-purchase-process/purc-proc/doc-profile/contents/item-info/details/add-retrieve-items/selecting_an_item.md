# Add an Item 


You can add an item to a purchase document in two ways:

- From the **Options** menu
- By using the [smart search option]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/misc/add_items_smart_search_option_purch.html)

 Select Items**. You will see the **Items**  browser.
- From the browser,  highlight the item and click **OK**.  The item is added to the purchase document.



The same item can be selected more than once in a document.


{:.example}
You may select Item # 10578 in Line 1 and  again in Line 5. This is useful when quantities of an item are purchased  at different costs.

The item selected in the Item Details Grid can be a  special type of item such as an [Item  Kit]({{site.mi_chm}}/item-profile-details/item-types/kits/kits.html) or an [Matrix Item]({{site.mi_chm}}/creating-matrix-group-and-matrix-items/item_matrix.html).
