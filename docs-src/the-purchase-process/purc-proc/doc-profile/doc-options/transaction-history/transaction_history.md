# Transaction History


**Everest** records the entire history  of a transaction including the inception (purchase quote/debit quote),  order creation, deposits placed, refunds received, items received, closing  of the order, opening of the closed order, payments applied, conversion  to purchase invoice/debit memo, and modifications to the document.


You can view the **Transaction****History** browser from any of the  following locations:

- From the Purchase  Documents browser by selecting **Options**  > **Transaction** **History**.
- From the Purchase  Document profile by selecting **Options**  > **Transaction** **History**.
- From the Purchase  Document profile by selecting the **History**  tab.



The **Transaction History** browser  displays the following:

- Details of purchase  quote/order/receipt/invoice creation such as date and time of creation,  amount of document and the user who created the document.
- Details of payments  or deposits made and refunded on the document such as the payment type  and reference number; details of payments applied to the document. Â Credit  card numbers are masked using the format XXXXXXXXXXXX<last  four digits of the card> when the **Enable 
 Extended Mode** check box is cleared (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Workstation Settings &gt; Company Settings**  tab).
- Details of modifications  made to the status of the purchase order, the vendor contact and shipping  addresses, the document alias, pay terms and delivery method, location/sub-location  and jurisdiction.
- Displays whether  the transaction status is Normal, Void, Reversed, or Reversal.



To open the documents displayed in the browser, select **Open****Document** from the right-click  menu. The **Transaction History**  browser has standard options common to all browsers.
