# Advantages of Distributing Add-on Costs on Purchase Receipts and Invoices


The following are the advantages of distributing add-on costs on purchase  receipts and invoices:

- The cost of  the item will reflect the true cost which comprises the cost of purchase  and the add-on costs payable. This helps in a more accurate analysis of  profits and margins.
- The last cost  and average cost of the item displays the true cost inclusive of add-on  costs. This helps in cost comparisons.



{:.example}
A vendor charges $10 on an item exclusive  of freight of $1.50. Another vendor charges $11 inclusive of freight.  On a comparison without freight, the first vendor's price seems better,  but if freight is distributed, the second vendor's price is more attractive.

- Accounting  standards and guidelines of several countries require that add-on costs  on inventory be added to the value of the inventory, and should not be  expensed.
