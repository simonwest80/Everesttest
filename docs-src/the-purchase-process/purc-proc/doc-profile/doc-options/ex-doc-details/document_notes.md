# Document Notes


Notes can be attached to purchase documents to keep track of important  messages or information pertaining to the document (path: Purchase Document  profile > **Options** > **Document** > **Document****Notes**). The note attached to a  document is not printed along with it. It is used primarily for communication  between users within the company.


{:.example}
You can attach a note to a quote on the date  of negotiations with the vendor or about a special discount applicable  for that particular purchase transaction.


You can also set up flow control preferences to:

- **Popup 
 and first show notes attached to the document prior to opening it**  (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Preferences** > **Flow****Control** > **Documents**  > **Popups**  tab).
- **Copy 
 the notes attached to an order to receipt or invoice or attached to a 
 receipt to invoice (when converting an order to receipt/invoice or receipt 
 to invoice)** (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Preferences**  > **Flow** **Control**  > **Documents** > **Popups**  tab).



{:.note}
This only applies to notes on an order, receipt,  or invoice. Notes attached to a quote are always copied to the converted  order regardless of this setting.
