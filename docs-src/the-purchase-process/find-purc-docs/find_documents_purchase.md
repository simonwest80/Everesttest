# Find Documents


The find feature facilitates you to find purchase documents by specific  search parameters.


{:.example}
If you have a dispute with one of your vendors,  regarding duplication of a receipt, you can search all the receipts against  that vendor and verify if there has been a duplication.


The search for documents yields a browser that lists documents that  meet the specified criteria.
