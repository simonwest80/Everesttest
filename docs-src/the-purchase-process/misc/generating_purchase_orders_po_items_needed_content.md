# Generating Purchase Orders


Purchase orders can be created either for:

- Selected items  of the current vendor by using the **Create 
 PO (Current Vendor)** option.
- All selected items  for all vendors by using the **Create PO** option.



Generate PO (Current Vendor)


Select this option to create a purchase order for the currently selected  vendor only and not for other vendors, even if you have selected them.  When you select this option, you will see the [**Purchase** **Order****Status** dialog box]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/purchase_order_status_dialog_box.html).


Generate POs


This option allows you to create purchase orders for the selected items  in the browser. You must select the required item(s) before selecting  this option. After the purchase order(s) is/are created, the [**Purchase** **Order****Status** dialog box]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/pos/create-po/auto-generate-po/item-replenishment/purchase_order_status_dialog_box.html) is displayed.
