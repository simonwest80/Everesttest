# Calculate Due Date from Purchase Invoice Date


The vendor sends a single invoice (for all purchase orders placed) after  the first shipment. If the order is fulfilled in parts, purchase receipts  and/or invoices are created as and when the items are received.


If the payment terms are from the [Date]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/purc-proc/doc-profile/contents/tabs/details/payment-information/vendor_s_invoice_and_date.html)  of the vendor's invoice, payments on all shipments become due on the same  date regardles of the date when the shipment was received.


The option **Terms from purchase invoice 
 date** has been provided to compute due dates for each purchase invoice  from the date of the invoice, if the vendor's payment terms take effect  from the date of receipt of the items.


This option is checked by default if the option **Due 
 date based on purchase invoice date** has been selected in the **Vendor** profile (path: **Purchasing**  > **Vendors** > **Options 
 &gt; Edit &gt; In New Window** **&gt; 
 Accounting** tab).
