The **Amount** field displays the  amount in the vendorâ€™s or document's currency displayed in the **Amount**  field of the **Document Currency**  section. When you change the payment currency, the exchange rate defined  in **Exchange** **Rate**  (path: **File** > **Setup**  > **Accounting** > **Multi**  - **Currency** > Exchange**Rates**) profile is used to arrive  at this amount.


This amount can be edited as required. When you edit this amount, the  **Amount** fields of the Bank currency,  Base currency and Document currency sections are updated automatically,  using the existing exchange rates.
