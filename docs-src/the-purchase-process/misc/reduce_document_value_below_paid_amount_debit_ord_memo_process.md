# Reduce Document Value Below Paid Amount


After receiving the full amount of the debit order or memo from the  vendor, if you reduce the value of the document, say by changing the tax  code, **Everest** informs you that  the document is overpaid. You can choose to save the document with a negative  balance, and apply the overpaid amount to another debit order or memo.
