The **Claimed** option indicates  whether GST/VAT  has been claimed on the document and cannot be edited. When the **Input Claim PI Browser** is saved, **Everest** updates the **Claimed** check box on the purchase invoice and saves the document. The **Claimed** check box will be selected if  you mark the purchase invoice as claimed in the **Input 
 Claim PI Browser**. If the Vendorâ€™s tax invoice date has NOT been  specified, **Everest** updates the  **Tax invoice date** field with the  login date prior to saving the purchase invoice.
