# Document Payment Information


**You can select a document in the list of  outstanding documents to view the history of payments made thus far on  that document. All payments made against this document including amounts  applied from or to other documents are listed.**


{:.example}
If part of a refund due on a debit memo has  been applied to a purchase invoice, then the payment history for the debit  memo will show the amount applied to the purchase invoice and the payment  history for the purchase invoice will show amount applied from the debit  memo.
