# Difference


Differences arise when the actual costs distributed are different from  the total costs.


The difference is displayed in this field. The **Add-on 
 Costs** dialog box cannot be saved until the difference is zero.


If the total add-on costs after modification is less than the actual  cost, the **Difference** field displays  the undistributed add-on cost. Undistributed add-on cost is an expense.  This amount is not allocated against any particular item but has to be  expensed.


To add this amount to the order or receipt, click the **Insert 
 Shipping Line Item** button. The non-inventoried item specified in  the **Items** dialog box (path: **File &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Defaults 
 &gt; Items &gt; Default Item used for Shipping Charges**) is added  to the order or receipt.


Differences Due to Rounding Off


There could be differences due to rounding off when add-on costs are  automatically distributed. In this case, the difference is added to the  add-on costs of the first line item.


{:.example}
If $100 is distributed by weight among 3 line  items each weighing 100 kg, then the add-on costs calculated is $33.3333  for each. The total will not add up to $100.


If you modify the distributed add-on costs, you must ensure that the  total distributed amount exactly equals the actual add-on costs amount.
