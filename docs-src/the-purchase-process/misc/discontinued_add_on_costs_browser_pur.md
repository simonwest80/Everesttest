# The Discontinued Add-on Costs Browser


The Discontinued Add-on Costs browser displays all add-on costs which  you previously discontinued. You may reactivate any add-on cost by selecting  it in the browser and using the **Activate**  option. The newly activated add-on cost disappears from the Discontinued  Add-on Costs browser and appears in [The  Add-on Costs Browser]({{site.pp_baseurl}}/misc/add_on_costs_browser_pur.html). (If you already have the Add-on Costs browser  open, you must Refresh to see the newly activated Add-on Cost.)
