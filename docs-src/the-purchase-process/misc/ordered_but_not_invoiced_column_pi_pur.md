# Ordered but not Invoiced Column


When you convert a purchase order to a purchase invoice, this column  is populated with the quantity in the Ordered column minus the quantity  in the Invoiced column of the purchase order at the time it was converted.


When you convert a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice, or when you  create a purchase invoice directly (without first creating a purchase  order or receipt), this column displays a zero.


You cannot edit this column.
