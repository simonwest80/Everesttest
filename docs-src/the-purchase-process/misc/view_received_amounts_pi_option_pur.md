# View Received Amounts


Use this option (path: **Options**  > **View Received Amounts** or  F7) to show only what is being received on the purchase invoice. With  this option selected (**Received**  view), payment information is not applicable and does not display on the  purchase invoice. The **Tax** field  in the Document Totals displays only the non-recoverable portion of the  tax. The **Amount** column in the  item details grid reflects the received amount.
