# Other Information


The other information in the **Recurrence****Pattern** dialog box is detailed  below:


Document Date
: This section allows you to define the creation date  of purchase invoices.


**Schedule date based on recurrence pattern**
: Select this option if the purchase invoice date  has to be based on the recurrence pattern.


{:.example}
You define the recurrence pattern as "the  first of every month" and select the **Schedule 
 date based on recurrence pattern** option. You then log into Everest  on 15th of May and process the purchase order dated 1st May. The creation  date of the purchase invoice will be 1st May.


**Date when the order is actually converted to  final**
: Select this option if the purchase invoice date  should be independent of the recurrence pattern.


{:.example}
In the previous example, if you select the  **Date when the order is actually converted 
 to final** option, the purchase invoice will be dated 15th May.


**Create reminder tasks to convert purchase order  into invoice on the scheduled dates**
: Select this option to create automatic reminder  tasks using the **Contact Manager**  function in **Everest** reminding  you to convert the purchase orders to purchase invoices on the specified  due date. Clear this option if you do not want automatic reminder tasks.  If you select this option, when you define the recurrence pattern and  click **OK**, tasks are automatically  created.


**Notes**
: Details entered  in the **Notes** field of the **Recurrence Pattern** dialog box display  as **Notes** in the reminder tasks.
