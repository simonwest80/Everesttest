# Discount Amount


This column indicates the total discount offered for the line item.  The system calculates it as the discount value multiplied by the quantity.


You may enter your own amount in this column. If you do, the system  recalculates the Discount Value column as the newly entered Discount Amount  divided by the quantity. The Discount Percentage column also recalculates  accordingly. The system uses the following quantities in the calculations:

- Ordered quantity  on a purchase order
- Received quantity  on a purchase receipt
- Received on Invoice  quantity on a purchase invoice using the Receipt View
- Invoiced quantity  on a purchase invoice using the Invoice View
