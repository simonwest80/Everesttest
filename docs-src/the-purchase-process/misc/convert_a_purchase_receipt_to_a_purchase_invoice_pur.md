# Convert an Existing Purchase Receipt to a Purchase Invoice


You can process a purchase receipt to a purchase invoice by using the  **Invoice** option (path: **Purchase 
 Receipt** profile > **Options**  > **Process** > **Invoice**).  Many of the details of the receipt are copied to a **Purchase 
 Invoice** profile.
