The **Exchange** **Rate**  field displays the current rate of exchange between the bank currency  and the base currency defined in the **Exchange****Rate** profile (path: **File**  > **Setup** > **Accounting**  > **Multi****c****urrency**  > **Exchange Rates**). You can  change this rate if required. When you change the rate, the **Amount**  fields of the Bank currency section also change correspondingly.
