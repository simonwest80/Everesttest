# Shipment Tracking Information Browser


This browser allows you to enter the tracking number for the shipment.  The tracking numbers can also be scanned into the system using a bar code  scanner. Multiple shipment tracking numbers can be entered with different  delivery methods for each shipment. If you ship the items using only one  delivery method, you can enter the shipment tracking number in the **Shipment** **Tracking 
 #** field of the **Debit** **Memo** profile.


The shipment date defaults to the login date and the delivery method  defaults to the document's delivery method. You can change these as required.
