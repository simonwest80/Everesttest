# Ordered but not Received


When you convert a purchase order to a purchase receipt, this column  in the receipt populates with the quantity in the Ordered column minus  the quantity in the Received column of the purchase order at the time  you converted it.


When you create a purchase receipt directly (without first creating  a purchase order), this column displays a zero.


You cannot edit this column.
