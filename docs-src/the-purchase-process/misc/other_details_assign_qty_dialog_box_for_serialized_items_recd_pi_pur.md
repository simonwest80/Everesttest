# Other Details


**Assigned**
: If you create the purchase invoice from an order  or receipt, the **Assigned** column  displays all the serial numbers attached to the order/receipt with reference  to the stock bin to which they are currently assigned. To assign a serial  number to a stock bin, highlight the stock bin in the left panel and use  the < and << buttons.


{:.note}
To un-assign a serial number from a stock bin use the  **&gt;** and **&gt;&gt;**  buttons. If the serial number is not assigned to any other stock bin,  it is un-assigned from the document when you click **OK**.
: When you create a purchase invoice directly, this  column displays the number of items attached to the selected stock bin.


**Available on Order**
: If you convert a purchase order or receipt to an  invoice, this column displays a list of serial numbers attached to the  order/receipt that are not assigned to the stock bin selected in the left  panel.
: Use the < and << buttons to assign the  serial numbers to the required stock bins. When you assign the serial  numbers to other stock bins, the quantities are automatically reduced  from the originally assigned stock bin.
: When you create a purchase invoice directly, this  column does not display any value.
