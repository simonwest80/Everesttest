# Print Put Away Report


The **Put Away Report**  is a specially designed report to indicate the put away bins of the received  line items sorted by location and warehouse positions. The Stock Bins  and Put Away columns in the report are immensely helpful when putting  away or stocking received items.


Use this option to print the location of the **Put 
 Away** bins for the received items from a Purchase Receipt and Purchase  Invoice document. The **Put Away**  bins in the report are sorted according to warehouse position. When there  is more than one location defined for a line item, the locations are sorted  alphabetically.


{:.steps}

- From the Purchase  Receipts or Purchase Invoices document browser, highlight the required  record.

 Away Report**. You will see the Put Away Report dialog box.
- Select the number  of copies and the printer from the drop-down list.
- Click **Print**.



For drop ship items, the Stock Bin column displays “DS” for  drop ship.
