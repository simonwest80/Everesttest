# Other Details


**Assigned**
: If you create the purchase receipt from an order,  the **Assigned** column displays all  the serial numbers attached to the order with reference to the stock bin  to which they are currently assigned. To assign a serial number to a stock  bin, highlight the stock bin in the left panel and use the < and <<  buttons.


{:.note}
To un-assign a serial number from a stock bin use the  **&gt;** and **&gt;&gt;**  buttons. If the serial number is not assigned to any other stock bin,  it is un-assigned from the document when you click **OK**.
: When you create a purchase receipt directly, this  column displays the number of items attached to the selected stock bin.


**Available on Order**
: If you convert a purchase order to a receipt, this  column displays a list of serial numbers attached to the order that are  not assigned to the stock bin selected in the left panel.
: Use the < and << buttons to assign the  serial numbers to the required stock bins. When you assign the serial  numbers to other stock bins, the quantities are automatically reduced  from the originally assigned stock bin.
