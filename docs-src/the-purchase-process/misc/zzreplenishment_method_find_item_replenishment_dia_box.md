The **Planned Quantity**  is the restocking point or the replenishment quantity. Select one of the  three options to use for the replenishment planning of the item:

- **Maximum

- **Reorder

- **Minimum 
 Quantity** - Allows you to replenish the item when item stock falls  below the minimum level defined for the location. Minimum Quantity is  the minimum quantity of an item required in stock.



By default, the **Maximum 
 Quantity** option is selected. If you do not want to purchase items  in large quantities, you can select either the **Reorder 
 Point** or **Minimum Quantity**.
