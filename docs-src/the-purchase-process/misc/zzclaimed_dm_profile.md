The **Claimed** option indicates  whether GST/VAT has been claimed on the document and cannot be edited.  The **Claimed** check box is updated  if you mark the debit memo as claimed in the **Input 
 Claim PI Browser**. While marking debit memos as claimed, if the  vendorâ€™s tax refund invoice date is NOT specified on the debit memo, **Everest** updates the **Inv. 
 Date** field with the login date prior to saving the debit memo.
