Select either the **Primary Vendor**,  **Vendor with lowest standard cost**,  or **Associated Vendor** option to  retrieve the items associated with the vendors. By default, the **Primary Vendor** option is selected. If  you select the **Vendor with lowest standard 
 cost** option, the Vendor Standard Cost is automatically selected  in the **Cost selection method** drop-down  field. If you select the **Associated****Vendor** option, all vendors associated  with items display in the **Vendor**  field on the **Item Selection** tab;  vendors not associated with any items do not appear in the **Vendor**  field.
