# Payment Dialog Box - Payment Details


This section allows you to specify the payment details for the debit  order.


**Batch Processing**
: This option allows you to process payments in a  batch. When you select this check box, the transactions are transferred  to the **Batch Payment Processing - Others**  browser (path: **Accounting &gt; Accounts 
 Payable &gt; Batch Payment Processing**). Accounting entries recording  the payment/refund are created only when these transactions are processed  from the **Batch Payment Processing - Others**  browser.
: This check box is displayed/hidden depending on  the preference you set for processing payments (path: **File 
 &gt; Setup &gt; Preferences &gt; Flow Control &gt; Documents &gt; Miscellaneous**  tab > **Document payments** tab  > **Batch Payments** section).  You must possess adequate security rights to select this box.
