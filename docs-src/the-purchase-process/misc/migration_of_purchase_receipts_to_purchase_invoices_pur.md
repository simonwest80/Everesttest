# Migration of Purchase Receipts to Purchase Invoices


If you upgrade from a previous version of **Everest**  to **Everest** Version 4.0 or later,  please note the following changes to the purchase receipt/purchase invoice  process:

- Each existing purchase  receipt becomes a purchase invoice (there is no longer a purchase receipt).
- The purchase receipt  number and date become the purchase invoice number and date.
- The Ordered quantity  carries from the receipt to the invoice.
- The Received quantity  carries from the receipt to the invoice.
- The Ordered but  not Invoiced quantity in the invoice populates with the Ordered quantity  minus the Received quantity from the receipt.
- The Received but  not Invoiced quantity in the invoice displays a zero.
- The Invoiced quantity  in the invoice updates with the Received quantity from the receipt.
- The Received on  Invoice quantity in the invoice updates with the Received quantity from  the receipt.
- All other information  from the purchase receipt tabs carries from the receipt to the invoice.
