The **Reference**/**Check** No field displays the reference number for the payment. If the payment method is a check type of payment, and you want to issue a manual check, enter the check number. You will be prompted if there is a duplicate check number for that bank. If this field is left blank, a computerized check will be printed when you print checks for this transaction. Where the payment method is any other type of payment, enter the reference number for the payment.
