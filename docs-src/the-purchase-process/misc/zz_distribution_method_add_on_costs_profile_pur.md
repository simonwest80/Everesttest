: You can allocate costs using any of the following  methods:

- Weight - Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the weight of the items (i.e., items weighing  more take on more of the add-on cost).
- Amount – Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the monetary value of the items (i.e., items  which cost more take on more of the add-on costs).
- Volume - Distribute  add-on costs in proportion to the volume of the items (i.e., items in  larger volume take on more of the add-on cost).
- Quantity –  Distribute add-on costs in proportion to the quantity of each item (i.e.,  items purchased in greater quantities take on more of the add-on cost).
- User specified  - Enter the add-on costs manually for each item.
