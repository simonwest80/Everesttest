# The Rename Add-on Cost ID Dialog Box


The Rename Add-on Cost ID dialog box allows you to change the ID of  an add-on cost element. When you rename an ID, the ID changes everywhere  in the system including existing and even posted documents.


{:.example}
If you currently use the Add-on Cost ID called  Warehouse\_2005, but the year just changed to 2006, you should create a  new ID called Warehouse\_2006 instead of using the Rename option. If you  rename Warehouse\_2005 to Warehouse\_2006, the Add-on Cost ID in all of  the previous documents changes to Warehouse\_2006.


**Old Add-on Cost ID**
: This field displays the current ID of the add-on  cost element you selected to rename.


**New Add-on Cost ID**
: Enter the new add-on cost ID in this field. You  can enter a maximum of 15 characters made up of numbers, capital and lowercase  letters, and the following characters:


| # | ; | \_ |
| - | , | > |
| : | / | < |

: All other characters are restricted.
