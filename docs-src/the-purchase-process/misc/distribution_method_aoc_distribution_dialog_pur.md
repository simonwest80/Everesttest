# Distribution Method


Displays the Distribution Method of the selected add-on cost ID. You  may edit the distribution method if you have not yet posted the purchase  journal. Changing the distribution method here only affects this particular  document; it does not affect the linked documents (although the amount  recalculates based on the new distribution method) and it does not affect  future documents because they will still  use  the original distribution method for the add-on cost ID.


When you edit the distribution method, the system automatically recalculates  each line item’s add-on cost in the bottom grid based on the new distribution  method.


When you edit the add-on cost itself for an item in the bottom grid,  the distribution method automatically changes to “User Specified.”
