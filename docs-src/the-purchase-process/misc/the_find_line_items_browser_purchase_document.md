# The Find Line Items Browser


The **Find Line Items** browser  displays all the line items present in a purchase/purchase return document.  It allows you to search for a particular line item listed in the purchase/purchase  return document.


{:.example}
You want to search for the item **Cadbury's 
 Chocolate** from among 15 items on a purchase document. Instead of  scrolling through the items in the purchase document, use this option  to locate the item.


Inline notes are not displayed in this browser.
