Specify the payment term allowed by the vendor. For new purchase documents,  this field defaults to the payment term defined for the vendor in the  **Payment Terms** field of the Vendor  profile (path: **Purchasing** >  **Vendors** > **Options**  > **Edit** > **In 
 New Window** > **Accounting**  tab). When converting existing purchase documents, the terms on the preceding  document carry forward to the new document. When converting purchase documents  from multiple originating documents, the default vendor terms are used.  You can select another payment term.
