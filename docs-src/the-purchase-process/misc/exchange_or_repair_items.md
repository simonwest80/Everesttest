# Exchange or Repair Items


You can create debit orders to track items that are sent to the vendor  for repair or exchange. To track such items, do the following:

- Select a stock  area of stock type Repair for assigning items on debit order in your workstation  settings. The type of stock area must be Stock as you retain ownership  of the item and the item continues to be in your inventory even though  it has been physically sent to the vendor.



{:.example}
You can create a stock area called For Exchange.

Create a debit order and attach the items returned for repair or exchange.

- When the item  is received from the vendor after repair or exchange, detach the item  from the debit order. If the item has been sent for exchange and it is  serialized, you can continue to use the same serial number but you can  change the manufacturer's serial number.
- Close the debit  order.
