# The Journal Transactions Browser


The **Journal** **Transactions**  browser is displayed when you click the Posted/Unposted section (in the  status bar) of the **Purchase** **Receipt**/**Debit****Memo** profile.


This browser displays the accounting entries created in the system when  the purchase receipt/debit memo is saved. The browser displays details  such as the accounts that are debited or credited, the account entry type,  the amount of debit/credit, the purchase journal and transaction number  in which the entry was recorded, the document number and date and the  source of the transaction.


{:.example}
The ACP account can have an entry type of  "Accrued Purchase" or "Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)".  If a PPV account arises due to a price change, it does not have an entry  type. If a PPV account arises to offset an accrued purchases adjustment  (the ACP adjustment offsets an imbalance in the ACP account), it displays  the entry type “Accrued Purchase (Adjustment)”.


Use the option **View** **in****Base** **Currency**  (path: **Journal** **Transactions**  browser > **Options** > **View** **in****Base** **Currency**)  to view the amounts in base currency. This is a toggle option that also  allows you to view the amounts in the vendor’s currency.
