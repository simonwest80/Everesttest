# Refund Dialog Box - Prior Payments


This tab is displayed when you receive a refund on a purchase order  from a foreign currency vendor. If you make advance payments to the vendor  (over a period of time) at different exchange rates, this tab allows you  to specify the payment that must be applied as a refund.


This tab comprises two sections:

- **Advance 
 Document Available** - Displays all available deposits on the current  purchase order. Available deposits are those that are not applied on a  purchase invoice.
- **Advance 
 Document Applied** - All advances that you apply to the current document  are displayed in this column. Use the > and >> buttons to move  the available deposits from the **Advance 
 Documents Available** column to this column. You can change the amount  being applied in the **Amount** column.



The amount applied cannot be greater than the amount available. The  total amount applied is displayed in the **Amount**  field (path: **Refund** dialog box  > **General** tab).


When you receive a refund, a transaction is automatically created in  a payment journal.
