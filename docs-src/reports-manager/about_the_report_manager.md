# About the Reports Manager 


Reports in **Everest** are built  using "Business Objects Crystal Reports". The **Reports 
 Manager** allows you to do the following:

- Create the  user interface for new reports. A report contains details of various activities/events  occurred in **Everest** for a given  period of time. However, the report files must be created using Business Objects  Crystal Reports.

: ![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/example.gif) Â Generate  a report for the list of tasks that were created during a specified period  (path: **Reports** > **Miscellaneous**  > **Task** **List**).  Specify the dates to be included in the report in the **Create 
 Date From** and **Create Date To**  fields.

- Customize the  standard reports built into **Everest**.
- Create batches  of reports and schedule the generation of these reports.



Types of Reports


**Files in Reports Manager are of two 
 types**:

- .rpt file
- .czr  file



The .czr![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/rm_czr_file.gif) file and the .rpt![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/rm_rpt_file.gif) file have different icons to represent them.


**.rpt File**
: Reports created or modified using Business Objects Crystal  Reports are called Crystal reports. Crystal reports are files with .rpt  extension.


**.czr File**
: When a crystal report file (.rpt file) is associated  with **Everest** by using the **Reports Manager**, a .czr file is created.  These files contain the parameter information, dialog information and  the .rpt file.
: The .czr files are registered with the **Reports 
 Manager** to allow these reports to be run from **Everest** using the database of the logged in company.
