# Running Report From a Local Machine


You can run reports from a local machine if the **Local 
 Repository** of the user and the **Batch 
 Reports** are residing on local machines and not on the server.


Similarly, you can run a report from a local machine where you have  installed **Everest** as a stand-alone  configuration (both application server and data server in one computer).
