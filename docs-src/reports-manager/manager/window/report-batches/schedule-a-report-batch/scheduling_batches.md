# Schedule a Batch


You can schedule your report batches so that reports are generated and  printed on hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis. A batch report is  displayed in the left panel under Report Batch. All scheduled batches  are indicated with the ![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/rm_sche_batch.gif) icon beside their description in  the left panel, and all unscheduled batches are denoted by the ![]({{site.rmgr_baseurl}}/img/rm_unsche_batch.gif) icon. A [**Reminder** dialog Box]({{site.cm_chm}}/reminders-tasks-appointments/the-reminder-dialog-box/the_reminder_dialog_box.html) is displayed  at the time and date specified to run the report batch.
